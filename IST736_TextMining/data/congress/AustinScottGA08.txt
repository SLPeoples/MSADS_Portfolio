Always great to have Georgia ag advocates visit Capitol Hill. Had a great meeting with @GaFarmBureau Young Farmers and Ranchers and Land and Leadership Advocates committees this morning on Hurricane Michael disaster relief, 2018 Farm Bill implementation, ag trade, and much more.
I sat down with @FarmMonitor’s John Holcomb this morning to talk about Hurricane Michael disaster assistance, @OcmulgeeNPS1 expansion, #ruralbroadband, and @HouseAgGOP outlook for the 116th Congress. #GA08

The truth about #HR1: It would funnel millions of your tax dollars to politicians’ campaigns that you may not agree with. This bill is #ForthePoliticians and no one else.
Last night, @SanfordBishop, @RepBuddyCarter, I joined GA Fruit Vegetable Growers Assoc., @GovKemp, Ag Commissioner Black, @GaFarmBureau via teleconference for an update on disaster assistance. We've been fighting for this since Oct, we will see it through until the end.
Last night, deadly tornadoes ripped through parts of Georgia, Alabama, and Florida. As first responders, law enforcement officials, and utility crews continue to search for the missing and begin cleanup efforts, our prayers are with those impacted by the storms.

.@Acosta was attacking @POTUS saying there is no "imminent danger" at the "tranquil" US/Mexico border. Meanwhile, real journalists at @CNN posted the following story from right down the road.
Dems are bringing to the Floor spending bills that have no chance in the Senate. For all their talk on urgency of reopening the gov, they're wasting time w/ bills that fail to fulfill the priorities of millions of Americans address security, humanitarian crises at our border.
Stop drugs. Stop crime. Protect Americans. #SecureOurBorder. Border security is national security.

Border patrol agents, law enforcement officials, and millions of Americans across our nation have shown that enhancing security along our border is a priority to them, and up until @POTUS sought to fulfill this priority, Democrats wanted it too. (3/4)
They have again shown that they are more concerned with opposing @POTUS than protecting Americans and supporting our law enforcement officials. (2/4)
Yesterday, on the first day of the new Congress, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle chose to put forth a reckless spending bill to reopen the government that lacked the necessary funds to secure our border and protect the homeland. (1/4)

Democrats are more concerned with denying the President than helping our country.
What the mainstream media fails to report is that in addition to fulfilling Trump’s request on border security $, the House was also able to secure in the CR $8B in disaster assistance for GA, FL, AL, CA the Carolinas. This CR is a win-win.
I voted YES on the amended CR that included disaster assistance for GA farmers families @POTUS’s $5B request for border security. The CR now heads back to the Senate where I hope they’ll swiftly pass it to keep the gov open, secure our border deliver disaster assistance.
