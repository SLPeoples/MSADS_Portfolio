This is exactly correct by @AOC. My piece today makes the same argument. Robust oversight of #TrumpCorruption is essential, beginning w/ his business and tax returns.
We must work together to combat climate change — our grandchildren are depending on us. That’s why I’m supporting the #GreenNewDeal.
I'm fortunate to work with the remarkable women of the 116th Congress, including @RepBonnie and @RepSherrill. In #NJ09 alone, 26 women were elected in 2018. Today we celebrate women who are leading the fight for a better future. #WomensDay⁠
The House just approved #HR1, a sweeping anti-corruption bill that will strengthen our democracy require presidential VP candidates to disclose their tax returns. Today we raise the bar on government ethics. This is a big deal.
Michael Cohen’s testimony made even more urgent that we need to see Trump’s business and personal tax returns — and we need to see them now. My oped lays it all
For all the media talk, Democrats stand united against antisemitism and anti-Muslim bigotry. Incredibly, republicans are divided on condemning hate.
The new Congress is committed to oversight of rampant corruption. And we’ll continue our work by soon passing #HR1.
The @BGCA_Clubs do such important work in our communities. I was enthralled to meet Boys and Girls leaders from #Garfield, NJ and congratulate Carlos who won 2017 Natl Youth of the Year. Impressive young men!
The Presidential Tax Transparency Act I sponsor with @RepAnnaEshoo will require any candidate for President or VP to disclose their tax returns. The House will soon pass the landmark #HR1, which includes a tax returns requirement. The new House is fighting political corruption.
During a @WaysMeansCmte hearing on the need for #infrastructure investment, a colleague questioned the need for federal transit funding suggesting not every American benefits. Thankfully Eisenhower didn't think this way w/our highway system! That's absurd -- with all due respect.
The @NJ_REALTORS visited our nation’s capital today and we had a good discussion on efforts to strengthen flood insurance and provide #SALT reform for Jersey taxpayers.
I’m proud today to sign onto H.Res. 109, the landmark #GreenNewDeal to combat climate change.
The #GopTaxScam imperiled our children’s economic future to give their corporate donors more money.When republicans said their tax scam would pay for itself that was an audacious lie.
The new Congress is applying scrupulous oversight of rampant #TrumpCorruption. After years of dereliction we are committed to being the Article I branch once more.
This is good. Congressional scrutiny of Trump’s interactions w/ Putin is long overdue.
@PreetBharara I second this @PreetBharara. In May 2017, I asked Mnuchin to confirm if the #TrumpTaxReturns are under audit, and if so, if that prevented him from providing the returns to Congress under 26 USC § 6103. Crickets.
Exactly right. We must request the #TrumpTaxReturns pursuant to our clear power under the law in 26 § USC 6103(f) without delay.
I’m so sad for Otto’s family. This is a disgrace to America.
Toxic misinformation poisons our society and is the equivalent of contaminated food. These trusted businesses should yank a prime purveyor of that misinformation from their shelves.
Twice @AOC correctly raised that the #TrumpTaxReturns would likely reveal evidence of criminal conduct by Donald Trump, twice Trump's long-time personal lawyer responded in the affirmative. Waiting is not an option. Congress can must conduct oversight of Trump's taxes now.
There’s no reason to delay anymore. Under 26 USC § 6103(f) Congress can get the #TrumpTaxReturns by writing a letter and slapping on a stamp. I’ll even deliver it
I’m very proud to receive a 91% voting score for 2018 from @LCVoters. And I’m excited that our new Congress will be fully dedicated to combating climate change, standing up for clean air and water, and protecting wildlife.
This is a historic day. At long last, the House just passed universal background checks. After 25 years of waiting, the new Congress is pursuing commonsense gun violence reform. And we’re not done yet. #HR8 #EnoughIsEnough
As I said at today’s hearing on China trade relations, we must not accept a quick offer of procurement of US goods rather than lasting reforms to China’s unfair practices. @USTradeRep Lighthizer must stick to his stated goal of seeing these reforms to fruition.
An audit by Trump’s own Treasury Dept found that capping the #SALT deduction will hit 11,000,000 tax filers this year.My bill would remove those caps and give middle class New Jerseyans relief from the
There is no natl emergency. This is a crisis created by Trump to seed division. Congress is the Article I branch, the preeminent branch. For too long we have ceded our responsibilities to the imperial presidency. It is our job to check exec overreach, and we did just that.
One of my colleagues, a duly elected member of Congress, has taken to twitter to intimidate a witness. This is grossly unethical and probably illegal (18 USC § 1512(b)).House Ethics must investigate this disgrace and stain on our institution.
Over $15.6B for military projects are threatened by Trump’s #FakeEmergency. New Jersey is poised to lose $51.2M. These are needed jobs to support our readiness and servicemen/women that will be lost if Congress doesn't stop Trump's overreach.
Last night, the National Italian American Foundation met w/ freshmen reps to the Italian American Congressional Delegation. Welcome to @RepBrindisi @RepJoeMorelle @RepWexton and other new members!
Congress must protect Article I legislative prerogative and stand up to executive overreach.Today we vote to terminate Trump’s #FakeEmergency.
What depressing statistics. Just like it weakened SALT, the #GopTaxScam battered the charitable deduction, depriving lifeblood resources to countless needy groups. And all to give tax cuts to the one percent.
Jon Stewart has been a champion for 9/11 survivors and their families. It’s great to see him again today as we fight for permanent authorization of the Sept 11 Victim Compensation Fund. #Renew911VCF
Climate change is a threat to our natl security. The Trump admin’s disdain for sound science is a dangerous affront.
This thread is a timely reminder that Trump’s luxury hotel remains a honeypot of corruption that may violate the Constitution.
The National Enquirer tabloid is a geyser of toxic misinformation and a possible vehicle of criminal activity. I’ve called on the leaders of our largest trusted supermarkets to pull it from their shelves.
Last month, I wrote for @washingtonpost on congressional dysfunction caused by decades of institutional vandalism. @NormOrnstein I sat down recently to discuss how we can reverse this trend put Congress back to work.
“Last year, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin predicted ‘there won’t be a change’ in the share of Americans receiving refunds.”Another lie about the #GopTaxScam.
There’s a reason why republicans didn’t campaign on their signature achievement of the last Congress.
The Trump admin is targeting a public health program that’s been successfully keeping people healthy for nearly 50 years. We’re going to fight to keep #SaveTitleX for the millions who rely on it for
Americans were crushed by the #GOPTaxScam when republicans gutted the #SALT deduction to give more money to their corporate donors. Our new Stop the Attack on Local Taxpayers Act will reverse some of the damage to help the middle class. @SenatorMenendez
The #GopTaxScam jammed into law by our used car salesman of a President and his republican cronies gave a wet kiss to the super rich and big corporations.@SenatorMenendez and I have a new bill to give tax relief to the the middle class. Read
If you’re filing your taxes and got no refund, just remember: republicans gave the super rich and big business $1.5 trillion in tax cuts. That’s where your refund went.
New Jersey moves closer to requiring Pres/VP nominees to disclose their tax returns. I have a similar #sunlight bill in Congress. Americans deserve to know if a candidate for the highest office is compromised.
The layers of #TrumpCorruption infecting our govt are staggering. This budding scandal is a doozy. So much for dredging the
It’s my pleasure to cosponsor @joaquincastro’s resolution to end Donald Trump’s divisive, illegal #FakeEmergency.
The continuing rise of right wing domestic terrorism remains one of the most dangerous threats facing Americans. Thank you to law enforcement for your vigilance.
It’s a snow day here in Washington, but kids are having a ball sledding down actual Capitol Hill. H/T @EleanorNorton for helping lift the grinch-like toboggan ban in 2016! ️ ️ �
If this report is accurate, the President committed obstruction of justice. That Trump would seek to impede a criminal probe again makes clear that Congress must see his tax records. If this report is true, Trump is unfit to serve and must resign.
“Remember, remember always, that all of us, and you and I especially, are descended from immigrants and revolutionists.” #FDRHappy #PresidentsDay
It’s a comedy show. And you’re not a king.

By capping the State and Local (#SALT) Deduction, @HouseGOP punished taxpayers, first responders, communities in blue states like NJ. My SALT Act will end republican-caused double taxation lift the cap on this deduction so crucial to my state.
On Day 2 of his #fakeemergency, he golfed.
Trump decamped to maralago immediately after claiming there is a national emergency. Says it all. #FakeEmergency
It is my pleasure to cosponsor @davidcicilline’s new bill to ban assault weapons. This Congress is serious about passing commonsense gun laws. Finally!
Hey @dracioppi I agree! I receive and read every daily, weekly, and ethnic paper in #NJ09. Newspapers are still the best way to follow our communities. #SupportLocalMedia
I’ve fought to preserve Historic Tax Credits targeted by the #GOPTaxScam. Restoration of storied buildings help revitalize our communities. Thank you @GovMurphy and @andresayegh for your leadership in helping secure a more prosperous future for cities like #Paterson.
That’s a 10-4. The #GopTaxScam is taking taxpayers to the cleaners. Refunds are plummeting. Our Stop the Attack on Local Taxpayers Act will give money back to middle class communities where it belongs.
We have a Constitution in this country. I carry it in my pocket every day. Trump should consult it, specifically Article I, Sec 9, Clause 7, which I’ll provide for him below.There’s no money allocated for a stupid wall and no fake emergency can override that.
I care.There is no emergency. It’s completely made up by this man. He’s making a power grab and acting like a dictator. Trump’s contempt for rule of law is the real emergency.
I’m pleased there won’t be another shutdown and there will be no wall. But if there were an emergency, why did Trump never mention it when republicans held every lever of govt? Trump is using a fake emergency to try to grab dictatorial power.
The scale of this fire is horrific. I’ve spoken w/ Mayor Sokolich and will continue to monitor. Over 100 of our neighbors have been displaced. The Red Cross has been called. Pray for the residents and our firefighters and first responders.

.@HouseGOP is sputtering that any oversight of the #TrumpTaxReturns is “abusive.”But icymi, last week, republicans’ own witness said they committed a felony by releasing dozens of private citizens’ tax returns in 2014.

The American Dream is slipping away. Children are now less likely to be better off than their parents. Tax cuts for the wealthy is not tax reform. At today’s hearing we discussed real reforms to reverse these terrible trends.
It looks like we have a budget deal. It accomplished what we set out for: an open government. And we’re not getting a stupid wall from sea to shining
Last night New Jersey’s leaders celebrated @SamsungUS’s 40 years headquartered in #RidgefieldPark. An innovative company and employer for our state! @SamsungDC
This @jonathanchait piece does a nice job of showing that republicans’ stated reasons for trying to block oversight of the #TrumpTaxReturns are nonsensical

W/ @SenatorMenendez @RepChrisSmith and my colleagues, we have introduced the bipartisan Stop Attacks on Local Taxpayers (#SALT) Act. Taxpayers are getting hammered this year and our bill will provide needed #TaxFairness!

Our Stop the Attack on Local Taxpayers Act will also give relief to single mothers and fathers to the tune of $1,485 — that’s not chump change. #TaxFairness
The impact of republicans’ cap on the SALT deduction has had a profoundly negative impact for our state. My legislation w/@SenatorMenendez will give NJ families savings of $2,533. #TaxFairness
When republicans capped our State Local Tax (#SALT) deduction, they took a swing at NJ. I’m in #SaddleBrook w/ @SenatorMenendez and colleagues, accountants, taxpayers to announce our bipartisan legislation to restore this dedication for NJ families.
Walter Jones always did what he thought was right. He was guided by his principles and never the passions of the moment. Walter sought bipartisanship and we worked together frequently. He was also my friend. I will miss him enormously. I mourn with the Jones family.
Thank you @StephenAtHome! And yes: Congress seeking the #TrumpTaxReturns is about being methodical and doing our job.
Perceptive editorial. What Trump calls “harassment” is Congress doing its job investigating a swamp of exec branch corruption. This new Congress takes its oversight responsibilities
This is a stunning autopsy. Laid out in brutal detail by @Publici, the #GopTaxScam was passed at the behest of republicans’ billionaire donors.Who picked up their tab? You
#Sunlight on the #TrumpTaxReturns will reveal whether Donald Trump has any financial conflicts of interest and if his decisions are impacted by foreign entanglements. Thank you @cspan for having me!

They called John ‘Mr. Chairman’ not because of seniority but out of respect. There wasn’t a colleague, ever, that had a cross word for John. He is one of the greatest members that ever came through this place. My family grieves with Debbie.
It’s been a long road, but we’re finally moving to expose Trump to true transparency. Americans deserve to know if their leader is a crook. Thank you as always for your yeoman’s work
Remember this the next time republicans claim that exposing the #TrumpTaxReturns to sunlight is a “fishing expedition.” Talk about chutzpah.
There is a lot disingenuousness at this hearing. Congress didn’t need to request Trump’s modern predecessors’ tax returns bc they all disclosed them voluntarily!
I submitted for the @WaysMeansCmte oversight hearing record three stories laying out troubling financial dealings from this president. There are plenty more. #Sunlight

There’s more baloney in this thread than in a butcher shop.
As Trump thunders incoherently at any oversight, Democrats are prepared to conduct a thorough analysis of the #TrumpTaxReturns so that we can see any potential conflicts of interest he may have. Americans have waited long enough for #sunlight.

I know. I sat through it.
This was a touching moment in the chamber. But we must pass real, commonsense gun control measures. Americans cry out for them.Will Trump and republicans finally work with us to stop gun violence? #EnoughIsEnough
OTOH, hearing my republican colleagues clapping for our withdrawal from the INF treaty makes my blood boil. Trump’s idiotic move will hasten a nuclear arms race. The only other one who likes it is Putin.
While the speech mentions Russia, I am proud to wear a Ukrainian flag tonight in solidarity with our ally and friend as Ukraine’s people continue to stand against Russian aggression. ����
NAFTA has harmed our workers and manufacturing. No doubt. We need reforms for our workers. Will Trump bring jobs back? Jury’s still out. But he must work with @HouseDemocrats on any deal!
While this speech is mostly about seeding division, my colleagues stand up for unity, rights and human dignity. I’m humbled to sit beside these powerful leaders tonight. #WearWhite
We’re groaning because it’s an outrageous lie.
