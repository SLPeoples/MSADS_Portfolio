I want to thank Ambassador Cui for coming to meet with our Asia Subcommittee this morning where we talked about bilateral trade, North Korea, intellectual property protections, and the broader U.S.-China relationship.
I was pleased to sit down with the executive director of Hollywood Burbank airport, Mr. Frank Miller today. We discussed flight paths, curfews, and concrete steps to reduce airport noise in the San Fernando Valley.

(3) Works to reduce support for Israel in one political party, in order to achieve a partisan advantage for his own party.
(2) While pretending to support Israel, seeks to undermine bipartisan support for Israel, often by introducing uni-partisan “pro-Israel” Resolutions.
(1) #Pseudo Zionist (n.) Person who claims to be supporting the U.S. - Israel Alliance, while actually using Israel as a political football.
I am pleased to see my friends at the @AmerMedicalAssn continuing to take a stand against the Trump administration’s degradation of reproductive rights by joining their colleagues to block the #TitleX gag rule. #NoGagRule
I commend India and Pakistan for continuing to show restraint. We must never forget that no one can win a war between nuclear-armed powers. I will continue to monitor the situation closely.
(3) Kim will never agree to an acceptable deal unless President Trump is willing to increase pressure on North Korea, especially by sanctioning large Chinese banks, as @RepTedYoho and I have called for.
(2) South Korean President Moon also said that Trump "made it clear that he had no intention of pressuring North Korea by strengthening sanctions or military exercises." #Trumpcapitulation
(1) South Korean President Moon Jae-in just said that Trump is "expressing his unwavering trust in Chairman Kim Jong-un." Trump trusts Putin, Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia, and Kim. He doesn't trust the FBI or Climate Scientists.

Donald Trump is right. Kim Jong-un is wrong. North Korea was really demanding the lifting of all the important UN sanctions against its economy. In return, North Korea offered to stop making fissile material at one site but continue making it at other sites.
#Trump's record on who he trusts and doesn't trust:
Today @marcorubio, @SenMarkey, @RepTedYoho and I reintroduced legislation to strengthen Congressional oversight of any civil nuclear cooperation between U.S. and Saudi Arabia. For more details, click here:
The #TrumpKimSummit has ended with no deal reached. If we want a better deal, we need to apply stronger sanctions. Please find my full statement here:
(2) Pakistan’s decision to release the pilot is both unexpected and helpful.
(1) It was a pleasure meeting with Pakistan’s Ambassador Asad Khan in my office today. I thanked Pakistan for agreeing to release the Indian pilot who was shot down this week, while urging further restraint from both Delhi and Islamabad.
I will be discussing the Trump-Kim summit on Bloomberg TV in a few moments (6:10 pm EST, 3:10 PM Pacific).
We all hope that India and Pakistan will exercise maximum restraint during the current crisis. Diplomacy is the only path to resolve this conflict.
Pleased that my staff just met with the staff of @SenFeinstein, @SenKamalaHarris, and @RepAdamSchiff to discuss airport noise and the need for quiet skies with the @FAANews at their regional offices.
Today, @GovRichardson and other distinguished witnesses previewed the upcoming #TrumpKimSummit before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia. Click here to see the full hearing:
Good to meet with @GavinNewsom and my California colleagues about the #WoolseyFire and other fires that that have affected California.
It was great to meet with the Director of Advocacy for @jworldwatch, Ms. Ann Strimov Durbin. This is a great organization that assists survivors of mass atrocities around the globe and seeks to inspire people of all faiths and cultures to join the fight against genocide.
I was pleased to meet with Mr. Kentaro Sonoura, Member of the Japanese Parliament. We discussed burden sharing, trade deficit, and U.S.-Japanese relations.
The hearing will preview the upcoming #TrumpKimSummit. I look forward to hearing from Governor Richardson and other witnesses on how we can begin to see tangible progress in our negotiations with North Korea. For more details, click here:
Pleased to announce that @GovRichardson, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and Governor of New Mexico, will testify before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia tomorrow, February 26th, at 10:15 AM EST.

I will be appearing on @OutFrontCNN on @CNN at 4:30 PM PST (7:30 EST) to discuss the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. #TrumpKimSummit
(3) MBS has stated point blank that he wants the option to develop a nuclear weapon. We cannot allow this to happen, and only the highest Congressional scrutiny will ensure that. I commend @RepCummings and the Oversight and Reform Committee for bringing attention to this issue.
(2) That needs to change. Next week, I will be reintroducing legislation with @marcorubio and @SenMarkey to require a vote in both houses to approve any nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia.
(1) New report sheds disturbing light on US efforts to push Saudi nuclear program. Right now, a nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia could go into force without Congressional approval.
We do have a national emergency: It's Donald Trump. #FakeTrumpEmergency
The murder of Sindhi activist Irshad Ranjhani in Karachi is heartbreaking and unacceptable. Arresting Rahim Shah is a good start, but I call on Pakistan to conduct a full and fair investigation so Ranjhani’s family receives the justice they deserve.
Hey @JeffBezos, @amazon ’s still welcome in LA
Glad to meet with M.R. Rangaswami and Sanjeev Joshipura of @IndiasporaForum, today. I learned that the Indian-American community has provided $1.2 billion to American institutions of higher learning over the past 18 years (only counting the largest contributions).
Pleased to join so many of my Democratic colleagues to co-sponsor the #GreenNewDeal. Global climate change is real, and it's time to address the issue in a serious way.
(3) We advanced this bill through the Judiciary Committee last night and will fight to bring this bill to the Floor in honor of the victims and families of #Parkland and every community devastated by gun violence.
(2) I was proud to co-sponsor the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019: bipartisan, commonsense legislation that represents the will of the American people.
(1) One year ago today, 14 children died in the #Parkland shooting. Since then, nearly 1,200 more children have lost their lives due to guns. We must follow the example set by the students of Parkland and turn our grief into action until all our children and communities are safe.
The group claiming responsibility for this attack, JeM, is based in Pakistan. Islamabad must do more to reign in terrorists groups that it harbors and (in some cases) supports.
My thoughts are with the victims of today’s terrorist attack in Jammu Kashmir. I strongly condemn this egregious act of terrorism. The US stands by India in confronting and defeating terrorism. #KashmirTerrorAttack #PulwamaAttack
I was honored to join the Michigan delegation in remembering my old friend John Dingell on the House floor tonight.
It was a pleasure to welcome Ambassador Santiago Cabanas Ansorena of Spain to Washington D.C. today to discuss the importance of U.S.-Spanish relations.
All Democrats voted for Motion to Recommit. Two Republicans voted “present.” 100 percent of anti-Israel votes cast by Republicans.
It was a pleasure meeting with Speaker Moon Hee-Sang and other members of the South Korean National Assembly. We discussed holding reunions between Americans and their family members in North Korea and the second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.
Last week, @seanhannity invited me on his show for tonight. We confirmed the appearance in writing. They had to cancel. Hope we can reschedule.
We lost another great congressman in Walter Jones. We remember the respect he showed his colleagues on both sides of the aisle, his efforts on behalf of veterans and military families, and the spirit of bipartisanship he embodied in his service to his constituents and country.

What Rep. Omar said was wrong. So is the cynical attempt by those claiming to be pro-Israel to say Rep. Omar speaks for the Democratic Party.
Israel’s worst enemies and its so-called “best friends” (like the Republican Jewish Coalition) are both trying to say “you can’t be a progressive Democrat and be pro-Israel.”
...Congress and the American people are pro-Israel because Israel deserves our support. I've been pro-Israel my entire life. I gave money to @AIPAC before I ran for office. They do great work and I look forward to speaking at their annual conference next month, for the 23rd time
I agree with Chairman @RepEliotEngel that “Anti-Semitism in any form is unacceptable, and it’s shocking to hear a Member of Congress invoke the anti-Semitic trope of ‘Jewish Money’”. Rep. Omar claims that Congress is pro-Israel because of AIPAC and contributions...
We lost a great and honorable man, former Representative John David Dingell Jr., who served in Congress for nearly six decades. John served this country with honor in wartime and with distinction as a legislator. May John's legacy guide us forward and serve as an inspiration.
In this era of the 10-minute news cycle, good politics "requires" immediate decisions. But good legislating has always required study and hard work --- and that can take a few days.
The #GreenNewDeal (H. Res. 109) may be the most wide-ranging and consequential measure put before the Congress in recent years. I look forward to analyzing it this weekend.
I met with Dr. Al-Issa, who heads the Muslim World League. I urged him to use his influence in the Muslim World to at least eliminate capital punishment for adultery, blasphemy, apostasy, or being in the LGBT community. The response was not as encouraging as you would like.

As the Co-Chair of the India Caucus and Chair of the House Asia Subcommittee, I had the pleasure of hosting Ambassador Shringla’s congressional welcome reception tonight.
@DZalkaliani, the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Georgia paid a visit to my office today. We discussed my support for H.R. 6219 the Georgian Support Act as well as US aid to Georgia, particularly in the Georgian region of #SamtskheJavakheti

Michael and his family have endured unimaginable pain during this ordeal. We must do all we can to ensure Michael’s release and safe return home.

I’ll be on @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews a bit after 9 pm PST to share my thoughts on the #StateOfTheUnion. I believe it is important for Democrats to appear on Fox, even though they rarely invite me and often cancel.
First #SOTU in history when a President began by demanding that Congress not investigate him.
.@WorldBank has lent $7.8 billion to China since 2016. If @realDonaldTrump wants to save money, he can end this practice. At a hearing in December, I questioned David Malpass, Trump’s nominee for World Bank President, who made good points.
I was proud to join my colleagues on a letter sent to Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan demanding he stop the implementation of #Trump’s ban on transgender patriots who wish to serve our country through military service. We must #ProtectTransTroops.

Appears the #President is misinformed when he claims on @FaceTheNation that we have 40,000 troops in South Korea. It's under 30,000.
My letter, found here lays out all the reasons. This is actually a win for the Russians, and we take the blame for killing yet another agreement.
#Trump’s decision to pull out of the INF now is another ill-advised decision by his administration. As Chairman of the House Subcommittee with jurisdiction over nonproliferation, I oppose this move and urged the administration not to take it.
I'm pleased to announce that a 15 day extension to register for assistance from @fema has been granted for those affected by the #WoolseyFire. Please follow this link for more information:
.@RepGwenMoore exemplified bravery and grace. Her story is just one example of why we must not relent in our fight to ensure that all Americans have coverage for preexisting conditions and have access to affordable and quality healthcare.
I also spoke at length with @HEBobiWine about the importance of democracy, respect for human rights and ensuring stability, not just in Uganda, but in the region as a whole. #PeoplePower
It was a pleasure to greet my friend @HEBobiWine and discuss pressing issues facing #Uganda and the greater region. We exchanged our concerns over Uganda’s role in military transfers to South Sudan and Uganda’s possible involvement in the DRC.
Good Move
It was a pleasure to meet with @SEC_News Chairman Clayton today. We discussed protecting investors. I laid out the many reasons, both legal and policy, why the SEC should not change its policy on shareholder class action lawsuits.
I strongly support the state of New York's efforts to call upon corporations to ensure their workforce is inclusive of people with disabilities. I met today with @CalPERS and discussed the importance of disability inclusion in their investments.
It was a pleasure to meet with the @VEDC_business to discuss strategies for providing support to small businesses in the Valley.
These incidents constitute a violation of the federal hate-crime statues and I will urge the @FBI to investigate and for federal prosecutors to prosecute to the full extent of the law.
I strongly condemn this hateful act of vandalism. It is particularly cruel to those whose family members died in the Armenian Genocide.
I have been informed that Turkish flags have been posted outside and inside of the Holy Martyrs Ferrahian High School, and other Armenian schools and churches in Southern California.
I hope to welcome Ambassador @HarshShringla to the Valley soon.
As the incoming co-chair of the India Caucus, it was great to meet with the new Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Mr. @HarshShringla. I’ve had the opportunity to meet with every Indian Ambassador during this century and have hosted 3 of the Ambassadors in the San Fernando Valley.
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we honor and remember the 6 million Jews who were murdered and commit ourselves to continuing the fight against bigotry, anti-semitism, and intolerance. #WeRemember
#Trump allows the government to open for 3 weeks. Let’s keep it open. And let’s pass Comprehensive Immigration Reform: border security and permanent relief for #Dreamers and millions of long-term U.S. residents who have not committed violent crimes.
It will be similar to the bill I introduced last Congress with @SenMarkey and @marcorubio.
That is why I will soon be introducing legislation to ensure Congress votes on any nuclear agreement with Saudi Arabia. The bill will deter Saudi Arabia from developing a nuclear weapon.
Saudi Arabia appears to have secretly built a ballistic missile production facility. This once again underscores the need to get strident restrictions on its proposed nuclear program.
.@TSA announced that they have found funding to provide employees with transit and parking benefits. @TSA employees deserve to be compensated with more than a consolation prize. Trump must stop jeopardizing our national security by holding federal wages hostage. #EndtheShutdown
The only one of the two bills that will reach Trump’s desk is the one to open government till February 8.  Will he dare veto it after it garners support of Senate Republicans? Not sure Mitch is making White House happy. Not sure he cares.
Good news! And a nod to mediator @MayorOfLA Eric Garcetti.
As a senior member of @FSCDems, I will be introducing legislation to prevent credit rating agencies from lowering the credit scores of federal employees and contractors if they can’t make payments during a government #shutdown and 60 days after the shutdown ends.
In Singapore, Trump capitulated to Kim Jong Un – handing North Korea a propaganda coup in exchange for empty words. During a second summit, he must deliver concrete, verifiable commitments from Pyongyang.

U.S. recognition of the #Rohingya genocide is long overdue. Today is the 70th anniversary of the @UN Convention against Genocide.
Pleasure to meet today with former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. We discussed defending Ukrainian democracy. That includes its territorial integrity and its elections.
At the same time, Trump has refused to impose sanctions on major Chinese banks that work with North Korea. He cancelled military exercises. We got little or nothing — so far.
Our highest priority must be to get North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile capabilities in return for some U.S. concessions, as part of a phased process of denuclearization, action-for-action.
The result of President Trump’s dithering on North Korea after the Singapore Summit is that Pyongyang is expanding its nuclear and missile capabilities, as revealed by @MIIS
