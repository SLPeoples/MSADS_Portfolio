Excited to announce the details for my upcoming town hall! We’ll be at the @delawareTech Owens campus in the auditorium on Wednesday March 20 7 p.m. The event is free and open to everyone – please register ahead of time at #ChrisCoonsTownHall
Today, #InternationalWomensDay is a chance to not only thank the women who make our communities, country, and world a better place, but also to re-commit to ensuring that women everywhere have the rights and opportunities they deserve.
I’m pleased to be working with a bipartisan group of my colleagues to enact a framework that will promote the stabilization of fragile environments where terrorists thrive, build peace, and maximize the impact of U.S. foreign assistance. Read more:
The United States has spent nearly $5.9 trillion in the 18 years since 9/11 in combatting extremism and terrorism around the world. This legislation is a genuinely bipartisan approach to prevent terrorism from taking hold in the first place.
The U.S. is a leader in responding to global humanitarian crises, yet lacks a long-term cohesive strategy for addressing the root causes of extremism instability that turn fragile states into failed states. Proud to introduce the bipartisan Global Fragility Act to address this.
I’m old enough to remember when Mexico was going to pay for the wall. 
Nearly 10 million kids in America live in poverty. The #AmericanFamilyAct will cut childhood poverty by nearly 40%

Thank you so much to the parents, teachers, industry partners and mentors who make the ACE Mentor Program of Delaware so successful and truly life changing.
Today, we’re calling on the Senate Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on universal background checks legislation. 97% of Americans support universal background checks - it’s time for the Senate to take this common sense legislation seriously.

Proud that Delaware’s Attorney General, Kathy Jennings, is suing the Trump Administration after it gutted the Title X program, which helps more than 19,000 Delawareans access cancer screenings, exams, and contraception.

There is no doubt that China’s unfair trade and currency practices have hurt American manufacturers, and I support the President’s desire to change China’s behavior and hold them accountable. President Trump’s haphazard trade war isn’t the way to do it, though.
Concerned by reports that Pres Trump sought to interfere with the Warner merger because he doesn’t like CNN. Regardless of your opinion on the merger, the Admin is supposed to look out for the best interests of the American people, not settle scores for the President.

Countries like Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea increasingly use their cyber capabilities to threaten the security and prosperity of the United States and our allies.
Every US company paying import tariffs on account of the China trade dispute should be able to apply for relief. So I’m introducing the bipartisan, bicameral Import Tax Relief Act with @SenatorLankford, @RepRonKind, and @RepWalorski to require just that.
China’s unlawful trade practices must end. We should pressure China, but not while recklessly harming US employers and consumers.
@SenatorLankford This bipartisan effort will ensure these organizations can continue to provide vital community services without undue burden.

Today, I’m joining my Senate Democratic colleagues in introducing a resolution that affirms 3 simple things:1. Climate change is real.2. It’s caused by humans.3. Congress must act.
I agree with President Trump that Michael Cohen is a liar a criminal.But so is Roger Stone. So is Paul Manafort. So is Michael Flynn. President Trump surrounded himself with criminals liars, but we're supposed to believe that neither he nor his campaign did anything illegal?
We don't need reality TV summits. We need real and serious diplomacy.
I'm also deeply disappointed that President Trump took Kim Jong Un's word that he did not murder Otto Warmbier, an innocent young American who died at the hands of the North Koreans.
I'm very concerned by reports that American negotiators had dropped a requirement that North Korea make a full and transparent accounting of its nuclear facilities.
While I’m grateful that President Trump walked away from a bad deal with North Korea, it seems that he wasn't well prepared for this summit.
Honored to earn 100% from the @LCVoters for my '18 environmental voting record. I’m proud to fight for climate action, clean energy, public lands, and more, here in DE across our country #LCVScorecard

That’s why I cosponsored the Child Care for Working Families Act, which will ensure parents have quality child care when they need it, expand access to preschool, and ensure teachers can support themselves and their families. #ChildCare4All
In the past decade, the cost of child care has increased by 25%. Many parents are forced to choose between paying for child care and leaving the workforce altogether as a result. This has to change.
I encourage President Trump to press for a complete accounting of all North Korean nuclear sites and facilities during this summit and to work in concert with our allies and international partners to press for verifiable, irreversible denuclearization.
Despite President Trump’s claims that North Korea no longer poses a nuclear threat and that Kim Jong Un is an honorable leader, there is no evidence that North Korea has taken any concrete steps to to denuclearize or improve their horrible human rights record.
While I’m pleased to see President Trump pursue diplomacy as he meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, I remain concerned that President Trump continues to downplay the threat that North Korea presents.
The Trump administration is refusing to release the facts about the killing of @washingtonpost journalist and US resident Jamal Khashoggi, so today, we’re introducing legislation to force them to publicly disclose what they know about his murder.

The President is not above the law. This interference with ongoing investigations is alarming and unacceptable. Now would be a good time to protect the special counsel.
I’m proud that Delaware’s Attorney General, Kathleen Jennings, is one of 16 state Attorneys General suing the Trump Administration over this misguided decision.
This funding, which should be supporting the construction of better housing, schools, medical facilities for servicemembers families, is threatened because the President refuses to listen to border security experts Republicans Democrats who agree a wall is a bad idea.
The President is planning to take money from the military and from drug interdiction programs to build his wall - that means funds for Dover Air Force Base, the Delaware National Guard, and law enforcement programs could be at risk.
President Trump’s emergency declaration is wrong, dangerous, and, I believe, unconstitutional. It could also impact us here in Delaware.
Our intelligence community is led by career professionals not partisan political folks. Their job is to gather actionable intelligence from around the world to make sure our President is able to make informed decisions on some of the most pressing security issues in front of us

For these reasons and more, I’m honored to join @SenJackReed and @SenBlumenthal on the Action for National Service Act, which will make it possible for young people to earn funds for higher education while participating in our national tradition of service.
National service is truly bipartisan. It’s something that engages and inspires young Americans. It delivers meaningful support and lasting change to communities that need it all across this country.
I saw the effects of public service and the AmeriCorps program firsthand when I worked with the I Have a Dream Foundation – I continue to be inspired by its impact in Delaware year in and year out.
Senators John McCain Ted Kennedy recognized what it means to live a life of service: Giving back to this nation, affirming our shared values, and holding up the idea of national service as an expectation of every American.
At the @Voices4Service Friends of National Service Awards this week, I spoke about service that builds, uplifts and engages, -- and is at the very heart of what it means to be Americans.

The President should reconsider this disaster declaration and work with Congress to ensure our approach to border security is driven by facts, not fear, and good policy, not politics.
Democrats Republicans agree border security is important, but the President’s fear mongering about immigrants, refusal to listen to border security experts about what our real needs are at the border, and his attempts to end run the appropriations process are counterproductive.
It is the responsibility of Pres. any President-to declare national emergencies when appropriate respond with the full resources of the federal government, but clearly, there is no such emergency for him to declare.
While I’m encouraged Pres. Trump will finally sign into law the bipartisan agreement to fund the government make robust investments in smart border security, his decision to declare a #NationalEmergency in order to build a wall along our southern border is a serious mistake.

And sometimes, even when it's difficult, it means joining hands in prayer or reflection to remind ourselves that as public servants, we share the same obligations to do what's best for the country we all love.

Sometimes, that means working together on bipartisan legislation.
