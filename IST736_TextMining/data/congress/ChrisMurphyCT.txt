9/ If this summit does result in a verifiable commitment from both sides to take step-by-step actions, on a specified timeline, I’ll be the first applaud it. But if Trump blunders negotiations and gives up the farm for a photo op with Kim, Congress will not stand idly by.
8/ North Korea has a history of pretending to comply in order to get what it wants. It would be a catastrophe for Trump to sign a peace agreement, promise to withdraw troops, and give up all leverage while North Korea retains the capability to annihilate us or our allies.
7/ Trump's own intelligence experts concluded that North Korea's nuclear weapons program continued throughout the last year and that they remain "committed to developing a long-range, nuclear-armed missile that is capable of posing a direct threat to the United States."
6/ We know that's a possibility because that's exactly what happened at last year's summit. Trump lavished praise on Kim and halted important joint military exercises, without any meaningful commitment to denuclearization in return.
5/ These are tangible steps North Korea could take to roll back its nuclear program that would merit corresponding commitments from the US and our allies. But the danger lies in Trump making big concessions to Kim without anything substantial in return.
4/ Permanent dismantlement of the nuclear facilities at Yongbyon, with international monitoring. And finally, a verifiable cap on North Korea’s nuclear warheads and delivery systems.
3/ Next, a freeze on all weapons of mass destruction activities. Not just pausing nuclear tests - halting all enrichment activities, construction of new nuclear facilities, building of new missiles, developmental testing, and chemical and biological weapons programs.
2/ First, a signed joint declaration detailing a roadmap for continued negotiations, w milestones for verifiable progress, including firm dates for completion. The declaration should include a clear definition of the ultimate goal—not just vague references to “denuclearization.”
1/ �THREAD: the fact that Trump wants a deal so bad and is such a terrible negotiator should scare us all heading into the summit with Kim. So here’s a rundown of what Trump should be asking for from the North Koreans if we want a good deal.
This isn't partisan. Republicans and Democrats agree that if you want to buy a gun, you should have to pass a background check.

Forgive me if I cast a tad of doubt on the humanitarian intentions of a President who locked little kids up in cages and tried to cut the State Dept by 40%. I draw issue w the method and bravado, not the aid. You can get food to Venezuela without inciting war.
In light of tonight's Venezuela thread, re-linking my longer piece with @brhodes. We argue that U.S. had legitimate interests in weakening Maduro. And we believe in democracy promotion in Venezuela. We just worry Trump is doing it very badly.
6/ And finally - and perhaps most importantly - go look up the 1947 Rio Treaty, It's a western hemisphere mutual defense treaty, and may not require a war declaration if Trump is legitimately coming to the defense of Colombia. Don't think the Venezuela hawks don't know this.
5/ Maduro is evil, and the U.S. should pursue a strategy to undermine him and prompt new elections. No one can defend what he has done to Venezuela. But it's quite a different thing for the U.S. to incite a civil war with no real plan for how it ends (sound familiar?).
4/ Senator Rubio rushed to tweet out reports today of Maduro allies firing into Colombian territory, warning that the "the United States WILL help Columbia confront any aggression against them." Venezuela ordered Colombian diplomats out in 24 hours, ramping up the crisis.
3/ I want aid to get to Venezuelans. But let's be honest - Venezuela didn't just lurch into humanitarian crisis. The aid is being sent there now as part of a regime change strategy. Many are hoping that it will be the match that lights a civil war against Maduro.
2/ First, so secret Trump has been talking up war with Maduro since 2017, when he repeatedly asked McMaster for a plan to overthrow Maduro. New McCabe book confirms Now, Trump says "all options are on the table" and Rubio objects to Senate resolution that forbids war.
1/ Democrats need to be careful about a potential trap being set by Trump et al in Venezuela. Cheering humanitarian convoys sounds like the right thing to do, but what if it's not about the aid? What if the real agenda is laying a pretext for war? Follow my logic for a second.
This NYT piece says plan is to "peacefully import foreign aid".  Not entirely true - some are using the aid to try to pick a fight. Article also says convoys are a "test" of Guaido's credibility. But he doesn't control anything - so what are we testing?
