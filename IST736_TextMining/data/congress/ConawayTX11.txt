@DanielShelton79 Hi Daniel, you can find my full statement here:
Anti-Semitism, racism, white supremacy, and hateful speech have no place in the House of Representatives. House Democrats must take bigotry of all kinds seriously, not just instances that fit their progressive liberal agenda.
RT @GOPLeader: It really shouldn't be so difficult for Democrats—or anyone for that matter—to stand up against anti-Semitism.
Ralph dedicated his life to service, and it was a pleasure working with him in Congress. Suzanne and I will be keeping his family and many friends in our prayers.
Russia, China, and other adversaries continue to pose serious and real national security threats. It's arrogant and foolish to think otherwise.
RT @TaxTimeAllies: Thank you to the offices of @GKButterfield @ConawayTX11 others who joined us, @ccianet, @prosperitynow, @ALALibrary
Even the @ACLU thinks #HR1 violates our constitutional right to free speech #NOTforthePeopleAct
Tax dollars should not serve as a campaign slush fund for politicians, which is why I am voting no on the Democrat Politician Protection Act #NOTforthePeopleAct #HR1
Heartbreaking news in Midland today. Please join me in prayer for this fallen officer’s family and loved ones. God bless our men and women in blue �
Hey @timkmak — meet Gatsby! He keeps an eye on our office when not distracted by tennis balls, treats, and new friends. Come by and say hi!
Always a pleasure catching up with my good friend @SecretarySonny. Thanks for the pic, @USDA!
And @SpeakerPelosi won't even allow a vote to be held in the House. It's unfathomable that Democrats are okay with children being murdered after they are brought into this world

.@realDonaldTrump: "Let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God." I couldn't agree more, Mr. President
For years, China has employed illegal trade practices that have driven jobs out of America and hurt our workers. The President is right – we must protect our workers by making fair trade a priority #SOTU
We cannot settle for anything less than full operational control of our borders. It is imperative that we provide our border security agents with the tools necessary to succeed: a physical barrier, more agents, and better technology
Knowing who and what is coming across our borders is essential to the safety and security of our nation. Congress must work with the President to pass legislation that will fully secure our borders #SOTU
Our country is now the worldwide leader in oil and natural gas production, in large part thanks to the Permian Basin #SOTU #AmericanEnergy
RT @WhiteHouse: More people are working now than at any time in the history of our country—157 million people at work.
It's unfathomable that in this day and age, some government officials need a reminder that infanticide is illegal and morally reprehensible.
Let’s help Jury out – how many farmers out there have a patch? �‍️ #AgTwitter #FutureFarmers
The Chinese government’s objective is to drive American companies out of business and move their technology and jobs to China at any cost, including IP theft and illegal trade practices.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy of forgiveness, love, and justice, has forever impacted our nation’s history and people across the world. May his life continue to be celebrated while his martyrdom never forgotten.
My wife Suzanne and I’s thoughts, prayers, and deepest condolences are with the family and loved ones of this brave Texan who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country. May God stretch out his healing hand during this time of heart break.
