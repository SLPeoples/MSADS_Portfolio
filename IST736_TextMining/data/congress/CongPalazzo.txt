For the People? No, this one is #ForThePoliticians #HR1
It's nothing more than a partisan fueled bill to grow Democratic piggy banks that was written by outside groups to ensure the limitation of your right to free speech.
This bill sets a disturbing precedence by using your tax dollars to fund political campaigns - even if you don't agree with the candidate. It strips local oversight of elections and hands it to DC bureaucrats. It is an unconstitutional attack on your First Amendment rights.

RT @ICEgov: Underestimating the potential danger of human smuggling can have a deadly outcome
I joined @YahooFinance this morning with @AlexisTVNews and discussed the needs of those on the front line of our southern border.
Glad I could join @GrayDCnews to discuss securing our border and my most recent trip to our ports of entry and existing wall barriers. Our border security plan is a system of defenses to keep people from entering our country illegally. #SecureTheBorder #BorderNegotiations
As a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Committee, I will continue to advocate for increased border security and ensure that we are doing everything in our power to address the humanitarian and security crisis that we are currently facing.
Investing in smart, high tech resources will only improve the long-term oversight of who and what are coming through the border.
We need to provide more technology to be used along the border. We know that most of the drugs streaming into our country are coming through our ports of entry. It's time that we provide those checkpoints with innovative technology to decrease illegal flows of drugs weapons.
With additional migrant caravans heading our way, we need more boots on the ground actively monitoring all suspicious activity. While at the border, I was taken aback by the professionalism commitment of those already working to secure the border.
Our goal should be to improve the existing barriers, and implement new physical barriers where they are needed.
Where we already have walls, we've seen dramatic decreases in illegal border crossings. In both Yuma and San Diego, where walls have been built, illegal border crossings have dropped 95%, helping our CBP agents to focus their efforts on other parts of their enforcement strategy.
I returned to DC this week after taking a trip to the border to inspect existing walls, meet with @CBP @ICEgov experts, and learn about our ports of entry. I walked away w/3 major takeaways.1) we need a wall2) we need more personnel3) we need more tech
