Democrats today seek to weaponize our voting system with HR 1 the #PoliticianProtectionAct.This weakens the voting system of American people by increasing election system’s vulnerability failing to implement necessary checks and balances regarding who is registering to vote.
HR 1 which amounts to the #PoliticianProtectionAct disregards state #voteridentification laws by     allowing sworn statements to be used in place of identification allowing for signature verification, which can be submitted through a photo if the voter registers online.
HR 1 is better named #PoliticianProtectionAct creating a 6:1 government match to any small donor contributions of $200 or less in congressional/presidential campaigns new voucher pilot program that grants eligible voters $25 in #taxpayer money to donate to anybcampaign #BadBill
HR 1 #PoliticianProtectionAct violates constitutional rights  under 1st Amendment by expanding definition of political speech increases power of federal government to control it. Changes the makeup of FEC giving democrats ability to silence speech with which they disagree.

I couldn’t agree more: @realDonaldTrump “It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.  This is wrong, unfair, and together we will stop it.” #SOTU
.@realDonaldTrump “Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.” #SOTU
