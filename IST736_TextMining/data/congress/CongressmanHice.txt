The House has yet again come together to denounce hatred – in all forms – following @IlhanMN's most recent intolerant comments. It’s concerning that Democrats are rushing to support Omar and explain away her repeated, shameful rhetoric. Where’s the leadership, @SpeakerPelosi?
The provisions in #HR1 simply fly in the face of logic, and I will stand strong against this blatant federal overreach and urge my @HouseGOP and @HouseDemocrats colleagues to do the same.
The automatic voter registration provision in #HR1 would lead to huge numbers of illegal immigrants and non-citizens being registered to vote - unless those aliens proactively decline. Do we really believe that folks here illegally are going to admit they're here illegally?
Under #HR1, 6-to-1 public financing for congressional candidates means millions of federal dollars will go toward congressional candidates and campaign consultants. The American people don't want more of their hard-earned money going to politicians.
.@HouseDemocrats claim #HR1 is about greater voter participation, increased election security, and more ethics accountability, but the sales pitch and the reality are two very different things. What's really in H.R. 1?
I spoke on the @HouseFloor today about the many problems with #HR1. For one, the @OfficeGovEthics should be an education prevention agency, but is openly partisan. The last thing they need is subpoena authority to open the door to overt harassment of our Executive Branch.

Border security shouldn’t be controversial. Without a secure border, the safety and security of every American is at risk. Folks have long supported a physical barrier because #WallsWork. It’s time for Democrats to come to the table, end the gridlock, and #SecureOurBorders. #SOTU
While Democrats cast blame and obstruct progress, President @realDonaldTrump stands for the victims of our porous borders, like the Angel Families of those killed by illegal immigrants.  #SOTU
4,000 violent killings by illegal aliens is not a "manufactured crisis." Neither are the 30,000 sex crimes and 100,000 assaults committed by criminal aliens over the past two years. We're in the middle of a border crisis, and it's time to take action. #BuildTheWall #SOTU
As President @realDonaldTrump has said before, folks "don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside."

Better roads are coming our way! Last week, the @USDOT awarded Georgia a $24.8 million BUILD grant to assist with highway improvements in Barrow Co., including the widening of Highway 316 as we continue to build along this critical corridor.
On Saturday, one of my Service Academy nominees, Anna Jerald, had the opportunity to meet and speak with @SecPompeo during the 119th #ArmyNavyGame. Now a “yearling” at @WestPoint_USMA, her drive and motivation to serve our Nation are making us proud. Keep it up, Anna! #GA10
President Bush was a remarkable leader who led a life of duty, purpose, and conviction. It was amazing to see our country come together last week to mourn his legacy of leadership, love of country, and dedication to family. Read more in my e-newsletter →
Just spoke on the @HouseFloor in support of my bill, H.R. 6108, the Preserving America’s Battlefields Act, a bill to reauthorize a successful dollar-for-dollar grants program that promotes the preservation of historic battlefields like Kettle Creek in Wilkes County. #GA10
In celebration of National Bible Week, I proudly spoke on the House Floor last week about the impact of faith on my daily life as a pastor, a citizen, and a policymaker. Listen to my remarks below.

One year ago, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump announced that the U.S. officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Today, I’m proud to celebrate the anniversary, and I look forward to continuing to strengthen the enduring ties between our two

Dee Dee and I send our deepest condolences to the Bush family and to all of those mourning our beloved 41st President. Godspeed, H.W. #Bush41
We mourn the loss of a great American and will long remember his life of service and the legacy he leaves behind. Undoubtedly, his example will continue to inspire all Americans to serve a greater cause.
With President George H.W. Bush’s passing, we have lost one of the all-time greats, an incomparable and irreplaceable public servant whose dedication and grace embodied duty, honor, and country.
Calling all Dawgs – it’s time to come together to talk football, not politics. #GoDawgs #BeatBama
On behalf of #GA10, thank you, Mr. Chairman @TGowdySC. Thank you for your service to our country and your powerful voice on @GOPoversight and other committees on which you’ve served. The gap you leave will be enormously huge and extremely difficult – if not impossible – to fill.

Heavy hearts in Georgia as we mourn the passing of Mac Collins, who served our State with great passion and dedication. Dee Dee and my prayers are with the entire Collins family during this incredibly difficult time. He will be sorely missed by all.

Guided by our shared values, I look forward to building on past successes, seizing unique opportunities, and taking on new challenges as we work to build a better future for our children and grandchildren. More in my weekly newsletter→
Regardless of who's in charge, my commitment to ensuring #GA10 keeps more of their hard-earned money with less government interference in their lives will never change. The priorities of our community will always be my central concern I’m honored to be your voice in Washington.
During yesterday’s veterans celebration, I heard from a #GA10 hero who had been having difficulties getting medical bills paid by the Atlanta VAMC, and I was overjoyed to learn how #TeamHice went to bat to help him receive the benefits he'd earned.

Our servicemembers should be celebrated every day, but today – #VeteransDay – is an especially important time to take an extra few minutes to share our thanks for our veterans and heroes.
