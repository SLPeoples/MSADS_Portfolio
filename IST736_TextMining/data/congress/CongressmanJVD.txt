Check out today’s House Committee on Natural Resources: Democrats hearing on the “Threats to the North Atlantic Right Whale.” #ACEPA. #NoSeimic #ProtectOurCoast #BlocktheBlast
I have introduced HR 11149, the bipartisan Atlantic Coastal Economies Protection Act, which would prohibit seismic airgun blasting in the Atlantic, to protect marine life and our coastal economy. #ACEPA. #NoSeimic #ProtectOurCoast #BlocktheBlast
Seismic airgun blasting can also lead to declines in catch rates by as much as 80 percent for some fish species. #ACEPA. #NoSeimic #ProtectOurCoast #BlocktheBlast
Seismic airgun blasting for oil and gas can disturb, injure, or kill marine life, including the endangered North Atlantic Right Whale, one of God’s most majestic creatures. #ACEPA. #NoSeimic #ProtectOurCoast #BlocktheBlast
My bill will help protect consumers by ensuring that robocallers and scammers are prosecuted to the full extent of the law. #NoRobo
Which is why I have introduced the Robocall Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2019 to crack down on abusive, annoying, and illegal robocalls. #NoRobo
Data shows that New Jersey residents reported 321,393 robocall complaints last year alone - more than any other state in the nation. #NoRobo
Over the years, countless people throughout South Jersey have shared with me that they are constantly harassed by robocalls and scams. #NoRobo

Offshore drilling and its predecessor seismic airgun blasting are detrimental to our environment, wildlife, and economies. That is why it is so important that we garner support for H.R. 1149 #ACEPA. #NoSeimic #ProtectOurCoast #BlocktheBlast

I had the opportunity to tour the military tech hub of South Jersey including the William J. Hughes Tech Center. This hub is essential to our national security, it is imperative to ensure that these critical ops never get interrupted again.
Over the years, New Jersey has been the recipient of more than $357 million in #LWCF funding, protecting places such as the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area and the Supawna Meadows, Cape May and Edwin Forsythe National Wildlife Refuges. #SaveLWCF #PublicLands
The bill reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund #LWCF which uses non-taxpayer dollars to create parks and protect special places with ecological, cultural and historical significance. #SaveLWCF #PublicLands
Today, the U.S. Congress passed a historic bipartisan bill, the Natural Resources Management Act, to protect our #PublicLands for future generations and ensure recreational access for hunting, fishing and other outdoor activities. #LWCF #SaveLWCF

I believe that the United States has a moral and economic imperative to mitigate the impacts of climate change. However, I do not think that H.J. Res. 109, the #GreenNewDeal is the right solution.Read my statement to find out why.
I believe that climate change is real, is driven mainly by human activity and that it is driving real-world changes such as extreme weather events, hotter temperatures, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification. #GreenNewDeal
I am very pleased with the benefits that this bipartisan funding agreement will have for South Jersey. Check out the details about the funding for the William J. Hughes @FAATechCenter and employee raises! #Bipartisanship #FundingAgreement #Budget2019 #SouthJersey @FAANews

I fought to protect South Jersey's coastal economy and environment while in NJ State legislature and will continue to do so in Congress. #ProtectOurCoast #NoSeismic #ACEPA #BlocktheBlast #SouthJersey @oceana
South Jersey's local economy is dependent on fishing, tourism and wildlife watching – the bottom line is offshore oil and gas drilling isn’t worth the risk. -JVD #ProtectOurCoast #NoSeismic #ACEPA #BlocktheBlast #SouthJersey @oceana
Seismic air gun testing is the first step towards offshore oil and gas exploration and development and a direct threat to the coastal fishing and tourism economies dependent on healthy ocean ecosystems. #ProtectOurCoast #NoSeismic #ACEPA #BlocktheBlast @oceana
My colleague @RepRutherfordFL and I have introduced the bipartisan Atlantic Coastal Economies Protection Act #ACEPA to prohibit or stop seismic air gun testing in the Atlantic Ocean. #ProtectOurCoast #NoSeismic #BlocktheBlast @oceana

Today, the majority of my New Jersey colleagues and I came together to express our concern with the continued closure of the Atlantic City Rail Line. @NJTRANSIT's failure to meet its own deadlines and lack of transparency is unacceptable. #ACRailLine #AtlanticCity #NJPols
That’s why a majority of my New Jersey colleagues and I are sending a letter of admonishment to @NJTRANSIT. #NJTransit #atlanticcity #SouthJersey #ACRailLine
I will continue to put pressure on @NJTRANSIT, to tell the truth to the people of #SouthJersey about and fix the #ACRailLine. I won't stop until we get resolution on this issue. #NJTransit #atlanticcity
I have repeatedly tried to get answers from the Executive Director of @NJTRANSIT but have been continuously stonewalled. #NJTransit #atlanticcity #ACRailLine #SouthJersey
On Thursday I addressed the House floor to put pressure on @NJTRANSIT, to tell the truth to the people of South Jersey about the AC Rail Line after they promised it would be finished by early 2019, but recently announced it would take up to 5 more months.
@NJTRANSIT promised the public back in September that the project would be finished by early 2019, but recently, it announced that the A.C. Rail Line would be closed for up to 5 more months. #NJTransit #atlanticcity

The closure of the Atlantic City Rail line by @NJTRANSIT is affecting so many throughout South Jersey and these delays are unacceptable.
The failure of @NJTRANSIT on the AC Rail line is disturbing. I caught up with some people today in the halls of Congress to talk about this failure and how I am going to fight my hardest to get it straightened out. #NewJersey #AtlanticCity #SouthJersey
This morning on the house floor I addressed Members of Congress about the need to restore faith in our institution and prevent future shutdowns.
I have fought to protect the lifeblood of the local economy - tourism, fisheries, and wildlife-viewing – by banning offshore oil and gas drilling at the state level, and I will continue to do so at the federal level.
I am proud to be appointed to be the House Committee on Natural Resources. South Jersey is rich with natural resources, and in the 2nd Congressional District, the coastal economy and our commercial and recreational fisheries are a large part of life.

I am willing to talk immigration. I am willing to talk border security. I am willing to talk about whatever it takes to open the government and get the American people working again. I am not saying this to create division. I am saying this to create unity as Americans. – JVD
@aj_mirabelle This was in reference to the bill I proposed to fund our Coast Guard. As in be a good American and fund our Coast Guard.
"It's more important, not to be a good Republican or to be a good Democrat, but to be a good American." - Jeff Van Drew
It is unacceptable for the men and women who protect us to be treated like second class citizens over partisan bickering. We need to re-open our government. We need to separate these issues.
I am urging my fellow Congresspeople to support our Coast Guard and support our funding. #PayOurCoastGuardAct
The Coast Guard Training Center and FAA William J Hughes Technical Center are two of South Jersey's biggest employers.
In South Jersey alone, more than 1,500 brave men and women in the Coast Guard have been affected by the shutdown. The number approaches 1 million Coast Guard members and federal workers nationwide. #PayOurCoastGuardAct
Today I addressed the House floor to gain support for the "Pay Our Coast Guard Act" and legislation to fund the FAA during the government shutdown. #PayOurCoastGuardAct
I will be addressing the house floor today around 12 PM EST to urge members to immediately bring my bill H.R.350 the "Fund Our Coast Guard Act" to vote. You can watch the house floor live here: #PayTheCoastGuard
Today I met with Master Chief Jason M. Vanderhaden and Admiral Karl Schultz to discuss the shutdown and its effects on the Coast Guard as well as the legislation I introduced to fund the Coast Guard during the shutdown.
It is essential to our nations safety and security and the well-being of many families in South Jersey and across the United States. #FAA #CoastGuard #StopTheShutdown
I wrote a letter to @SpeakerPelosi and @senatemajldr urging them to support the Coast Guard and Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) by supporting the bills I introduced to re-open them. #CoastGuard #FAA
We must come together to end it. #GovtShutdown #NJ02
South Jersey needs the folks at our Coast Guard Training Center in Cape May, the Coast Guard Air Station in AC, and the FAA's William J. Hughes Technical Center in EHT to get back to work for the safety and security of our nation. #CoastGuard #FAA #GovtShutdown #NJ02
We need to separate these issues. We can address the border crisis without this shutdown and the distressing effects it is having on South Jersey and the United States of America.
It is unacceptable for the men and women who protect us to be treated like second class citizens over partisan bickering. We need to re-open our government. This is shameful.
In my first full week as a Congressman, I introduced legislation to fund the Coast Guard and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) during the Government shutdown.
Democrat or Republican, we are all Americans.
