Happy #WomensHistoryMonth! Last week, I stood shoulder to shoulder with my colleagues and kicked off this historic month by demanding #NoGagRule because we must keep fighting for equality and social justice for all.
Then again, if the story is true, why did the President lie about it in the first place unless he knew he shouldn’t have done it?
There must be no place for hate in America, whether it be Islamophobia,       Antisemitism, or any other bigotry.
To answer the President's attack on immigrant Members of Congress - "How did they do in their country?...Not too good" - I'm told that during my 3 months as an infant in India, I did just fine. I'd also add that the United States of America is my country just as much as it's his.
My family came to the United States to continue my father's education and because my parents knew what was possible here, even if they never dreamed their son would serve in Congress. That is the promise of our country: hope and possibility. Our mission should be expanding both.
I am a Member of Congress, I am an immigrant, and I am an American who loves his country deeply. My colleagues with similar backgrounds have their own stories, whether they came to our country as children, adults, or even as a refugee, but we share a devotion to our country.
That’s a problem, because the opinion of the National Security Advisor *should* matter if his title is in any way descriptive or the Administration is in any way functional.

I’m glad he went against his general record on the issue of criminal justice reform but I think it’s pretty clear what this President’s intuitive approach to issues of criminal justice and due process is.
And he’s the same President who took out an ad in the NY Times calling for the execution of the Central Park 5 and refused to accept they’d been wrongfully convicted, even after the verdict was vacated with DNA evidence. John McCain denounced his comments on the five in 2016.

To better understand Lincoln, the Civil War, Reconstruction, the history of race in America, and the nature of America itself, everyone should read more of Frederick Douglass. Black History Month is as good a time to start as any, but that's because it's always a good time. 6/6
In that 1876 speech, Douglass also wrestled at length with the complex balance of Lincoln's personal prejudices and the seeds of enlightenment along with the profound impact of Lincoln's public actions and their shortcomings. 5/6
Douglass said of Lincoln, "He was ready and willing at any time during the first years of his administration to deny, postpone, and sacrifice the rights of humanity in the colored people to promote the welfare of the white people of this country." 4/6
Douglass' "Oration in Memory of Abraham Lincoln" which he delivered on April 14, 1876 in Washington similarly touches on this balance of Lincoln's personal and public views on race and the complicated blending of the two
For example, Douglass' interactions with Lincoln over the role and treatment of black troops in the Civil War were revealing in his warm treatment of Douglass and sincere support for the regiments of black troops, but the limitations of that support 2/6
Frederick Douglass' writings on Lincoln are particularly fascinating in this regard because he addresses both aspects in Lincoln, a man he came to respect and love, who never went as far or as fast as Douglass wished but whose efforts he didn't diminish despite disappointment 1/6
A very helpful, disturbing, thread from an expert on nuclear strategy, and the catastrophic dangers it presents. Read it.
