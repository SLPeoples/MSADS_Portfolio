The #TrumpShutdown is now in effect. Sadly, American workers are the ones suffering because of Trump’s egotistical, politically-motivated temper tantrum.My full reaction:
Congrats to my Legislative Director her new fiancé on their Capitol engagement!
Secretary Mattis has held strong — even amidst President Trump’s erratic whims. It’s disappointing to see him go. This is a sad, scary day for our national security.(Worth reading his full resignation letter.)
Shame on the House GOP for voting to shut down our government over President Trump’s wasteful, ineffective wall. #TrumpShutdown We need a real plan to secure our nation’s borders reform our immigration system — not a politically-motivated temper tantrum on a misguided wall.
Special thanks to @CoryBooker @RepJeffries for their leadership. Looking forward to working with both of you even more to make our criminal justice system fair effective.
