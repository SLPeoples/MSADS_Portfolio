I commend .@GovRonDeSantis for his commitment to keeping the Sunshine State on the right track and I look forward to working with his administration to continue to improve the economy and address the issues that face our great state.
He also made it clear that Florida will never be a sanctuary state and promised that his administration would crack down on sanctuary cities. It’s great to hear that the safety of our citizens is a top priority.
.@GovRonDeSantis laid out a bold vision for Florida in his State of the State today. He reaffirmed his support for those in North Florida recovering from Hurricane Michael and vowed to work with local, state, and federal entities to rebuild our devastated communities.

This bill falls short of providing necessary funding to secure our borders and is forcing @POTUS to declare a national emergency to get the job done. I believe we can and must do better. 6/6
Furthermore, Democrats promised they would work with @realDonaldTrump to address border security - a promise they did not keep. 5/6
Florida’s Panhandle needs help now, not six months down the road. It’s been 4 months since Hurricane Michael hit much of the Panhandle is still in ruins, with people living in tents surviving on the bare essentials. We need to pass disaster funding we need to do it now. 4/6
I cannot in good conscience support a bill that completely ignores all those who were devastated by disasters in 2018. We cannot continue to kick the can down the road on disaster funding. 3/6
It includes no money for Hurricane Michael disaster relief, does not seriously address the humanitarian crisis at our border, was finalized at the last minute with little time for members to review the details. 2/6

It’s the beginning of a long expensive commitment to those in the Panhandle, but it is a step in the right direction. My vote today was for all those back home whose lives were forever changed in October – I have not forgotten you I will fight to ensure you are taken care of.
Hurricane Michael destroyed communities, decimated the agriculture industry, and left a path of destruction on our military bases in the Second District. This supplemental disaster funding is a down payment on getting the hardworking folks in my district back on their feet.
Tonight I voted to fund the government and fund disaster relief, while securing our border. President Trump is a man of his word. I commend him for remaining steadfast in ensuring our border is secure and those who were devastated by disasters this year are not forgotten.
I will continue to fight for disaster relief funding in the coming months and years because the survivors of Hurricane Michael across the south deserve nothing less. #HurricaneMichael
