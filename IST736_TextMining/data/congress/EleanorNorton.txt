I’ll be with @AlexWitt on @MSNBC soon. We have much to talk about from the District! Tune in.
Once upon a time ... not so long ago.#InternationalWomensDay
HISTORY Making Day: With the passage of #HR1, the US House of Representatives today officially endorsed #DCstatehood for the first time in American history.This vote sets the stage for consideration of HR 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act, which already has 200 cosponsors.
Took seven votes today on the House floor, the most yet. Many more to go to make up for 218 years without a vote.
Just asked Drug Czar why the Trump Admin though it appropriate to have an inexperienced 24 year old as Deputy Chief of Staff in the midst of a drug crisis and why there’s no national plan to combat the overdose epidemic.
Thank you @SenSchumer for naming #DCstatehood among the Senate’s top voting rights priorities!
I spoke on the House floor on the extensive findings supporting #DCstatehood in HR 1, the Democrats’ comprehensive bill to expand democracy in the US. Expect passage. Lays the precedent for the coming historic vote on DC statehood itself!
About to go on the House floor to speak in support of H.R. 1. If passed, the House of Representatives will have endorsed #DCstatehood for the first time in our history. #FreeAndEqualDC
I enjoyed speaking at the Bellevue Neighborhood Civic Association for #WomensHistoryMonth and your excellent questions. Congratulations to the women and men you honored!
Anti-democracy Members aren’t slowing our march to #DCstatehood. The @RepMarkMeadows-@RepGosar amendment against statehood and home rule got crushed by the Rules Committee last night. #FreeAndEqualDC
New historic milestone! We have secured 200 cosponsors for my bill, HR 51, to make D.C. a state. #DCstatehood continues to build momentum in Congress and won’t stop until the 700,000 taxpaying residents of DC have equal representation in their government. #FreeAndEqualDC
.@RepMarkMeadows and @RepGosar filed an amendment attacking #DCstatehood and DC home rule saying Congress should exercise even more oversight of DC. The 700,000 taxpaying citizens in DC think otherwise. I will do everything I can to defeat this amendment. #FreeAndEqualDC
The Center for Effective Lawmaking just ranked my service as the most effective House Democrat last Congress. Imagine what we could accomplish with equal representation to other states!
Yesterday, my bill requiring the Library of Congress to install the DC seal in the Thomas Jefferson building passed the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.DC should be equal in all respects with the states — that includes in the Library of Congress. #FreeAndEqualDC
Right now I’m leading a special hour on the House floor urging #DCStatehood. Yesterday, a record number of D.C. residents demanded Congress recognize their citizenship. Now, HR 51 (the D.C. Admission Act) has 198 cosponsors and we have strong momentum!
It is outrageous that only the President can grant clemency for local DC offenses.DC writes its own laws and alone should grant clemency from those laws, like states and territories. My bill gives DC that authority. #FreeAndEqualDC
Breaking News: Historic vote on #DCStatehood next week. House expected to pass HR 1, the For The People Act of 2019, which endorses DC statehood. Neither chamber has ever voted to endorse DC statehood. The momentum is building for a floor vote on HR 51, my DC statehood bill.
Going on @AC360 at 8 tonight to talk about my committee’s hearing tomorrow with former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.  Cohen will tell us what we do not know about Trump actions that could have influenced campaign.
Success.  My bill to allow DC, @NatlParkService and private sector to work together to fund and rehabilitate NPS parks is headed to the President’s desk for signature, after the House passed it today.  Franklin Park will be up first.
Speaking on House floor shortly on lands package that will help us renovate our local @NatlParkService parks.
During #DCStatehood Week, we are proud we now have as many cosponsors on our statehood bill as there are Republicans in Congress: 197, or 87% of the House Democratic Caucus. More signing on daily. See my House Floor speech on statehood today:
Pending #DCStatehood, we will fight for a #FreeAndEqualDC by all means necessary.  My bill to place DC’s seal alongside the state seals in the Library of Congress will be marked up tomorrow.
Thank you Maryland General Assembly Delegate Gabriel Acevero for your leadership in securing a hearing today on a resolution calling for #DCStatehood!
Expect final passage next week of my bill to allow DC and @NatlParkService to work together to fund and rehabilitate NPS parks in DC. Franklin Park will be first.
See my @washingtonpost letter to the editor responding to @ChuckLane1’s endorsement of retroceding DC to Maryland. My #DCStatehood bill, with a record 197 cosponsors, is the only way to make DC free and equal. 
Just spoke with my good friend Rep. Lacy Clay about his inquiry on the DC lottery contract. I appreciate he is not pursuing the inquiry. Rep. Clay is an original cosponsor of my #DCStatehood bill and supports home rule. #HandsOffDC

Challenging Trump’s fake emergency as an original cosponsor of @JoaquinCastrotx’s resolution to terminate the emergency declaration for a border wall. This declaration is an abuse of power, violates democratic norms and is unlawful. Congress must stop Trump’s slide into tyranny.
School is out, DC kids, but my bill permitting sledding on that hill at the Capitol is still in. Enjoy!
On the cusp of getting a House floor vote on #DCStatehood, @ChuckLane1 endorses the old saw of retrocession to Maryland.  Double trouble: to win votes from Congress and from Maryland, where no officials endorse retrocession. 
Congress rejected the wall and Trump signed the bill. Trump’s trumped up emergency does not go around Congress. It goes around the Constitution. #stop Tfrump’s coup.
If Congress lets Trump call national emergencies when we won’t concede on issues like a wall, we should just hand him our vote cards and go home. #stopTrumptakeover
All workers harmed by the #TrumpShutdown deserve to be fully compensated. Trump’s intervention to block back pay for federal contract workers, despite bipartisan support, showed no regard for fairness. We must address back pay for federal contract workers.
No credit score penalty for #TrumpShutdown. I wrote credit reporting agencies urging they disregard missed payments by furloughed federal employees and contract workers due to the #Shutdown when calculating credit scores.
I supported the House vote this week to remove US troops from Yemen.  Yet DC had no vote on this matter of war and peace, even though DC residents fund, fight and die in wars.  DC deserves a vote on wars and all other matters.  My #DCStatehood bill would fix this injustice.
Good news for DC - Final FY 19 DC spending bill contains $40 million for DCTAG for the 4th consecutive year and no new anti-home-rule riders!  Now that we have a Democratic House, we will redouble our efforts to remove the remaining two riders in FY 20.
The #PaycheckFairness Act is a much-needed update to strengthen the Equal Pay Act, which I enforced as the first woman to chair the @USEEOC. #EqualPay #HR7
This morning at 10:15am, I'm testifying at an @EdLaborCmte hearing on the #PaycheckFairness Act, which contains my provision to prohibit employers from asking job applicants their salary history, a critical step to closing the gender wage gap. #EqualPay
Pleased to announce that the Senate just passed my bill to allow the District to work with NPS to make improvements to NPS-owned parks in DC! Critically important since NPS owns most of DC's neighborhood parks. Working for the House to quickly follow suit.
RT @AFGENational: “Just keep on fighting until we win!” - @EleanorNorton #OurVoice2019 #1u
We hold public officials to a higher standard than ordinary citizens for a reason – they must have the confidence and trust of the people in order to effectively govern. Both Justin Fairfax and Ralph Northam have lost the ability to successfully govern and therefore must resign.
I introduced a bill to give DC's mayor local authority over DC's National Guard, the same authority enjoyed by governors of states and territories. DC's mayor has the best knowledge about when to deploy the Guard for local purposes. #FreeAndEqualDC
Today, with great sadness, we lost a legend in Frank Robinson, a pathbreaking Hall of Famer, @MLB’s first African American manager, and the first manager of our Washington @Nationals.
Here’s one way Congress can strengthen U.S. democracy: pass our #DCStatehood bill and give the 700,000 taxpaying residents of the nation’s capital full voting rights and self-government. #HR51
The bill is passed! Grateful for the bipartisan support for our Fairness for Breastfeeding Mothers Act. I look forward to working with our friends in the Senate to enact it into law.
Federal agencies encourage breastfeeding, and the ACA amended federal law to require employers to provide a space for returning employees to pump breastmilk for their newborns. My bill would extend this requirement to visitors and guests to federal facilities across the nation.
I'll be on the House floor at 12:15pm to manage a series of bills, including my bipartisan bill to require federal buildings to provide private and hygienic lactation spaces for nursing mothers. Watch live here:

Ralph Northam will enhance his notable service as governor if he puts his state before himself, resigns now, and allows the people of Virginia to heal and move forward with Justin Fairfax as governor.

Federal employees don’t work as “Democrats” or “Republicans,” but as civil servants serving our nation. Trump’s needless shutdown is hurting hundreds of  thousands of Americans and the hardworking federal employees who serve them. #TrumpShutdown
Federal employees don’t deserve this #TrumpShutdown, but be assured that some of us in Congress are already at work to make sure all our federal employees will be made whole with back pay.
#MerryChristmas DC! Wishing you and your family a peaceful and joy-filled day.�
