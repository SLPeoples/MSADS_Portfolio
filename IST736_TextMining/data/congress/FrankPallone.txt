Check out my Facebook live Q A from today:
It’s time to put an end to the #CultureOfCorruption in Trump’s @HouseGOP's Washington. The first step to making it happen? Passing the #ForThePeople Act. #HR1. Proud to stand with my Democratic colleagues in voting to bring transparency accountability back to our government.
The US Gov maintains an outdated, self-imposed ban on engagement with #Artsakh b/c of pressure from Azerbaijan. The Artsakh Travel Communications Resolution I introduced urges US to finally recognize Artsakh encourage more direct US-Artsakh cooperation.
It’s time to give power back to the people – I’m proud to co-sponsor the #SaveTheNet Act.
This #InternationalWomensDay we celebrate women who fight for their rights, the rights of others those who resist inequality oppression. Today we must recommit to gender equality, equal pay access to quality reproductive healthcare for women in the US around the globe.
Republicans have spent the last two years rewarding wealthy donors and special interests while leaving American families behind. That must end now. Today Democrats will pass #HR1 – a once-in-a-generation reform bill to clean up Washington once and for all.
We must have a fair, equitable, and accurate #2020Census. Looking forward to @RepCummings and House Oversight hearing to get to the bottom of what happened with this unconstitutional abuse of power:
I joined bipartisan @EnergyCommerce leaders in requesting a meeting with @IHSgov to discuss reports of systemic failures at agency hospitals and feedback on how Congress can help improve quality of care for their American Indian and Alaska Native patients.
I am concerned the @FCC may have violated Federal Records Act. We must ensure the @FCC is acting in compliance with the law, which is why @USRepMikeDoyle and I are demanding answers from @AjitPaiFCC.
Proud to join @RepAdams for #HBCUSTEM Day of Action to discuss increasing opportunities for HBCU students in our nation's technology sector.
Whether or not Trump believes in #ClimateChange, it’s happening, and @ENERGY’s energy efficiency program is one of the most consumer-friendly ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It’s absurd the Admin is delaying new standards. Today, we want answers on why. #ActOnClimate
As we continue to face injustice today we should look to their determination and courage for hope and inspiration.

At an @EnergyCommerce hearing today we stressed that the Trump Administration has made it harder for American families to access and sign up for affordable coverage. Democrats want to restore critical outreach funding to #ProtectOurCare.
In the 21st century, access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a right. Democrats are working to give power back to the people and #SaveTheNet.
Since the repeal of #NetNeutrality, ISPs are already throttling streaming speeds, up charging for HD and picking winners and losers. Consumers are left watching the internet slowly change in front of their eyes. It's time to #SaveTheNet
Joining Democratic leaders to unveil #NetNeutrality legislation that will keep the internet open and free.
Examples like this are why we need to modernize our cosmetic safety laws, which have not been updated since 1938! That’s why I am working on a bipartisan proposal to modernize our cosmetic safety laws and protect consumers.
I am thankful @US_FDA accepted my request to investigate the safety of cosmetic products sold by Claire’s and Justice Retail. Unfortunately, FDA found asbestos in products marketed to children and teens and now Claire’s is refusing to voluntarily recall their products.

I have strongly supported the Dream and Promise Act authored by my friend @RepRoybalAllard. This bill would offer a permanent solution to the fabricated crisis the Trump administration has created for TPS and Dreamers in our country.

I have serious concerns about reports that the National Security Council plans to form a secret panel to undermine climate science and downplay #ClimateChange. The consensus is already in, and it calls for action – not clandestine misinformation campaigns.
Trump abandoning the #ParisAgreement abdicated our role as a global leader on #ClimateChange. The federal government simply cannot stand on the sidelines – we must show that we are still committed to this global agreement. #ActOnClimate
.@HouseDemocrats have already taken a stand to protect our democracy. It’s time for @SenateGOP to do the right thing and reject the #FakeEmergency.

#TBT to June of 2016 when @HouseDemocrats led a sit-in in on the House floor to demand action on gun violence. This week we passed legislation to expand background checks and close loopholes for purchasing firearms.
The time for thoughts and prayers is over- now is the time to pass common sense reforms to reduce gun violence and save lives. #HR8 # #HR1112
FBI analysis of the current background check system shows that 3 business days isn't enough time to decide if someone shouldn’t be allowed to own a gun. #HR1112 gives them the time they need to conduct a thorough investigation.
In 2017, 23% of cases where a gun was transferred to a prohibited purchaser involved someone who had been convicted of domestic violence or who had a restraining order. We must fix the #CharlestonLoophole to keep these weapons from falling into the wrong hands!
It is critical for the US to recognize and denounce violent assaults against civilians. That is why I continue to stand with the Armenian people in condemning the horrific massacre known as the Sumgait pogroms.

Congress can pass all of the legislation it wants to protect against air pollution, contaminated drinking water, and hazardous chemical risks, but ultimately, the EPA must implement and enforce those laws.
Today @EnergyCommerce begins critical oversight of the Trump EPA’s enforcement program, something that the previous Republican Majority ignored.
Republicans let #LWCF expire 2x under their watch. Now that @HouseDemocrats are in charge, the House is voting today to permanently authorize it protect our #PublicLands for the long term.
At an @EnergyCommerce hearing on data privacy I emphasized that it is time that we move past an old model that protects the companies using the data, not the people. I plan to work with my colleagues to craft comprehensive privacy legislation that puts consumers first.

Proud that NJ has been named one of the safest states in the country.
Every year, 50,000 people are infected with HIV. During his State of the Union Address, President Trump announced a goal of ending the epidemic in 10 years. I am interested in learning more about the Trump Administration’s @HHSGov’s efforts to end this epidemic.
Ethics rules bar EPA officials from participating in matters involving former clients and clients of their firm, but it appears Wehrum and Harlow may have helped persuade the agency to abandon its position.

It’s unconscionable that YouTube’s algorithms continue to push conspiracy videos to users that spread disinformation and threaten the public health. We will discuss this with the public health experts testifying in front of @EnergyCommerce next week.
Trump’s @EPA continues to drag its feet on meaningful action to protect Americans from exposure to toxic chemicals. It’s time for REAL action, and Congress must step in to protect our drinking water.
“We give our lives and our bodies for our country, and our government does not live up to their end of the deal,” said Army Staff Sergeant Samuel Fortune after reports of the military leaching PFAS into the water for DECADES.

My Facebook Live Q A is Live now. Watch here :
If anyone sees @realDonaldTrump today, please make sure to give him your copy of the constitution.
“This fit of presidential pique is about more than a wall. It constitutes a reordering of the power dynamic between the branches of government. Mr. Trump aims to usurp one of Congress’s most basic responsibilities, the power of the
The wall is costly, impractical and unnecessary. Mexico is never going to pay for, the American people don’t want it and declaring a national emergency to build it is illegal.
Despite the president’s lies, there is no national emergency on our nation’s border and circumventing Congress on this issue will set a dangerous precedent that Republicans may very well regret.
Make no mistake, Democrats will fight President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency in Congress, the courts and wherever in necessary to prevent the president from trampling on the Constitution.
President Trump’s ridiculous demands for a costly and unnecessary border wall previously led to a shutdown that lasted for 35 days. While this agreement is far from perfect, it is a hard earned compromise that avoids another disastrous government shutdown for our country.
Proud to announce that the Visiting Nurse Association of Central Jersey Community Health Center will receive a grant of  $1,583,709. I know that this grant will allow the Center to continue its outstanding work serving our communities.

This editorial is spot on. It is long past time for Congress to give FDA the authority and resources necessary to ensure the safety of cosmetics products.
It is all of our responsibility to confront anti-Semitism whenever and wherever it occurs and I am encouraged that so many have spoken out against these unacceptable remarks and that Rep. Omar has offered an unequivocal apology.
These actions are deeply offensive and they play into the larger narrative of bigotry and prejudice that we have seen grow over the past few years.
Like many Americans and my colleagues who have spoken out today, I am deeply disturbed by Rep. Omar’s use of anti-Semitic remarks. Jewish Americans should be able to participate in our democracy without having their motives and intentions questioned simply because of their faith.

Tonight, President Trump doubled down on the extreme rhetoric and policies that have defined his administration. While the president claimed to be seeking unity, he failed to present the necessary proposals to bring our country together.
We heard a lot of talk from @realDonaldTrump tonight on manufactured crises, but we heard nothing on one of the most important challenges of our time: #ClimateChange. That’s why @EnergyCommerce’s first hearing will be on this issue
Since these are both key priorities of the new Democratic House Majority, I’m hopeful we can work together to strengthen our economy and provide some real relief to New Jerseyans.
Encouraged to hear the President mention investing in infrastructure and lowering the cost of prescription drugs during his address. Still, President Trump has made similar overtures in the past without following through with actual proposals to get results.
