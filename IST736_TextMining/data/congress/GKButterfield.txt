Trump is abusing his power to declare an “emergency” so he can use the military to build his unnecessary and wasteful border wall. Putting aside the fact that this is likely illegal, it’s absurd to think what is happening on the border today qualifies as a national emergency.

From enacting the GOP tax scam to putting Americans with pre-existing conditions at risk and increasing health care costs, President Trump has stacked the deck against working Americans.
"Meanwhile, many people are seeing an increase in taxes due to the bill eliminating many of the deductions that were used by middle-class families in order to lower the amount of taxes they were required to pay."
John Dingell was a legend and a leader for the people. He will forever be remembered as "The Dean" of Congress. I am keeping my dear friend @RepDebDingell and their family in my prayers.
We can’t lose sight of the fact that voting rights remain under attack in our country. We must continue to fight back against voter suppression efforts each and every day.
Let's not forget: President Trump shut down the government for 35 days- the longest in U.S. history- over his border wall he promised that Mexico would pay for. We must keep the pressure on the President the GOP not to go down the shutdown path again.

This #TrumpShutdown is irresponsible and harmful to the American people. When Democrats take control of the House in January, we will work to ensure the Trump Administration and Republicans do not hold the budget process hostage.
The partial government shutdown is about to hit the one-week mark. Instead of ensuring a government that works for American families, #TrumpShutdown means:️25% of federal government shut down.️380,000 workers sent home without pay.️420,000 workers on the job without pay.
Merry Christmas one and all! May this season bring you blessings of joy and peace for the New Year ahead!
Wishing you and your's a Merry Christmas and Happy Holiday! May you go out with joy and be led forth in peace. -GKB
