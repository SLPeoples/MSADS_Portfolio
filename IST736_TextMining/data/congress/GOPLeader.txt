This bill we're about to vote on today— #HR1 —is a massive federal government takeover that would undermine the integrity of our elections.
FACT→  #HR1 would weaken the security of our elections and make it harder to protect against voter fraud.

Protecting innocent life should not be a partisan issue, and it should not be difficult. Doctors should exercise the same level of diligent care to a baby born after surviving an abortion as they would any other baby.

On February 6, 1911, President Ronald Reagan was born. He chose greatness for America, and his legacy continually reminds us: “Man is not free unless government is limited.”

Today, I will ask for a vote on @RepAnnWagner's Born-Alive Protection Act, which would outlaw and penalize infanticide in the United States. If Democrats object, we will ask again. And again. And again, until the House of Representatives speaks up for life.
The President continued to make a clear case for stronger border security. Here are more takeaways from last night's #SOTU.

President Trump just hit it out of the park. He offered a vision of America that both parties can support. Now, Democrats have a choice. They can continue to resist or they can choose to work together to keep making America greater than ever. #SOTU
President Trump is right. Congress should vote to prohibit late-term abortions of children who can feel pain in their mother’s womb. All children—born and unborn—are made in God's image.
The challenge is also a humanitarian crisis, affecting not only those who seek to enter the United States but also the American families devastated by destructive drugs and crime. We must solve this crisis. We must #SecureTheBorder

VA Governor Ralph Northam’s past racist behavior caps a week where he displayed an egregious lack of respect for human dignity and the American values that we fight every day to uphold. Staying in office only poisons efforts to grow together as one nation. He should resign.

To all members of Congress...Let's stop the political scores and actually get to work. #SecureTheBorder
If these names sound familiar, it's because these are some of the same individuals Speaker Pelosi so passionately spoke about just a year ago on the House floor. Democrats CLAIM to want to help them, but their defense of the status quo shows otherwise.
These are just 50 names of Americans whose lives have been lost to illegal immigration. Their families did not celebrate the status quo preserved by Democrats.
Last week, Dems celebrated keeping status quo. Meanwhile,● 300 Americans die weekly from heroin, 90% of which comes across Southern border● 10k children are smuggled into the US yearly to be sold for human trafficking● 700k DACA individuals remain unsure about their future
Democrats' actions these last 4 weeks tell you all you need to know about who they *truly* want to help—THEMSELVES.
A reminder → The President offered four reasonable solutions to end the shutdown and secure our border. The Democrats never offered one.
At a time when the country expects its leaders in Washington to look forward, Democrats are looking backward. When our country expects solutions, they are using the House chamber to settle political scores.
