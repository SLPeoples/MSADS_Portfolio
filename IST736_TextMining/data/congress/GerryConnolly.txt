I fear that the breach of trust this represents for those who entrusted him with their votes and confidence cannot easily be recovered and the profound hurt those pictures evoke cannot easily be healed.
Governor Northam must search his heart to determine whether he can or should continue in office.
The question now is whether redemption and forgiveness are achievable under these circumstances and in the explosive racial environment of the Trump alt right era.
Governor Northam has acknowledged that he posed for that offensive picture, apologized and asserted that he no longer holds those racist views. I take him at his word.

He did so several times before the President’s temper tantrum. As a member of a coequal branch of government, he must do so again.
Democrats will continue to pass bipartisan appropriations bills to reopen the government and invest in border security. I hope Mitch McConnell can see himself to supporting either these bills or a CR to reopen government.
The President does not have a plan to reopen the government. Unilateral announcements are not deals. Mexico isn’t paying for the wall. The President taking new hostages, this time Dreamers, is not going to end the Trump Shutdown.

We shouldn’t be surprised that Trump has no empathy for federal employees and contractors who’ve been out of work for 25 days. This is a guy who made a fortune stiffing middle class contractors on Trump properties.

Kevin McCarthy all but admitted government will shut down tonight in colloquy on House floor.
The #TrumpShutdown is pointless and harmful. My Republican colleagues know that keeping the government open is Congress’s core responsibility. Yet they have surrendered our independence and our authority to placate a volatile president.
What shouldn’t be lost in Trump’s shutdown is House Republicans are allowing the Violence Against Women Act to expire. A shameful end to Speaker Ryan’s tenure.
Merry Shutdown and bah humbug.
Just 10 days ago you said “I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it.” You said it on camera in your own office. A week of your presidency may feel like a lifetime, Mr. President, but it’d be pretty hard to forget that.
A reminder for today that despite what the President tweets during Executive Time, he already said he would be the one to own this Christmas Shutdown. His chaos and dysfunction is no way to run government.
Quite a day in our nation's Capital. The brink of a #TrumpShutdown. A unilateral retreat from Syria. The stock market in chaos. Meanwhile, Mike Pence fiddles.
Mattis resignation, Syria abandonment and government shutdown. Can anyone spell crisis ?
President Trump’s Oval Office temper tantrum didn’t get him his wall, so now he’s throwing a bigger one. But don’t forget: if the government shuts down, he already told us who to blame.P.S. Wasn't Mexico supposed to pay for the wall?
Speaker Ryan, you don’t work for Trump. He can’t tell the House and Senate what to do. Show some courage and standup to the Shutdown Caucus. Let the House vote.
