Today I'd like to honor all of the incredible women who work around the clock to serve #TX23 and inspire me every day. I am so proud to have each of them on #TeamHurd #InternationalWomensDay #WomensHistoryMonth
The Equifax cyber breach that stole the personal consumer credit data of 143 million Americans could have been very easily prevented. We must improve the way we exchange information between the public and private sectors so we can prevent future cyberattacks. @CNBCTheExchange

Women are shaping our nation's history each and every day. Incredible way to cap off #WomensHistoryMonth and pave the way for future #WomeninSTEM @NASA

In case you missed it: I talked with the @treywareshow on @ktsanews this morning about North Korea, my new bill to help our border patrol, securing our border and more. Click on the link below to listen in -- It's a good one
When we're talking, we're not fighting, and these are high stakes negotiations that won't get resolved over two meetings. The President made clear at the #NorthKoreaSummit that the United States is not going to accept a quick deal over a good deal.
My morning read �️: in 2018 our nation's economy grew at the highest rate in 13 years.
Y’all be sure to tune in.
Our federal government still has work to do, but I'm encouraged by the VA's efforts toward an EHR system. Modernizing our federal IT sets a standard not just for our veterans population but for all American citizens as we make strides toward a new national standard.
When we’re talking, we’re not fighting. Two years ago we were worried about an imminent nuclear war with North Korea. We have a long way to go before achieving denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula, but these talks are another step in right direction.
Tomorrow, I will join my colleagues to introduce bipartisan legislation that requires Congressional approval for an emergency to last longer than 60 days. If Speaker Pelosi is serious about reasserting Congress’s constitutional powers, she will bring it to the floor for a vote.
We have a problem at our border which is why I have supported over $220B for homeland security including technology, manpower and barriers. But possibly taking money from Joint Base SA, Laughlin AFB and Fort Bliss will not help. That’s why I voted against the national emergency.
I always stand ready to work with you to tell our story for centuries. We have to record our history.  We owe it to future generations to inform them of our debates, our mistakes and our triumphs so they can be informed and inspired.
Great to see the hard work put in by young folks at the Texas Junior Agricultural #Mechanics Show at the @SanAntonioRodeo. Whether they're constructing livestock equipment, trailers or machinery, they're playing an important role in the future of our #ag and #STEM industries.

Discrimination based on age, race or gender has no place in today’s workplace. Proud to help introduce this bipartisan bill so all of our nation’s workers can continue to support their families and help our businesses and economy thrive.
I stand with @USAmbIndia and @rashtrapatibhvn in condemning the horrible #KashmirTerrorAttack on CRPF personnel. I spent part of my CIA career in India working to stop terrorist organizations and will continue to do so in Congress in solidarity with our allies across the globe.
Pulling out of NAFTA to force an affirmative vote on USMCA would be counterproductive to efforts to approve the new agreement. Working with Congress is a more viable path to success than trying to hold NAFTA hostage.

There's no question we need to secure our border, but we shouldn't be negotiating on the backs of hundreds of thousands of federal employees working without pay to keep Americans safe.

I’ve said it for weeks. Detaining kids in Tornillo and tearing apart families has done nothing to fix our broken immigration system. This is welcome news.
My friend @RepStefanik always gives good advice.
New year, same bipartisan commitment to strengthen national cybersecurity make our federal government more efficient
It starts with the philosophy that my bosses are the 800,000 people that I represent, not anybody else. It’s not rocket science.
Proud to reintroduce this bill with @RepRobinKelly today to ensure our federal government has a Federal CIO to oversee the security of our digital infrastructure and keep Americans' information safe.
The crown prince and his government must change course, or there will need to be new Saudi leadership if the close, decades-long cooperation between Washington and Riyadh is to continue.

I said it yesterday and I'll say it again today. An American retreat only emboldens ISIS. This is one example of the terrible consequences of pulling out of Syria, and there'll surely be more to come. 
An American retreat from Syria emboldens ISIS. An American retreat from Afghanistan emboldens Al-Qaeda and undermines the ultimate sacrifice already paid by thousands of Americans. Both will threaten our Homeland again.
A massive retreat of our global leadership only emboldens the mass murderers and oppressors around the world.  If we don’t stand up, who will?
I slept better at night knowing that General Mattis was protecting our nation, our allies, and our brave men and women in uniform – many of whom I’ve worked with in the trenches. This is bad news for the nation and the security of the world.
The American people sent us up here to get things done, and the only way we can get things done is by working together.
Cyber attribution is a cyber deterrent. I applaud @TheJusticeDept and @FBI for their investigation and indictment, and I also thank @FBISanAntonio in my hometown for their important role in this investigation.
This shows the importance of continuing bipartisan, bicameral work to improve our government's ability to defend our digital infrastructure through the #MGTact, #FITARA, empowering a Federal CIO and the SECURE Technology Act (which passed the House and Senate last night).
China's objectives are clear: using hacking to steal advanced technology and bolster its position at the expense of other nations.
China methodically siphoned out an immeasurable amount of intellectual property, undermining years of research and development and doing irreparable harm to over 40 companies and government agencies like @NASA and the @USNavy.
This Chinese state-sponsored cyber attack was pervasive, infiltrating systems in the U.S. and around the globe for over four years. We are in a hot war with China, and cyber space is the battle space.
We have to look at what our allies and enemies think. The fact that Russia, Iran, and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad all support this decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria is a problem. We cannot allow ISIS to regroup, train, equip and run operations unencumbered.
Public libraries, especially in rural areas, do much more than simply offer books. They’re often the main provider of literacy programming, tech training job seeking assistance in many #TX23 communities. Glad my colleagues came together to support our bipartisan bill today
We cannot abandon our allies, like the Syrian Democratic Forces, and create an opening for ISIS, Iran and Russia to determine the fate of millions of Syrians and create a safe haven for terrorist groups that threaten our security.
ISIS is a global threat and could re-emerge as a destructive insurgency in Syria and Iraq.
Withdrawing our ground forces undermines the strong, global coalition we built to defeat this threat. It is clear from available intelligence that ISIS is trying to rebuild and still commands a significant fighting force of over 30k.
Earlier this month, the US-led coalition to defeat ISIS was undertaking new operations in Eastern Syria. And last week the Chairman of Joint Chiefs said we’ve only trained 20% of the forces necessary to stabilize areas formerly held by ISIS.
.@RepKinzinger is right. This decision undercuts the chance of completely defeating ISIS and instead bolsters the Assad regime, which has gassed its own people, killed hundreds of thousands and caused over 6M refugees.
We're better than this. This is a symptom of a larger problem we’ve spent years ignoring – our broken immigration system. And similar to building a wall from sea to shining sea, detaining kids in Tornillo is the most expensive and least effective way to solve anything.
NOW: Talking to ⁦@mitchellreports⁩ about the latest in Tornillo.
I’m glad new leadership at @HHSGov tweaked this policy that created the need for unnecessary facilities like in Tornillo. We can place children in a safe environment and reduce the administrative hurdles to close the Tornillo facility by the new
We are the United States of America… we are better than this.

Just got off the phone with management at Tornillo tent facility. Contract set to end Dec 31 but @HHSGov has no plan for 2800 kids.
The fact of the matter is clear and simple: we work better when we work together. As the holiday season continues, I encourage everyone to reflect on this spirit of the season and carry a perspective of kindness, civility and cooperation into the New Year.
For the past 13 years, volunteers have gathered to remember our fallen heroes by laying wreaths at over 1200 cemeteries across the country. My team and I were humbled to participate in this year’s @WreathsAcross at Fort Sam Houston in #SanAntonio.
Talked with @KABBFOX29 earlier tonight about major bipartisan wins in Congress this week. From saving hard-earned taxpayer dollars keeping you safe to providing certainty for #TX23's 9k farms ranches, I'll continue to work hard to deliver real results for South West Texans.
As a result of bipartisan IT policies, the federal government saved over $714 million in taxpayer dollars this year alone. It has been an honor to serve as IT Subcommittee Chair over the last 4 years, and I'll continue to find ways for the federal government to be more efficient.
It's official! The DHS Data Framework Act is off to the President's desk and will be my 13th piece of legislation signed into law since 2015. Glad my colleagues and I could get this bipartisan initiative to keep Americans safe across the finish line.
In our interconnected world, we must be able to get the right info to the right people at the right time to keep terrorists on the run and off our shores. I thank my House and Senate colleagues for getting this bipartisan initiative to keep Americans safe across the finish line
