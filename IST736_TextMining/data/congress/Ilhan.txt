In 2019, no one should have their right to vote denied. Let’s restore and strengthen the Voting Rights Act. Let’s pass HR4. #RestoreTheVote
As one voter suppression expert wrote, “It is just so Jim Crow… What we have today, with poll closures done in the interest of ‘streamlining’ and ‘saving taxpayer money,’ is no less pernicious. And no less pervasive.”
In 2018 alone, 10 counties with large black populations in Georgia closed polling spots after a white elections consultant recommended they do so to save money
In Georgia, where Brian Kemp oversaw the largest voter purge in history, poll closures correlate almost perfectly with high poverty areas across the state—where people are more likely to vote Democratic
In North Carolina’s majority-black Mecklenburg County, poll closures reduced black turnout by over 50 percent(!) in 2016
Indiana has shuttered more than 1/5 of all polling locations
Arizona, has closed 200 voting sites, more per capita than even Texas
Texas, where the growing Latino population threatens Republican dominance, closed over 400 polling places since 2013
Here are some of the worst examples:
And now we know why: Within five years of that decision, nearly 1,000 polling places in the U.S. have been closed—many of them in primarily black counties
It was a direct rebuke of the Civil Rights Movement and Dr. Martin Luther King
In 2013, the Supreme Court gutted Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act– making it more difficult for black and minority voters to vote
Quick thread on why the Voting Rights Advancement Act is so important
Mark my words: #MedicareforAll is going to be the law of the land.
Not getting enough attention: U.S.-made weapons shipped to Saudi Arabia and UAE ended up in the hands of al Qaeda and other extremists, violating the law.Proud to join @RepEliotEngel on a bipartisan letter holding the Administration accountable. It's time to end this war.

Women of color are less likely to have quality healthcare coverage. Over 20% of households of color experience hunger at some point, 2x the rates for white households. And in no city has the homeownership gap been closed.The pay gap is more than just a gender issue.

My thoughts are with @RepDebDingell and her whole family during this difficult time.
John Dingell defined statesmanship. Every year, for 5 decades, Rep. Dingell would introduce a single-payer health care bill in the House. I know that when we finally pass Medicare for All to guarantee health care as a human right, John will be smiling down.

In 2017, the CEO of McDonalds got paid $21.8 million.The median pay for a McDonald's worker that year was $7,000.This is a moral outrage. We need a $15 minimum wage so that no one is paid a poverty wage. #RaiseTheWage
This is the biggest challenge of our time. Let’s seize the moment. Let’s put the policies behind the Green New Deal into law! ��
We cannot let the urgency of this die. We can’t just settle for a select committee or resolution. We rallied for a big bold solution and momentum for our policies is at an all-time high.
That’s why one of my top priorities is a bill to fully divest from dirty energy.
We are here to legislate to our reality. And the reality is we’re in the majority.
We need to pass a #GreenNewDeal to shift away from fossil fuels and create millions of jobs.
