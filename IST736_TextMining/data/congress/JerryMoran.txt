It is wrong that so many suffer because of political infighting and dysfunction in Washington. Congress must pass a funding bill that the president will sign so we can return to a fully-functioning federal government. My full statement following today's votes:
These workers and their families, our fellow Americans, should not bear the burden of our political infighting. Congress must pass a compromise funding bill that the president will sign so we can return to a fully-functioning government. 3/3
Most importantly, federal employees’ paychecks should not be held hostage and they must be paid. It is immoral that many families living paycheck-to-paycheck have to work without pay, and I recognize the emotional and financial stress this uncertainty causes. 2/3
After today’s votes, it's expected the federal government will remain partially closed. This shutdown – which should have never happened – must end. Our government’s continued dysfunction is extremely harmful to our economy, businesses individuals around the country. 1/3
