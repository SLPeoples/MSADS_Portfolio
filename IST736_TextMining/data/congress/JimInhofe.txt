There is no country without borders and there is no unity without a common language.  As we work to #BuildTheWall, I have also introduced a bill to establish English as our official language. Via @abby_bitterman of @GaylordNews ️
Anti-Semitic comments of any kind have no place anywhere, let alone here in Congress. The U.S. has a true friend in Israel and I am firm believer in that fact. Click here for my thoughts on our relationship with Israel ️
I asked the chain of command from each service to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee because the health, safety and welfare of our service members and their families are the responsibility of everyone, from the Secretary to the squad leader. Plain and simple.
Language has the power to unify people of all walks of life; by establishing English as the official language of our nation we will become further united. That's why I introduced The English Language Unity Act today with @SenatorRounds.

Heartbreaking—the fact that Dems blocked this shows how radical of step they are w/ the American people. The House must bring this important bill to a vote so Americans can see where all their elected officials stand in protecting the innocent babies who survive abortions.
After the shocking statements from the VA Gov in support of withholding medical care to babies aborted alive, Democrats claimed they were not the party of infanticide. The Senate Dems refusal to vote for this bill today shows that they are just that—the party of infanticide.
Tonight, Senate Dems can vote to protect babies who are born alive after an attempted abortion by requiring doctors to provide the same level of medical care they would any other baby or they can stay silent and tacitly endorse infanticide. This is simple.

Good to catch up with Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan at Munich Security Conference today. Pleased he could be here to represent the United States to our allies and partners.
Visited with German Minister of Defense to affirm the importance of the US-German alliance and emphasize our shared commitment to increasing NATO burden sharing in all its forms - cash, capabilities and contributions. #MSC2019
I also met with Poland’s Minister of Defense today to discuss our alliance and robust security cooperation. We also discussed the future of an enhanced US military presence in Poland, which is the subject of an upcoming Department of Defense report directed by last year’s NDAA.
They’re doing more to shoulder the burden of common security with more than $41 b in extra defense spending since @realDonaldTrump took office. A strong NATO is not just good for Europe. It is in America's national security interest.
I also met with @NATO SecGen @jensstoltenberg to reaffirm America's ironclad commitment to the NATO alliance. America's allies have our back. They're fighting with us in Afghanistan. They're unified w/ us in condemning Russia's violation of the INF Treaty.
It is clear to me that @POTUS’ South Asia strategy is working. It has given the Afghan people a real chance to achieve a sustainable peace. At this pivotal moment, American support for Afghanistan remains critical.
Today I was pleased to meet with President @ashrafghani at #MSC2019 to thank him for his leadership and to hear his assessment of the political, economic security situation in Afghanistan.

Oklahomans deserve to have Congress act to alleviate the regulatory overreach established by Dodd-Frank. That's why I'm proud to cosponsor the CFPB Accountability Act of 2019. Thanks to @sendavidperdue for taking the lead on this bill. Let's make this legislation a reality.
We’ve seen how Oklahoma banks are being forced to spend more and more of their time and resources on complying with federal government mandates, and less on their customers—driving up costs for families, small businesses, farmers and ranchers.
For the last eight years, under Dodd-Frank, the CFPB has held far too much power with virtually no Congressional oversight.
Glad to sit down with the Oklahoma National Guard today, including @bg_tinkham, the first female general in @OKGuard history. Thank you all for your service—I am incredibly proud of the work we've gotten done together and I look forward to all we will accomplish this year.

Tax cuts have gotten America’s economic engine moving again.  It happened in the 80s when Reagan last accomplished comprehensive tax reform, and we are seeing it happen again.  We've seen businesses expand, reinvest in the future and create over 25,000 jobs in Oklahoma.
@realDonaldTrump Our NATO allies fully support this action, and continued consultation is critical. We cannot keep jeopardizing our partners, troops and infrastructure for a one-sided treaty.
It’s been 60 days since @realDonaldTrump told Vladimir Putin to stop violating the INF treaty, but Russia hasn’t taken any meaningful steps to come into compliance. I’m pleased that the United States will begin the process to formally withdraw.
There is an old document that nobody reads anymore called the Constitution. Too often today, students aren’t being taught about the Constitution, its history or its principles. @SenAngusKing, @ChrisCoons and I introduced the CIVICS Act today to change that.

Glad to intro S. 249 w/ @SenatorMenendez, @marcorubio, @SenSherrodBrown @SenMarkey, @SenBillCassidy, @JohnBoozman @SenatorLankford. This bill calls for the Sec State to develop a strategy for Taiwan to regain observer status in the WHO. It's time Taiwan had a seat at the table
Taiwan has long shown its commitment to world health and has earned a seat at the table in all international bodies, especially those where they have shown substantial positive leadership.
Actively working to include Taiwan in the World Health Assembly will go a long way in checking China’s efforts to enact their expansionist agenda through international organizations.
China continues to block Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Assembly through diplomatic bullying for the third consecutive year.
Looking forward to the great things we'll get done under @realDonaldTrump and @EPAAWheeler in 2019. Bc of their leadership, Oklahoma farmers, ranchers, homebuilders and energy producers can now focus on their business instead of red tape. Look at all we did in 2018:

The same Dems saying a border wall is too expensive voted to give Pres Obama $787 b for failed stimulus—which ended up costing the US taxpayer $836 b—confirming yet again that Dems are willing to oppose any policy, even ones they have supported in the past, just to oppose @POTUS

I'm glad the Senate confirmed fellow Oklahoman @kdroege to be @WHOSTP Director. The President requires the most well-qualified advisors and Dr. Droegemeier provides the experience and ability necessary to get the job done right. My thoughts here
The Democrats are refusing do what is right and secure our borders, calling it an ‘expensive and ineffective solution,' but we know walls work. I fully support @realDonaldTrump and I hope my colleagues across the aisle will come to their senses. Let's  #BuildTheWall.

@SecPompeo We will no longer tolerate Russian deception at the expense of national security security of our allies. While we’ve lived up to our commitments under the treaty, Russia has violated it for years w/o repercussions—putting our troops, allies and infrastructure at greater risk

Kay and I have known the Bush family for a long time—dating back to their time in the Texas oil industry, traveling back and forth to Tulsa—and he was always a devoted husband and loving father. We were friends before we were in politics, and I am grateful for his friendship.
George H.W. Bush loved this country and served it tirelessly and with a passion. As a naval aviator, an ambassador, director of the CIA, and as president of these great United States, George Bush put service to his nation and love for his family above all else.
Every day, military families make commitments and sacrifices in support of our military and our country. To all families who love and support our troops, we say thank you.
President Trump can prevent this $33 billion cut and the resulting damage by ordering the Pentagon to move forward with the $733 billion budget he originally proposed for 2020. We cannot and should not balance our budget on the backs of America’s troops.
The administration’s National Defense Strategy prioritized strategic competition with China and Russia. But to be effective, strategies must be matched with resources. America won’t succeed without sustained, sufficient, predictable military funding.
Read the op-ed @MacPressTX and I wrote in @WSJopinion about the importance of not cutting military spending. This is a time to follow through on the progress of the past 2 years give our troops the sustained, sufficient, predictable funding they deserve.
