I’m @rimosaorg geeking out at the 4th Annual Rhode Island Brain Week kick-off with friends from @BrownUniversity, @universityofri, @VAProvidence, and @MigraineDisordr! Basic and translational research leads to remarkable medical advancements and improves patients’ lives.
The feeling of #Irish pride is palpable in #Providence today at the St. Patrick’s Day Parade! �
ICYMI, I questioned @SecNielsen about why President Trump stated apprehensions at the border were at an all-time high when the facts from her Department clearly demonstrate otherwise. #NielsenHearing
Chatted with @PVA1946 representatives about several important issues, including my Air Carrier Access Amendments Act to help disabled air travelers. Thanks for all of your advocacy on behalf of #veterans with #disabilities!
Must read in @NYTopinion - @BrookingsInst’s General John R. Allen and David G. Victor on the White House’s dangerous attempts at “browbeating our scientific and intelligence community into its political line.” #ClimateSecurityIsNationalSecurity
This #InternationalWomensDay, I’m particularly proud to serve alongside a record number of women in the House of Representatives. But there’s more work to do, so let’s redouble our efforts to achieve full gender equality.  #IWD2019
Proud to support #HR1! This bill advances critical reforms to restore the promise of our democracy #ForThePeople.
#HR1 will take money out of politics and make elections more ethical and accessible. I am proud it also contains important #cybersecurity provisions I helped author to prevent foreign operations intended to undermine our democracy. #ForThePeople

Protecting power plants, hospitals other critical infrastructure assets from #cyber threats begins with a workforce equipped with the skills. Thrilled to introduce a bill w/ @CongressmanGT to boost #cybersecurity skills training in career technical education (#CTE) programs.
The fight for a free and open Internet is not over. Proud to cosponsor @USRepMikeDoyle’s Save the Internet Act to restore @FCC’s 2015 #NetNeutrality Rules. #SaveTheNet
Chatted with @NEHChair at the #HumHill19 reception last night – and got to brag about RI humanities leaders @ToubaGhadessi and @rihumanities director Dr. Elizabeth Francis. Senator Pell would be proud!
Shocking that @SecNielsen refused to back up her own employees @CBP in the face of the President’s false statements. There is no universe where 400k is greater than 1.6 million. Deeply disappointed that she did not testify to that effect @HomelandDems.
Congratulations to my good friend and fellow cyber junkie @RepMcCaul in getting his Cyber Diplomacy Act marked up out of @HouseForeign! Great to see @RepEliotEngel making #cybersecurity an early priority for the committee.
I support the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act (#HR1044) so talented scientists like the Senguptas, Sadhak and Sudarshana, can pursue their dreams and #RI can benefit from their innovation and entrepreneurship.
As a quadriplegic, I’m familiar with the obstacles people with #disabilities encounter when flying. I introduced the Air Carrier Access Amendments Act w/ @SenatorBaldwin @RepDinaTitus @RepCohen so passengers with disabilities are able to fly with dignity.
Ensuring every American has the opportunity to participate in our elections is at the core of our democracy. Proud to join @GerryConnolly in reintroducing the FAST Voting Act to safeguard the vote and encourage higher voter participation.
On #NationalDentistDay, I am thinking of my good friend Dr. Jeffrey Dodge and the team at #RI Mission of Mercy who host an annual free dental clinic for families in need!
Despite @DHSgov Secretary Nielsen’s attempts to spin the truth, the number of apprehensions along the border remains well below historic highs. #NielsenHearing

Cogent analysis by Michelle Melton @lawfareblog – there is no future in denying the national security implications of climate change. But taking this anti-reality approach underground – and away from FACA – is concerning. #ClimateSecurityIsNationalSecurity

The gun violence epidemic in our country is a true national emergency, and the past several years of Congressional inaction is reprehensible. Proud to vote in favor of #HR8 to require universal background checks on all gun sales. We need #GunSafetyNow.
Access to health care should be a right for everyone, including people with #disabilities who rely on long-term services supports (#LTSS). That’s why I joined @RepJayapal, @RepDebDingell fellow @HouseDemocrats to introduce #MedicareForAll!

I first championed the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed Protection Act in 2010. Now, with the help of @RepJoeCourtney and @DavidCicilline, this legislation to add important federal protections for these #SouthCounty rivers has passed the House and will soon become law.
I proudly cast my vote today to defend the checks and balances in our government and terminate the President’s unconstitutional #FakeNationalEmergency declaration.
.@HouseDemocrats’ #PublicLands package represents a big win #ForThePeople. It permanently reauthorizes #LWCF and adds critical protections to the Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed (@WpWildRivers) in southern #RI! �
Glad my friend Ed Garcia of @CranstonLibrary representing the #RI @ALALibrary chapter could stop by the office. Thank you for your advocacy!

Former national security officials from both sides of the aisle are condemning the President’s #FAKENationalEmergency. Looking forward to taking the first step to undoing it by passing @JoaquinCastrotx’s resolution tomorrow.
Thanks to @SenJackReed, new federal funds are set to flow to #RI to help restore bridges in desperate need of repair. We must keep up the fight for federal #infrastructure investment to support @GovRaimondo and @RIDOTNews by passing @SenWhitehouse and my SAFE Bridges Act.

Stopped by @QuonsetRI to see @RIDOTNews launch its “Little Roady” autonomous vehicle pilot project. Thanks @GovRaimondo for leading the way in the research testing of this emerging technology.
That the President is considering this shows his continued willingness to play politics w/ the professionals of our intelligence community. Congress will not let this ridiculous committee go forward unchecked. #ClimateSecurityIsNationalSecurity
Thinking of the brave first responders survivors and remembering the victims of the #StationFire that happened 16 years ago today.
It’s very exciting that we are another step closer to protecting the Wood-Pawcatuck watershed through a Wild and Scenic River designation, which will help ensure these waterways remain pristine and accessible for future generations.
The President cannot subvert Congress’s role in determining if nuclear transactions are made in the interest of American national security.

I was disappointed in last night’s #SOTU. While the President touched on several important topics, he spent far too much time discussing issues that divide us rather than ones that bring us together. My full reaction:
Great to see @RichardTrumka with @AFLCIO representing workers across the county at tonight’s #SOTU.
Proud to have @CardiCorp’s Steve Cardi – a #RI construction leader – join me as my guest at the #SOTU. Infrastructure investment is a bipartisan priority that will drive economic expansion and improve the daily lives of Rhode Islanders and people across the country.
In 2018, I helped secure grant funding for economic development, infrastructure investment, mental health services and more. Organizations in the Second District and Rhode Island statewide agencies benefited from more than $245 million in federal grants. #LangevinLookBack2018

Today I voted for a 2.6% pay increase for civilian federal workers, many of whom have been subjected to weeks of hardship during the #TrumpShutdown. We owe these public servants our gratitude, and they deserve fair compensation for their work.
It was a pleasure to meet with @MentoringRI’s @joloscho and Christopher Margadanna this National #MentoringMonth. Strong mentors can have amazing impacts on a young person’s life.

Had a great time attending the @FLLRI State Championship last weekend. The brilliant young students taking part in this very cool #STEAM program are well-positioned to be the scientists and engineers of tomorrow. 
After 35 days of self-inflicted hardship, the President has finally accepted reality and agreed to end the #TrumpShutdown. I hope he realizes once and for all it is unacceptable to use federal workers and the American public as political pawns.
Senate Republicans can help #EndTheShutdown. They just need to take up one of the many bipartisan House-passed bills that reopens the government.
ICYMI, my bill with @CongressmanGT to modernize @NationalFFA passed unanimously in the House earlier this week. This legislation supports a stronger #FFA that is equipped to train the next generation of agriculture leaders.
Yesterday, @HouseDemocrats passed yet another proposal to #EndTheShutdown. The President must reopen the government immediately; only then can we proceed with border security talks.
Looking forward to chairing the Subcommittee on Intelligence, Emerging Threats Capabilities to advance policies that protect our nation from #cyber threats preserve our military superiority. Grateful to my fellow @HASCDemocrats for this opportunity.
I will work with the President on sensible solutions to improve our border security, but we cannot hold federal workers hostage during negotiations. This bill provides yet another alternative on the menu of options to #EndTheShutdown
Given the #TrumpShutdown, it’s not clear who’s going to be on hand to implement @CISAgov’s emergency directive within the next 10 days. And this needed to be done yesterday, not 10 days from now. @snlyngaas on DNS-hijacking and the .gov.
This afternoon, the House passed my bill w/ @CongressmanGT that makes overdue updates to #FFA’s charter. Today’s @NationalFFA not only trains future #farmers, it also helps prepare the next generation of scientists, veterinarians, and business owners. #CTE
Let’s call the #TransMilitaryBan what it is: bigotry. It’s past time @DeptofDefense welcomed patriotic #trans Americans who want to serve their country.
.@USATODAY reports "many employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations," according to @TSA. We cannot expect federal employees to report to work indefinitely without pay. We must #EndTheShutdown immediately. 
Thank you to the Ebenezer Baptist Church community for having me at your annual #MLKDay celebration. It’s a great honor to join you again this year.
Proud to join @RI_CNCS and today at their annual #MLK Day of Service. @AmeriCorps state members are cleaning classrooms, painting canvas murals, and hosting a community lunch discussion to reflect on Dr. King’s teachings.
Martin Luther King Day is an opportunity to come together, not just to commemorate one of our nation’s greatest heroes, but to reflect on how we are living out his legacy today. #MLK90
The @Patriots are AFC champs and headed back to the #SuperBowl yet again! #GoPats #EverythingWeGot
Glad to see this nice gesture by @RIPhilharmonic offering free tickets to federal employees affected by the shutdown.
It’s time we stop talking past each other and find real solutions to #EndTheShutdown that has caused serious harm to federal workers and the American public.
I am ready and willing to work with the President and my Congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass comprehensive immigration reform that strengthens and improves our border security, but before we do so the President must reopen the government immediately.
The Trump Administration released an incomplete #climatechange report that fell well short of what my amendment required. @nkus does a great job of outlining how it missed the mark. #ClimateSecurityIsNationalSecurity
The domino effects of the #TrumpShutdown continue to cause hardship. Schools and families across the country should never have to worry about being able to feed their kids. #EndTheShutdown
If, as reported, the President Trump instructed his personal attorney to commit perjury before Congress, he has obstructed justice. The American people need to hear from President Trump and Mr. Cohen immediately to learn the truth of this grave matter.

My amendment required the @DeptofDefense to outline the risks #climatechange poses to U.S. military bases. Unfortunately, this report is half-baked and does not reflect the urgency of the challenge. #ClimateSecurityisNationalSecurity 
“Cyber attackers aren't taking a shutdown. They're taking advantage of the shutdown,” - @brucemcconnell via @Joseph_Marks_Maintaining our #cybersecurity is yet another critical reason we need to #EndTheShutdown.
Since when did keeping the government open become a ‘poison pill’?
.@HouseDemocrats have a simple message for the President: we can debate how best to protect our border after we #EndTheShutdown. Sadly, House Republicans, taking direction from the President, chose to oppose our latest plan and prolong the #TrumpShutown.
ICYMI, I invited @SenJackReed , @SenWhitehouse @davidcicilline to join me in unison with unpaid federal employees @tfgreenairport to demand the government be reopened.
.@myrwu is looking out for our @USCG sailors who will miss their paychecks today due to the #TrumpShutdown. It’s disgraceful that we have reached this point. The President needs to #EndTheShutdown immediately.
We rely on @TSA agents and @FAANews air traffic controllers to keep the traveling public safe and secure, and they deserve better than to be left wondering if they will be able to pay their bills. It's time for the President to work with Democrats and #EndTheShutdown.
Along with @SenJackReed @SenWhitehouse @DavidCicilline, I will meet with local federal employees @tfgreenairport at 10:15 to call for an end to the #TrumpShutdown. Tune in live:
In the midst of troubled times @Patriots show what can be accomplished when you work together. #EverythingWeGot
I’ll be @tfgreenairport on Monday morning w/ @SenWhitehouse, @DavidCicilline federal employees to call for an end to the #TrumpShutdown.
Yesterday, 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheck. Today, the #TrumpShutdown became the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. This is a complete failure of government, and Americans deserve better. We must #EndTheShutdown!
@HouseDemocrats have spent the week passing bills to reopen the government at bipartisan funding levels. Today we voted to fund the @EPA and the @NatlParkService yet the President continues to obstruct and the #TrumpShutdown goes on.
800,000 federal workers will miss a paycheck today due to the #TrumpShutdown. These are everyday families with bills to pay, and they don’t deserve to be treated as political pawns. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown.
It’s #Day20 of the #TrumpShutdown, and more Americans are feeling the effects with each passing day. The President must work with Congress and accept the bipartisan solution we’ve passed to reopen the government immediately.
Today, I again voted to reopen the IRS, SBA and other key federal agencies. Rhode Islanders deserve to receive their tax refunds on time and in full. It’s time to end the #TrumpShutdown.
#SNAP provides crucial nutrition assistance to millions of Americans. I joined @rosadelauro and 127 of my fellow @HouseDemocrats in demanding a plan from @USDA to ensure RI families will not go hungry as a result of the #TrumpShutdown.
We need border security solutions that are grounded in reality, not the result of political posturing. Tonight, the President has only pledged that the painful #TrumpShutdown will continue even longer.
About 65,000 households in #RI rely on #SNAP nutrition assistance programs. If the #TrumpShutdown continues, many of these families and millions more across the country will struggle to put food on the table. We must reopen the government #ForThePeople.
Americans shouldn’t have to wait for their tax refunds over the President’s continued refusal to work with Congress. @HouseDemocrats will vote to reopen critical government services separate from the border wall debate.
ICYMI, I caught up with @wpri12 to discuss what it meant to be named the first Speaker pro tempore of the 116th Congress and preside over opening day.
Energized by the start from @HouseDemocrats in the new Congress and proud to be a consponsor of the #ForThePeople Act!
Tax refund delays are yet another reason why we must put an end to the #TrumpShutdown. Senate Republicans and the President should approve the House-passed funding bills to reopen the government.
Today, @HouseDemocrats unveil HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, which will help fight corruption by expanding voting rights and limiting the influence of money in politics. Especially proud that election #cybersecurity provisions I worked with @HomelandDems on are included.
I am proud that our new Democratic majority wasted no time and voted to end the #TrumpShutdown on the opening day of the legislative session. 
RT @RepBrianMast: 5 eyes. 5 arms. 4 legs. All American.Welcome to Congress, @ElectJimBaird @DanCrenshawTX.
Honored that @SpeakerPelosi has selected me as the first Speaker pro tempore for the new session of Congress! Today marks a renewed commitment to creating a more inclusive government that works for everyone. Livestream starts soon on @cspan.
My heart goes out to the families and loved ones of the missing Point Judith fishermen. 
It’s time to reopen the government. Today, the House will vote to put an end to the #TrumpShutdown that’s hurting federal workers, businesses and countless American families.
Excited to begin a new legislative session and ready to put an end to the #TrumpShutdown.
Wishing everyone a peaceful and prosperous #NewYear!
