Rep. Sensenbrenner: Now seems like a good time to pass my #BUILDWALLAct, which would use assets seized from drug cartels, like El Chapo's, to build a physical barrier along the southern border.
This bipartisan legislation will hold these countries accountable for failing to cooperate adequately with our drug enforcement efforts. I’m grateful to Senators Toomey and Jones and Congressman Connolly for their leadership on this important bill.” 3/
Protecting our communities from illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues will require an all-hands-on-deck effort, including better cooperation from the foreign nations from which these deadly drugs are produced and trafficked into our country. 2/
Representative Sensenbrenner: “Americans are now more likely to die from opioid-related overdoses than from car accidents, and fentanyl is the drug most responsible for fatalities. 1/
Sensenbrenner, @GerryConnolly, @SenToomey, and @SenDougJones Redouble Effort to Fight Fentanyl Imports
The last two years were filled with many successes for the American people, and we must charge ahead to ensure security, restore liberty, and increase opportunity for all. “ #SOTU
Together, we must build upon that success and choose to push forward through partisan gridlock, reject unprincipled resistance, and restore civility and cooperation. 2/
"Just over a month ago, Congress and the President found a way to come together and pass historic, bipartisan criminal justice reform—the culmination of an effort I was proud to lead for over a decade.
Washington, D.C.–Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-05) offered the following statement after President Trump delivered his second State of the Union address:
POTUS: "... from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona... Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history." #SOTU
POTUS: Everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before. #SOTU
POTUS: "Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life.  And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth:  all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of God." #SOTU
This market-driven solution is estimated to save the American taxpayer billions of dollars and will make it easier for individuals to purchase more affordable prescriptions.” #CREATESAct
Earlier today, I introduced bipartisan legislation that would fight the anticompetitive practices of some pharmaceutical and biologic companies, allowing producers to bring generic drugs to market faster. 2/
Rep. Sensenbrenner on #SOTU: “Working to make generic drugs more widely available is one of my biggest goals during the 116th Congress. 1/
The American people deserve to be safe in our homes and communities, and I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle to work with us to that end.” 4/
I have supported efforts to beef up border security throughout my career and am proud to have reintroduced the BUILD WALL Act, which would divert money and assets seized from drug cartels to fund for our southern border. 3/
Experts agree that physical barriers, coupled with other technology-supported solutions, work and are needed. 2/
Rep. Sensenbrenner on #SOTU: “It’s imperative that Congress provide the much needed resources to secure our borders, cut off the flow of drugs and illegal immigration, and ensure the safety of the American people. 1/
#Tbt #CriminalJusticeReform #SOTU
Rather than promising to raise taxes on hardworking American families and businesses, I urge my Democratic colleagues to join our efforts in expanding prosperity for all.” 3/
There is no doubt that the Tax Cuts Jobs Act and the regulatory reforms passed in the last Congress have contributed to this robust economy that the American people deserve. 2/
Rep. Sensenbrenner on #SOTU: “Americans are reaping the benefits of our booming economy: economic growth is strong, unemployment rates are low, and consumer confidence is high. 1/

I’m proud to sponsor this common-sense bill that will implement market-based solutions, making prescription drugs more affordable, saving taxpayers money, and providing much-needed relief to the American people. 3/

I’m grateful to all of the witnesses, especially Dr. Timothy Westlake, who has been instrumental in my work on this issue. His expertise and passion have proven invaluable as we try to end the scourge of the opioid epidemic.”
This hearing gave members of the committee an opportunity to hear directly from subject matter experts about the next steps Congress should take to combat this public health crisis, including my Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues Act.
Rep. Sensenbrenner: “In addition to treating addiction, empowering law enforcement agents to stop the proliferation of dangerous opioids and synthetic opioids, like fentanyl and its analogues, is an important step to ending the opioid epidemic.
