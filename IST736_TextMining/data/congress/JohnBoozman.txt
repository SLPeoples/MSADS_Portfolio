Another terrific #VeteransHistoryProject interview recently conducted by my office features 98-year-old Thomas Vaughns of White Hall. He served as an airplane mechanic w/ the Tuskegee Airmen during WWII, a Supply Sgt. during Korea worked for the VA. He’s lived an amazing life.
As co-chair of the Senate @AirForce Caucus, I have thoroughly enjoyed working w/ @SecAFOfficial Heather Wilson to advance Air Force priorities. She's been a tireless advocate for Airmen their families and will certainly be missed. UTEP is fortunate to be gaining her leadership.

Very honored humbled to be @DAVHQ 2019 Outstanding Senate Legislator of the Year. Helping #veterans and their families is personal for me. This recognition furthers my drive to ensure America delivers on the promises we made them. #keepthepromiseMore:

ICYMI: Yesterday on the Senate floor I laid out how the #GreenNewDeal is a far-left wish list that will raise costs, expand government power and hurt Arkansans. What we need is an all-the-above energy approach that builds on progress we've already made to reduce carbon emissions.
@KathyLWebb Congratulations on this honor. We're thankful for the work @ARHungerRelief does and I have seen first-hand how far your efforts extend. Our partnership is important to me because we share the same goal of helping Arkansans. Well done keep up the good work.

Today marks 111 years since Ozark National Forest was designated as a national forest by presidential proclamation. It's a great showcase of Arkansas's natural beauty and landscape that draws natives and visitors alike in to explore and enjoy. @forestservice
Single moms, seniors and those living on fixed incomes—the very people that #GreenNewDeal supporters purport to help—will be the most negatively impacted by this proposal.
If you ask most Americans if government control over almost every aspect of their lives is the direction they want to see us take, the answer is an overwhelming no. Yet that's what the #GreenNewDeal seeks to do under the pretense of ending climate
WATCH��: I'll be speaking on the #GreenNewDeal along with my colleagues and laying out the costs associated with this plan and what it would mean for the average Arkansan. (Hint: the costs of this unrealistic wish list will have you seeing RED)

The @DeptVetAffairs has indicated its highest clinical priority is suicide prevention. With the alarming number of suicides in the #veteran community it absolutely must be. Having metrics to measure the effectiveness of VA’s mental health suicide prevention programs is vital.

While I’m disappointed with the result of today’s vote, I remain committed to fighting for those unable to fight for themselves will continue working to protect and uphold the sanctity of life. The #BornAlive Abortion Survivor Protection Act is common sense deserved to pass.

11-year old Ruby Kate from Harrison truly is a "Kid Hero." She saw a need, figured out a way to help and put her plan into action – raising over $60k to help meet basic needs and wants for the seniors she's befriended. We're incredibly proud
Arkansans representing @NatlHeadStart visited my office today to discuss the services they provide to children families in our state and to express their gratitude for having full-year funding in FY19. Enjoyed our meeting and the opportunity to stay updated.
Congratulations to two exceptional, hardworking AR students - Isabelle Sojas - on their selection as our state's 2019 @SenateYouth Program representatives. I look forward to meeting them in March. We're also very proud of our alternates, Jackson
I’m glad this group of postmasters from #Arkansas stopped by my office today for a meeting. I really appreciated visiting with them to hear what they are concerned about and would like federal policy makers to focus on. Thankful for the work they do for our state. #ARinDC

ICYMI: Last night I spoke about the #WEEEAct becoming law and expressed my confidence in @USAIDMarkGreen his team as they begin to implement it. I was honored to work on the bill and I'm excited about the possibilities for empowerment and prosperity for women around the world.
I’m speaking on the #Senate floor about legislation I introduced last Congress that was passed in December and signed into law earlier this month. Tune in to hear more about the #WEEEAct and its implementation. @usaid @USAIDMarkGreen
One of my former interns shared his experience as part of my team in Little Rock esp. what he learned about our efforts to promote the @librarycongress #VeteransHistoryProject. See what he had to say about our work to preserve AR #veterans' stories: …

@JLAngeline @GrayDCnews Thanks for having me. Looking forward to joining you again soon.
The announcement of an agreement to reopen the government and continue negotiations to deliver more resources to secure our border is a positive step. It’s time to act. We need border security and a funding agreement for the rest of FY19.My full statement:

Today we honor the life and legacy of #MLKJr
It is promising that President Trump has brought forward a proposal to reopen the government. I am hopeful this will bring congressional leaders to the table to negotiate so we can find a solution to end this uncertainty.
Since the Senate remains in session, I remain in Washington. That gave me an opportunity to share my support with  @March_for_Life participants as they made their way past the Capitol to the Supreme Court. Appreciate all who came out to stand up for life today. #whywemarch
.@USDA @SecretarySonny has announced some @usdafsa offices (including 27 in AR) will be open on 1/17, 1/18 and 1/22 for existing loan services other limited items. I encourage Arkansans in need of FSA assistance to utilize this opportunity. Full list
Congratulations to Gov. @AsaHutchinson and I look forward to four more years of his leadership and partnership to keep moving Arkansas in the right direction. #arpx
Congratulations @FarmBureau on your 100th anniversary. Nobody has done more to advocate on behalf of America's farmers ranchers. It's an honor to work alongside you to shape public policy to benefit your members which in turn benefits our entire country. #AFBF19 #AFBF100 @ArFB
This is welcome news and I was honored to play a small role in helping get this passed in the Senate and to the president’s desk. Job well done to @RepFrenchHill for helping preserve this resource for the benefit of Arkansans today and in the future.

This graphic, produced prior to yesterday's #WEEEAct signing, shows those members who had 4 or more pieces of legislation signed into law. For some perspective, only about 3% of all bills introduced were enacted. Looking forward to more hard work success in the 116th Congress.
.@nationaljournal recently ran the numbers on the legislative activity in the 115th Congress and I'm proud to say that six bills I sponsored have now been enacted. Of the 535 voting members of the House and Senate, only two members had more bills become law than I did.

I share @POTUS’ concern about the escalating #BorderCrisis. National security is the federal government’s #1 responsibility increasing resources for #border protection must accurately reflect this obligation. We can do this if everyone comes to the table.

It was a busy end to the 115th Congress, but there was a lot we accomplished that will help Arkansans.
He has been a colleague, friend and mentor who has served the state of KS and our nation’s ag community well. @SenPatRoberts' voice will be missed in the Senate when he retires in 2020. (2/2)
We would not have the 2018 farm bill w/o @SenPatRoberts’ leadership, commitment to the diverse needs of all producers and his unwavering dedication to see a fair and equitable bill through to completion. (1/2)
@POTUS signed the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act today bc there's no excuse for failing to fully deliver housing benefits that GI bill recipients are owed. Thank you to @SenBrianSchatz for support in holding @DeptVetAffairs accountable.
