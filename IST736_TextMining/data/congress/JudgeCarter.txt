This shift greatly increases the chance that investigations would result in outcomes that sided with the party in power, putting Americans’ right to freely express their political opinions in jeopardy.
Under H.R. 1 the Federal Election Commission (FEC) would go from a bipartisan 3-3 panel, with 4 votes required to investigate or prosecute, to a partisan 3-2 panel chaired by an appointee of the president, with 3 votes needed to investigate or prosecute.

Speaker Pelosi flat out refused to consider the President’s proposal, despite the fact that it would provide protections for DACA recipients, something Democrats have continually wanted in the past. They are more focused on obstructing than negotiating.
ALL Republicans voted FOR it. For the Democrats, it isn't about paying federal employees or reopening the government. Their unwillingness to negotiate shows that their only goal is to obstruct.
This vote would've paid all federal employees during the shutdown until a solution is reached...215 Democrats just voted AGAINST it.
By rejecting President Trump’s latest compromise without even making a counter offer, Nancy Pelosi has shown she’s not interested in negotiating to reopen the government. It is beyond time for Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats to come to the table to negotiate.

It’s past time for the Democrats to negotiate, provide funding for border security and reopen the government.
Democrats have made it clear that they are unwilling to negotiate, despite evidence of a growing crisis at the border. Law enforcement professionals need resources to do their job, including a barrier, to slow down illegal border crossings, so they can apprehend individuals.
