Stopping federal funding for California’s high speed rail boondoggle and redirecting it to overdue water storage projects is a win for taxpayers and a win for California’s future.
MarketWatch: At a 10-year high, wage growth for American workers likely to keep accelerating
Democrats in the House voted down an amendment today stating the importance of only allowing American citizens to vote in our elections. When did protecting the democratic rights of American citizens become a partisan issue?
I joined Rep.  Napolitano today in introducing the Building Success for Youth ChalleNGe Act, H.R. 1638, to support the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program. Read more about this life changing effort here:
House Democrats just passed a “welfare for politicians” bill that will allow their campaigns to robo-call you with taxpayer dollars. They are sending your tax dollars to their campaigns rather than building new roads or investing in cancer research.
I voted against H.R. 1, or the Democrat Politician Protection Act as it should be called, because it's a poorly disguised attack on free and fair elections in our country. Read my full statement here:
Republican economic policies continue to fuel job growth and increase the size of the American workforce.
Proud to cosponsor the RAILWAY Act which repurposes funding from the most wasteful project in CA's history (high speed rail) and invests it into some of our most critical water storage projects. That’s a win for taxpayers and a win for California’s future.
In a Defense Appropriations hearing today w/ the Commander of the U.S. European Command, Gen. Curtis M. Scaparrotti, I raised my concerns re: the growing military strength of Russia its use of disinformation cyber tactics to disrupt the development of democratic institutions.
The top legislative priority of the new Dem majority in the House is a bill (H.R. 1) that forces states to allow felons to vote, even those convicted of voter fraud, and creates a mechanism that will use tax dollars to fund their re-election campaigns. That’s their top priority?
I want to thank everyone at @US_EUCOM for their participation in this exercise and their contributions in strengthening our strategic partnership with Israel.
Some have asked why I oppose ballot harvesting. I believe having unknown individuals, including paid campaign operatives, handle collect hundreds or thousands of ballots with no transparency is ripe for voter fraud. I want everyone to vote in a secure and transparent manner.

Democrats on the House Rules Committee voted last night to kill my amendment to H.R. 1 prohibiting ballot harvesting. Speaker Pelosi and CA Democrats are doing everything they can to protect ballot harvesting regardless of the fraud it invites into our elections.
The Democrat Caucus in the House is having a divisive internal fight over things like condemning anti-Semitism, embracing socialism, and killing massive job creating projects. Stop and think about how out of touch they are with American families and values.
Our elections don’t need a massive injection of your tax dollars paying for ads and consultants. And we certainly don’t need to restrict speech.
Anti-Semitic remarks have no place anywhere – including the U.S. House of Representatives.
If H.R. 1 becomes law, when someone gives Speaker Pelosi’s campaign $200, the federal government is going to send Speaker Pelosi’s campaign a check for $1,200 from taxpayers. That’s wrong.
When unknown third parties are handling hundreds or thousands of ballots with no transparency voters are understandably concerned.
As we've seen, the practice of ballot harvesting is ripe for voter fraud. I have just sent a letter to the Riverside County Registrar of Voters seeking clarity on how it's interpreting the ballot harvesting law passed by CA Democrats. Read the letter here:
If you aren’t already, I’d encourage you to follow me on Instagram. Mostly for the photos of Cali, our office dog.
Democrats have made no secret about what’s on their agenda...between a $90 trillion socialist takeover of our economy and a $30 trillion plan to eliminate private health insurance, everyone of their ideas would take power from the people and give it to power brokers in D.C.
Let’s be clear – H.R. 1 isn’t about restoring “fairness” in our elections. It’s designed to rig the game to benefit Democrats. And it’s from the same playbook Democrats have used in Sacramento by legalizing the fraud inviting practice of ballot harvesting.
Congratulations to everyone at @SpaceX! Your hard work and ingenuity has brought our nation one step closer to returning to human space flight.
Democrats are bringing a bill to the floor (H.R. 1) that could divert more than $1 BIL in tax dollars to their campaigns. It’s outrageous to take these tax dollars away from research for deadly diseases, veterans or paying down the nat'l debt to fund their re-election campaigns.
Even a scaled down version of the bullet train boondoggle doesn’t pencil out. The sooner we stop spending tax dollars on this project, the sooner we can ensure our tax dollars are going to real transportation solutions.

H.R. 1, a bill Congressional Dems claim would restore “fairness” in our elections, would send YOUR tax dollars to the campaign accounts of candidates you may not support. For every $1 (up to $200) contributed to Speaker Pelosi’s campaign, she’s going to receive $6 from Uncle Sam.
It’s pretty rare for the minority party in the House to have its Motion to Recommit (a last ditch attempt to amend a bill) approved. I’m glad Republicans broke that trend today to send a strong message combating anti-Semitism at home and abroad.
Support for government run health care plummets when people understand it’d require a middle-class tax hike and they’d have to give up their private health insurance. The better path is to make our existing health care system more affordable and improve access.

There’s bipartisan support for physical barriers, walls, fences along our border. The range of funding we are negotiating over is a small fraction of our federal budget. We should avoid this brinkmanship and come to a compromise that secures our border and keeps the gov’t open.
