Our Majority is committed to passing legislation to empower women across the country. This month, we will pass the #PaycheckFairness Act to help ensure #EqualPayForEqualWork. I also look forward to bringing legislation to the Floor in April that reauthorizes #VAWA.
As we celebrate #IWD2019, I join in paying tribute to the women who have worked to advance the causes of justice, equality, opportunity. I am proud to serve alongside @HouseDemWomen, including our dynamic diverse new Members, who are making history.

I’m live on Facebook with @RepSarbanes to discuss how #HR1 will protect and restore voting rights, get dark money out of politics, and make sure public officials are working #ForthePeople. Tune in:
Happy birthday to my friend, new Member, and a powerful voice for #AZ09 on @HouseJudiciary, @RepGregStanton.
.@POTUS @HouseGOP ought to work with Dems to ensure that our economic policies benefit all Americans and restore certainty for entrepreneurs and job-creators.  With passage of #HR1, Dems have already taken steps to make government work again #ForThePeople.
Today’s report makes clear the long-term pitfalls of the #GOPtaxscam. Moreover, the 35 day Trump-McConnell shutdown continues to have a detrimental effect.  We have also seen a record-breaking $891 billion trade deficit, proof of President Trump’s deeply flawed economic policies.
February’s #JobsReport, which shows a significant slowing of the pace of private sector job growth, ought to alarm a nation already facing profound economic uncertainty. 
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a champion for #NJ05, @RepJoshG. Thank you for your commitment to bipartisan solutions as co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus.
Honored to join @BillClinton @ChrisVanHollen in celebrating our good friend Senate President Mike Miller last night in Annapolis. Throughout his career, Mike has been a steadfast leader advocate for Maryland’s families.

Today, I will vote for a resolution condemning anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, including Islamophobia and white nationalism.  We must reject centuries-old tropes of dual loyalty based on race, faith, or origin and recognize that we are all each other's fellow Americans.
I thank @RepKarenBass for introducing a #VAWA reauthorization today, a major priority for the Dem-led House. Once @HouseJudiciary has completed its markup, I look forward to bringing it to the Floor for a vote during the first week of April. #VAWA4ALL

.@HouseGOP jammed their #GOPTaxScam through Congress claiming the tax cuts would pay for themselves, but this @WashingtonPost article walks through the deeply harmful impact of the law on our nation’s long-term fiscal outlook.
The House will no longer ignore the critical need for paid family leave. I was proud to join @RepMaloney, @RepDonBeyer, @RepWexton advocates to introduce the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act to provide 12 wks of paid family leave for federal employees.
It is appalling that Defense Dept officials would present misleading assertions to justify @POTUS' discriminatory #TransMilitaryBan, which denies us the service of talented, patriotic Americans undermines national security. The Admin must correct the record. #ProtectTransTroops

I pray that those affected by the tornadoes in AL will be comforted over the coming weeks by the concern and aid of their fellow Americans.  I urge the Administration to take every measure necessary to help those families and communities affected.
I am saddened by the devastation brought by deadly tornadoes in Alabama over the weekend.  My thoughts are with the families who lost loved ones and endured destruction of their homes and businesses. 
I was honored to participate in a wreath laying ceremony at the @SPLCenter Civil Rights Memorial as part of the #FPICivilRights pilgrimage and join in paying tribute to those lost during the Civil Rights Movement and those who continue to fight for equal justice under the law.
This morning, I joined my colleagues in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in honor of #Selma54, when our brothers and sisters, including my dear friend @RepJohnLewis, attempted to march from Selma to Montgomery to register to vote and were met with violence. #FPICivilRights
Happy birthday to my friend, @RosaDeLauro. Thank you for your leadership commitment to #PaycheckFairness ensuring women receive #EqualPayForEqualWork. I look forward to bringing this legislation to the Floor following committee consideration.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and a tireless advocate for increasing access to quality, affordable health care for #CA07 and across the country, @RepBera.
Our next stop on the #FPICivilRights Pilgrimage was a visit to @legacymuseum in Montgomery, AL. This new museum and memorial features exhibits on our nation’s history of racial inequality, the Civil Rights Movement, and America’s prison system.
I’m on the @FaithNPolitics #FPICivilRights Pilgrimage, which began with a visit to 16th Street Baptist Church where we reflected on the horrific bombing that killed 4 innocent girls. We heard from @RepTerriSewell, Pastor Price, and saw a moving performance led by local students.
We will reauthorize #VAWA, empower women around the world, promote gender equality. This #WomensHistoryMonth, we honor the heroes of the fight for women’s suffrage on its centenary, recommit to the work of eliminating barriers to full participation in our democracy economy.
Together, we continue the work of expanding opportunities combatting discrimination exclusion. I look forward to working w the @HouseDemWomen our colleagues to take action to help ensure #EqualPay, affordable access to health care, advancement of women girls in STEM.
As we commemorate #WomensHistoryMonth, there is much to celebrate.  This year, the #116thCongress convened with women representing 102 districts across the country in the House with 25 women serving in the Senate, the most ever in our nation’s history. 
Next week, House Democrats will be one step closer to restoring Americans’ faith in government by passing #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. @RulesDemocrats will meet on Tuesday to advance this bill, and I look forward to bringing it to the Floor later in the week.
I join @HouseForeign Chair @RepEliotEngel in expressing my concern over the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan as a result of a Pakistan-based terrorist group’s brutal attack. I urge both countries to deescalate mounting tensions.
I am specifically concerned that @POTUS took Chairman Kim at his word when he claimed innocence in the brutal death of U.S. citizen Otto Warmbier; such statements dishonor this young man’s memory and cause further pain to his grieving family.
The @WhiteHouse should brief Members of Congress on what transpired between @POTUS and Chairman Kim in Hanoi.  I am concerned this is another example of the White House hiding from Congress what the President communicated to a foreign adversary.
Today, @realDonaldTrump learned an important lesson about diplomacy. Negotiations with foreign tyrants cannot be undertaken without substantial preparation, and they cannot be reduced to optics.  #HanoiSummit
Tune in as @HouseJudiciary holds a hearing on @POTUS’ #FakeEmergency and how it violates the Constitution. The House has passed a resolution this week to terminate the declaration, and I urge the Senate GOP to stand up for the Constitution and pass it.
I thank @RepRoybalAllard, @NydiaVelazquez, and @RepYvetteClarke for their work to introduce #HR6, the Dream and Promise Act to protect #DREAMers and those with #TPS and #DED. I look forward to bringing this bill to the Floor following introduction and committee consideration.

Today was a good day for America. House Democrats passed #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, which will help end the epidemic of #gunviolence in our country. I urge the Senate to take up and pass this legislation without delay. #NeverAgain
Democrats are taking action today–not another moment of silence, but action to #EndGunViolence. Many districts have been painfully affected by gun violence, including #MD05. Let us pass #HR8. Let the Senate pass it @POTUS sign it. Let's make an effort to stop the carnage.
The House will vote soon on #HR8 to expand background checks. I'm grateful that Marylanders who lost family members to gun violence and advocates joined me to watch debate from the House Gallery.  We will honor the memories of their loved ones with action.
No one should go to school, work, a movie theater, church, or any other public space and fear for their life. This action by the House is the first step we will take to address this crisis. We cannot sit idly by as more Americans are killed by gun violence.
I will be thinking of John McNamara, Wendi Winters, Rebecca Smith, Rob Hiaasen, and Gerald Fischman, reporters, editors, and newspaper staff who were brutally murdered in the newsroom of @capgaznews in Annapolis in June 2018.
I will be thinking of Jaelynn Willey, a bright young woman from St. Mary’s County in #MD05 who was killed at Great Mills High School in March 2018.
I will be thinking of Sylvia Frasier, Kenneth Proctor, and Frank Kohler, three #MD05 constituents who were tragically murdered at the Washington Navy Yard shooting in September 2013.
Today, the House will take historic action to prevent gun violence by passing H.R. 8, requiring background checks on all firearm sales. When I vote for this bill, I will be thinking of the thousands of Marylanders we’ve tragically lost to gun violence.
Today, @RosaDeLauro and @AppropsDems are holding a critically important hearing on the Trump Admin’s family separation policy. The Admin must #EndFamilySeparation and #ReuniteEveryChild, and we ought to ensure all migrants are treated with dignity and respect.
I thank @HouseBudgetDems for holding a hearing on the ongoing negative impacts of the #GOPTaxScam, which added $1.9 trillion to the deficit and gave 83% of the tax cuts to the top 1%. This bill was a handout to the wealthiest Americans and left middle-class families behind.

President Trump has declared a #FakeEmergency in an attempt to accomplish what he could not through the legislative process. RT if you agree that’s not how democracy works.
GOP lawmakers in the House and Senate ought to take a look at what Senator Rand Paul has said about the President’s decision to disregard our Constitution with his #FakeEmergency:

House Republicans ought to listen to the chorus of voices in the GOP, including Senator Mike Lee, who are denouncing President Trump’s #FakeEmergency. I urge the GOP to join Dems in voting for today’s resolution to terminate the declaration.
Republicans and Democrats alike do not agree with @realDonaldTrump’s decision to declare a #FakeEmergency. Read what other GOP lawmakers are saying about it here: 
I agree with GOP Senator Ron Johnson: @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeEmergency is not in line with how executive power was used in the past, nor how it ought to be used today. I urge Republicans to join House Dems in terminating this declaration. Read more:
IN HIS OWN WORDS: @realDonaldTrump admits that he didn’t need to declare a #FakeEmergency. RT if you agree @HouseGOP should put the Constitution before their party and join House Democrats in voting to terminate his unconstitutional declaration.
If any Member cares about upholding the Constitution, he or she should vote for @JoaquinCastroTX’s resolution to terminate @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeEmergency. They should vote their conscience for the Constitution, not party politics.
Senator Chuck Grassley is one of many Republicans who disagree w @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeEmergency. I hope my GOP colleagues will join w House Dems today to pass a resolution terminating his declaration. Take a look at others opposed to the declaration:
GOP Senator Pat Toomey has said that @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeEmergency is not a good idea. He’s not alone - countless GOP lawmakers have spoken out against the declaration. @HouseGOP should vote with Dems today to terminate it. Read more here:
GOP Senator Lamar Alexander sums up exactly why we should oppose the #FakeEmergency that @POTUS declared. I urge Republicans to heed Senator Alexander’s words and vote with Dems to terminate the declaration today.

I opened my press conference this morning by discussing today’s vote on @JoaquinCastrotx’s resolution to terminate @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeEmergency. I hope @HouseGOP votes for the Constitution and their conscience, not politics and their party.
I recently met a mother who was separated from her daughters for 4 months. It was a heartbreaking reminder of the pain inflicted by the Trump Admin’s policies. I stand with @HispanicCaucus in demanding answers from the Admin on how families will be reunited. #EndFamilySeparation
Tomorrow, the House will vote on @HispanicCaucus Chair @JoaquinCastrotx’s resolution to terminate @POTUS’ #FakeEmergency declaration. This is about upholding our constitutional system I hope every Member votes not for party, but for our democracy.

Once again, @RealDonaldTrump is pandering to an extreme base, jeopardizing the health of millions by punishing those who choose to provide the full range of reproductive care using other, non-federal funding. I will continue to oppose these efforts.
The Admin’s decision to impose restrictions on medical advice that health care providers share puts millions at risk. @PPFA health centers that receive #TitleX funding serve millions of women families by providing health screenings basic services.
I'm in #CA51 today with @RepJuanVargas to visit a migrant shelter and receive a briefing on the services that are provided to migrants at the facility. We also heard firsthand how the Admin's policies are making it more difficult for migrants fleeing violence to seek refuge.

Appreciated the opportunity to meet with @PGCPS Interim CEO Dr. Monica Goldson this afternoon to learn about her priorities for students in #MD05 discuss how we can continue to work together to ensure students have the tools they need to succeed.
A number of Republican Senators and House Members are already rebuking President Trump’s decision. They’re calling the move, “unwise,” a “bad idea," and “a mistake.” Read more here: RT if you oppose @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeNationalEmergency.
Here’s a look at just how deeply unpopular this #FakeNationalEmergency is with the American people. 6-in-10 Americans don't believe there is an emergency at the southern border nearly 60% of Americans think Trump is misusing his presidential power.
.@POTUS also undermined his argument for his costly and ineffective border wall by admitting he “didn’t need to do this.” #FakeNationalEmergency
There is no crisis at the border. I traveled there with House Democrats just two weeks ago, and we heard from CBP, immigration advocates, and migrant families. It’s clear there are security and humanitarian challenges, but no crisis. #FakeNationalEmergency
.@RealDonaldTrump’s #FakeNationalEmergency is irresponsible, violates the Constitution, and makes America less safe. House Democrats are looking at every legislative and legal option to respond.
Pleased to attend today's groundbreaking ceremony at the New Outpatient Clinic at the Charlotte Hall Veterans Home. This facility is long overdue, and I look forward to the day when it can begin serving Southern Marylanders.

I thank my colleague @DavidCicilline for reintroducing the long-overdue assault weapons ban in the 116th Congress. I’m proud to join as an original co-sponsor of this commonsense, bipartisan measure to #EndGunViolence keep Americans safe. #EnoughIsEnough
Dems will use every tool at our disposal to protect our Constitution, our laws, our system of checks balances.  We will also take action to keep migrant families together, #ProtectDREAMers those with #TPS, push for comprehensive immigration reform.
I visited the border in TX NM last week can attest that there is no crisis or emergency of the kind @POTUS alleges.  Declaring a national emergency, as I have stated, would be a violation of the spirit of our laws run counter to our constitutional principles.
Tonight, the House voted to keep government open serving the American people as well as to improve the security of our borders with smart strategic investments. It is now up to @realDonaldTrump to sign it remove the threat of another #TrumpShutdown.
Pleased to stand with @chelliepingree my House Dem colleagues to introduce legislation to stop the relocation of hundreds of federal employees, which would be extremely disruptive to the mission of @USDA.
I was at the border last week can verify that no emergency exists there. @POTUS' decision to declare an emergency is a dangerous ploy. The House will vote for the conf report to keep govt open, but Dems will challenge this irresponsible declaration.
Feliz cumpleaños to my friend, @RepShalala, a great new Member from #FL27 and a longtime champion for access to affordable, quality health care for all Americans.

I am troubled, though not surprised, by the news that our national debt just reached a historic high. @POTUS has proven to be one of the worst presidents in terms of fiscal irresponsibility after exploding the deficit w his #GOPTaxScam, which gives 83% of benefits to the top 1%.
Today, I spoke in support of @RepRoKhanna’s war powers resolution that would require U.S. forces to end involvement in hostilities in #Yemen. It is time for Congress to make clear to the Admin that it cannot keep our Yemen policy on auto pilot while the situation deteriorates.

Tomorrow marks 1 year #SinceParkland, I thank @HouseJudiciary Dems for marking up #HR8 #HR1112—to close background check loopholes for gun sales. Following committee consideration, I’m committed to bringing this overdue legislation to the Floor to #EndGunViolence. #NeverAgain
Finally, the House will vote on a war powers resolution today. #Yemen is a humanitarian crisis the status quo is not working. Two amendments were made in order, allowing for open, transparent debate on the House Floor.
I also said House Dems intend to bring legislation to the Floor soon to #ProtectDREAMers #SaveTPS. We also want to pass comprehensive immigration reform, which will require both parties working together. I urge Republicans to partner w Dems to fix our broken immigration system.
I told reporters I believe the conference report is a reasonable compromise, which is being finalized and I expect to bring to the Floor tomorrow. I thank @NitaLowey @RepRoybalAllard for their work. Another #TrumpShutdown is not an option.
I opened my weekly press conference by discussing my #DemsAtTheBorder trip with @RepEscobar, @RepTorresSmall, @RepDebHaaland, @RepMGS. Our conclusion: there is not a crisis at the border. There are challenges that require a mix of solutions, including technology personnel.

I joined my colleagues on the House steps to pay my respects to my dear friend, John Dingell, as he drove past the House, an institution he cared about so deeply. We will miss him, and our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with @RepDebDingell in the coming days.
Read my statement with @HouseForeign Chairman @RepEliotEngel on the situation in #Venezuela in advance of testimony tomorrow from U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams other @StateDept witnesses.
This #BlackHistoryMonth, I join in celebrating the 110th anniversary of @NAACP. For over a century, the NAACP has stood as the foremost civil rights org, working to advance opportunities, safeguard civil rights, ensure equal justice under the law. #TheWorkContinues #FoundersDay
Pleased to have the opportunity to meet with @KMorrisJr, the great-great-great grandson of Frederick Douglass, @UofMaryland Professor Mark Leone to learn more about the important life and legacy of Douglass, a great American and son of MD.
This weekend, I visited TX NM with @RepEscobar, @RepTorresSmall, @RepDebHaaland, @RepMGS to get the facts about our challenges at the border. Read press coverage of our #DemsAtTheBorder trip here:
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend and new Member, @RepGilCisneros. America #CA39 hit the jackpot when you were elected! I know you will be a great advocate for your fellow veterans active-duty military as a member of @VetAffairsDems and @HASCDemocrats.
This is the President of the United States bragging about forcing 800,000 Americans to miss two paychecks and costing the economy $11 billion.
Who is holding a campaign rally right now? And who is working at the Capitol to reach agreement to secure our borders and prevent another shutdown?
House Democrats are working to deliver #ForThePeople, holding hearings on protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, #HR1, and legislation to #EndGunViolence, #ActOnClimate, rebuild infrastructure. RT to spread the word.
Democrats are committed to reaching an agreement on border security and preventing another Trump shutdown by the Friday deadline. Watch my discussion on @MeetThePress Daily about ongoing negotiations and how another #TrumpShutdown is not an option.
Shutting down the government is not an option. Following my trip to the border, I joined @TeamCavuto to discuss reaching an agreement on border security and preventing another #TrumpShutdown. #DemsAtTheBorder
.@realDonaldTrump is in El Paso tonight to divide demagogue to make his case for his ineffective border wall. But the facts do not show the need for a wall. I know that because I traveled to the border to seek the facts. Read more: #DemsAtTheBorder
#OnThisDay in 1990, #NelsonMandela left prison a free man after serving 27 years. I had a deeply moving experience visiting his prison cell in South Africa 3 years ago. This #BlackHistoryMonth, we honor his legacy by working to advance the causes of equality justice for all.
Anti-Semitism must be called out, confronted, and condemned whenever it is encountered, without exception. Read my statement with House Democratic leadership on the comments of Congresswoman Ilhan Omar:
I was saddened to learn of the passing of my friend Rep. Walter Jones. We may have stood on opposite sides of the aisle, but I always respected his amiability, candor, love of country. I join in conveying my sympathies to his wife Jo Ann their family.
I just visited the border this weekend we need technology, port infrastructure, personnel, humanitarian assistance to secure our borders. Dems will continue to oppose funding for a costly and unnecessary wall that does not make us safer or address humanitarian challenges.
Acting White House Chief of Staff Mulvaney’s comments today were irresponsible alarming. Instead of threatening another #TrumpShutdown, the Admin ought to reassure federal employees, their families, Americans that another shutdown is off the table.
Wishing a happy birthday to my friend, and a powerful voice for the First State on @EnergyCommerce, @RepLBR.
RT @RepEscobar: In order to create smart and humane border public policy, we must understand as much as possible about the border. Thank…
While Democrats were at the border yesterday to listen and find effective solutions to the challenges we face, I am disappointed @realDonaldTrump is heading to El Paso tomorrow for a campaign rally to demagogue and divide.

Following our #DemsAtTheBorder trip to Texas and New Mexico, I joined @NPRWeekend to discuss what we heard from advocates, migrant communities, and border patrol about their needs. Listen here:
I joined @CNN last night to discuss my trip to the border. Securing the border presents challenges, but it is not a crisis that demands a wall. We need smart strategic border security investments and policies that treat migrants with dignity and respect. #DemsAtTheBorder
I joined @RepEscobar, @RepTorresSmall, @RepDebHaaland, @RepMGS for a press conference to discuss our day meeting with migrants, advocates, and border law enforcement officials. #DemsAtTheBorder
We concluded our briefing with @CBP at an area called Monument Three. I thank the officials for answering our questions about how we can effectively address challenges at the border. Dems will continue to advocate for strategic investments to secure the border. #DemsAtTheBorder
We visited the site where a child migrant, Felipe Alonzo-Gomez, was apprehended. He later died in the Administration’s custody. We must ensure the safety of children seeking refuge in our country. #DemsAtTheBorder #JusticeforFelipe
We’re touring sites along the border with @CBP officials, including the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry. What we have seen confirms we need smart, strategic investments to strengthen border security and provide humanitarian assistance. #DemsAtTheBorder
