@VP @realDonaldTrump The only thing being manufactured is Democrats arguing there is no crisis at the border.  Why?  They don’t want to recognize Trump as the legitimate president. Democrats’ refusal to acknowledge the problems and crisis at our southern border is pure political hypocrisy.
@VP In fact, Democrats agreed and were willing to spend billions to fix it.  That was their position, grounded in fact; at least until @realDonaldTrump became President.
@VP For years I have worked across the aisle and with any willing participant to reform immigration.  During this time, I never heard any Democrat – in either the Senate or House of Representatives – say there was NOT a crisis at our southern border.
@VP In 2014, President Obama declared a humanitarian crisis at our southern border because 120,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended.  As of today, we have already apprehended 120,000 in Fiscal Year 2019.  The problems of 2014 are only getting worse.

I stand firmly behind President @realDonaldTrump’s decision to use executive powers to build the wall-barriers we desperately need.

Speaking at the First Monday Club in Greenville.WATCH:
@realDonaldTrump Republicans need to get behind President Trump emergency declaration to build wall/barrier.  Looking like he has no other option.
House Democrats’ border barrier/wall offer is PATHETIC. I hoped that Democrats would make good faith effort to strike a deal on border barrier/wall, DACA, and TPS. Unfortunately, it seems they hate @realDonaldTrump more than they want to solve problems.
It’s a bad deal for America when Russia cheats and the United States complies.

My questions and full letter to the FBI Director about the tactics used in the arrest of Roger Stone.
Although I am sure these tactics would be standard procedure for the arrest of a violent offender, I have questions regarding their necessity in this case.
.....I am leery that a subject of the Special Counsel’s investigation, who had retained counsel, had publicly stated that he believed that he would at some point be indicted, and was apparently willing to surrender voluntarily, was arrested in a pre-dawn raid at his home.
However, while I firmly support law enforcement taking into account threats to officer safety, flight risk, and the need to ensure evidence is preserved.....
Since his appointment, I have supported Special Counsel Mueller’s ability to conduct his investigation without interference.  Moreover, I have always been a strong admirer and supporter of the FBI.
5) Did anyone at the FBI, DOJ, or the Special Counsel's office alert CNN, any other media outlet, or anyone outside of law enforcement that the arrest was going to occur on the morning of January 25, 2019?
4) Did the Special Counsel's office issue a press release and release the indictment to the press prior to informing Mr. Stone’s attorneys of the arrest?
3) Were usual procedures for obtaining and executing arrest and search warrants followed with regard to Mr. Stone?
2) Was the manner of Mr. Stone's arrest consistent with the arrests of, and procedures for the arrests of, similarly charged individuals?
Today I wrote to the FBI about the arrest of Roger Stone.  My questions include:1) Why was it necessary to arrest Mr. Stone at his home in the early morning hours, rather than working through his attorneys to permit him to surrender voluntarily?
To do otherwise would be to encourage more illegal immigration.  President @realDonaldTrump has been more than reasonable.  The ball is now in the Democrats’ court.
I suggest my Democratic colleagues make a good faith effort to solve this problem before it is too late. * TPS program is going to be canceled unless reformed. * DACA population won’t get legal status unless we address some of the causes of a broken immigration system.
Last time I checked, the President of the United States is a stakeholder in the legislative process.  To suggest he ‘stay out’ is a sure way for failure. 
@realDonaldTrump I’m hopeful we can reach a deal between President Trump and Congress, which would be the best way forward.
@realDonaldTrump Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump have all sent troops to help secure the border in the past.  What’s the difference between troops securing the border and troops constructing barriers to secure the border?
@realDonaldTrump Question: Can states ask federal government to help secure a broken border that is allowing harm to be done to their states?
If White House and Congress fail to reach a deal then President @realDonaldTrump must act through emergency powers to build wall/barrier.
Hope Congress - in a bipartisan fashion - will work with the President and take advantage of this moment.  Last best chance to take a major step toward fixing broken borders and a broken immigration system. Thank you Mr. President.  Let’s make this a win-win for America!
I strongly urge my Democratic colleagues to work with the White House on a 3 week CR that includes a down payment on wall/barrier funding consistent with DHS priorities.
The way forward is clear: * 3 week CR that includes a down payment on wall/barrier funding and Democratic priorities for disaster relief showing good faith from both sides.
@AOC Question: Is it possible Rep. Ocasio-Cortez could be wrong about the demise of the planet in 12 years and the American people reject her socialist agenda in 2020?  Stay tuned!

Let’s bury the hatchet and enjoy the next 12 years because they are going to be our last, right?
Democrats all-encompassing hatred of President @realDonaldTrump and unwillingness to work with him -– on things that matter to the American people –- will be one of the chief reasons he gets reelected.
Mr. President, Your decision to take the high road regarding @SpeakerPelosi's petty denial of your ability to deliver the State of the Union in the House chamber will serve you well over time.
Speaking with @FoxNews @seanhannity tonight at 9:15 pm about @SpeakerPelosi not inviting President @realDonaldTrump to deliver the State of the Union address.Tune in!
@realDonaldTrump Speaker Pelosi’s decision to ignore this long-standing American tradition is absurd, petty, and shameful.  The judgement of history will NOT be kind.
@realDonaldTrump The State of the Union is a tradition which has been carried out during times of war and peace, turmoil and tranquility.  It is an important piece of our history and government.
@realDonaldTrump The President – regardless of party – should have the opportunity to address the American people in the State of the Union address from the traditional venue of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Speaker Pelosi's decision not to invite President @realDonaldTrump to deliver the State of the Union address sets a new low for American politics.  
Mr. President, you and your administration have risen to this historic moment.  Stand Firm.
By standing with the people of Venezuela, President Trump stands for freedom.  Strong American leadership is indispensable in moments like this.  History will record that the Trump Administration was on the side of the people yearning to be free -- not with their oppressor.

@realDonaldTrump The government is now shut down because Democrats refuse to work with President Trump — even after a reasonable offer was made.  Very sad and disappointing.
@realDonaldTrump To reject this offer — Out of Hand — tells me that it is not about the quality of the proposal, but Democrats' desire for President Trump to fail.

President Trump denying Speaker Pelosi military travel to visit our troops in Afghanistan, our allies in Egypt and NATO is also inappropriate.
