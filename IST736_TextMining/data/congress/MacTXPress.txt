"We have certainly had terrorist attacks here and abroad, but I also think it is important that we pay tribute to our military, intelligence community, and law enforcement for the remarkable success that they have had in the years since 9/11."

Yesterday, the House passed H.R. 801, the “Route 66 National Historic Trail Designation Act,” which designates Route 66 as a National Historic Trail. This stretch of highway has served an important role in supporting our district’s economy for many years.
