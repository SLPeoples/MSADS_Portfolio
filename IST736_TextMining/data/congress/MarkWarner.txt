Glad to see that @VDSS is working to provide some relief to SNAP beneficiaries in our Commonwealth who were affected by the 35-day government shutdown.
President Trump’s junk plans will increase families' out-of-pocket costs and weaken protections for folks with pre-existing conditions. That's why I’ve introduced legislation to block this move and protect affordable health care for all Americans.
So our miners lose their benefits after a lifetime of hard work? It's not right. And it's why we need to pass the American Miners Act to protect their healthcare and pensions now more than ever.

People are starting to recognize that social media and other online services aren’t free. Our data is worth something, and we deserve much more transparency from these platform companies when it comes to the value of user data.
Shutdowns don’t just hurt federal employees. More than 1/3 of small businesses were affected as well during the longest shutdown in
The President is terrified about where Congress' and Mueller's investigations may lead. We’ll let the facts speak for themselves when the final reports come out.

Startling new numbers from the shutdown:- 62% of federal workers depleted all or most of their savings- 42% took on debt- 25% tapped their retirement accounts- 25% visited a food
Looks like we have a bipartisan deal. The President should sign it. If he doesn’t, Congress should override his veto. No more shutdowns.
I have many concerns about Mr. Barr's nomination, but what troubles me most is the President’s reason for choosing him. I'll be on the Senate floor shortly to discuss why I oppose confirming an AG who auditioned for the job by attacking Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation.

It's deeply disappointing to the hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors across the Commonwealth and the country who are once again bracing for the worst.
Unfortunately, what the American people got was more of the same partisan fear-mongering and one-sided demands.
What I had hoped to hear from the President tonight was ​a plan to make sure our government stays up and running ten days from now, and a willingness to work with Congress to make sure that a shutdown never happens again.
I’m here with my #SOTU guest, Cheryl, a federal worker who was harmed by the shutdown. I hope the President will talk tonight about how he plans to help the federal workers and contractors who are struggling to recover financially and what his plan is to avoid another shutdown.
A classified report and a short press release with no details isn’t nearly good enough. We need more transparency on how our democracy is being targeted by our adversaries. The public deserves an unclassified version of this report. 
This is something that I'm afraid is getting lost in the shutdown debate. A lot of federal contractors are people with disabilities, and they are truly suffering after missing two paychecks.
Federal workers and contractors can’t afford another shutdown, and I want to make sure we keep in mind that it’s folks like Cheryl who will suffer if the President shuts down the government again.
My #SOTU guest tonight is Cheryl Nazar, a nurse at the Federal Correctional Institution in Petersburg. She’s one of the many Virginians whose family faced financial hardships because of the government shutdown.

The media didn’t make the President wake up on Wednesday and trash the intelligence community on Twitter. No tweet or Oval Office photo-op can undo two years of the President’s total disrespect for the intelligence community.
For federal contractors who missed a month of paychecks, the shutdown nightmare is hardly over. We’ve got to get these folks their back pay.
The Russian playbook is out there. Platforms must constantly be on the lookout for bad actors, particularly foreign adversaries abusing these platforms to spread misinformation and disinformation.
It’s not just that Facebook paid people, including teens as young as 13, to hand over *all* of their data. It’s how they used that data. $FB needs to commit to more transparency on *everything* it is collecting and exactly how much it’s worth.
I introduced a bill last week called the “Stop STUPIDITY Act” that would end government shutdowns once and for all. I don’t care what you call the bill, but we need to make sure some sort of language preventing future shutdowns makes it into the final border security deal.
The President has a dangerous habit of undermining the intelligence community to fit his alternate reality. People risk their lives for the intelligence he just tosses aside on Twitter.
This is a breakthrough for a lot of veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange and other chemicals but denied their benefits on a technicality. These veterans fought just as hard, risked just as much, and deserve to get the benefits they earned.

Another missed paycheck for 800,000 federal employees today. The workers I’ve been talking to say bills are piling up and stress is mounting as they try to make ends meet. We need the President to reopen the government while we negotiate a bipartisan border security deal.
I expect that we will learn more about Mr. Stone’s campaign role, his communications regarding Wikileaks, and who else knew about Stone’s efforts. It remains essential that the Special Counsel be permitted to finish this work without any political interference.
It appears Mr. Stone also lied to Congress and tampered with witnesses in order to obstruct these investigations into the Trump campaign – yet another example of senior Trump officials concealing the truth about their Russia-related contacts during the 2016 election.
And, he publicly claimed on several occasions to remain in regular contact with then-candidate Trump throughout the 2016 presidential race, even after he formally departed the Trump campaign.
Roger Stone and Donald Trump have known each other for nearly forty years. Mr. Stone played a key role in recruiting Paul Manafort to run the Trump campaign.
Roger Stone has been indicted for covering up his engagements with Wikileaks, which U.S. intelligence officials and the Senate Intel Committee have publicly designated as a hostile intelligence service, regarding the public release of emails stolen by the Russian government.
If Mr. Kudlow, Mr. Ross, or literally anyone in this Administration would actually meet with federal workers and listen to their stories, they’d know how insulting these kinds of comments are.
16 Senators, Republicans and Democrats, just came together on the Senate floor to support a 3-week CR to reopen the government while we negotiate a bipartisan border security deal. We should get this done and get federal employees and contractors back to work.
Just sent a letter to the heads of the top 10 for-profit daycare companies asking if they plan to make accommodations for federal workers impacted by the shutdown. I’m hoping the answer will be yes.
