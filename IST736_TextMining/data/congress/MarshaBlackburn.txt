“Here’s to strong women. May we know them. May we be them. May we raise them.” #InternationalWomensDay
Earlier this week, I met with members of the Tennessee State Alliance of @ymca to get an update on their efforts around youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility. They do excellent work in our state’s local communities!
Great to visit with David Salyers yesterday, Tennessee’s new @TNEnvironment Commissioner appointed by @GovBillLee last month.
Jessie Liu’s track record as a prosecutor makes her an exceptional nominee to be the next Associate AG. I am looking forward to the @senjudiciary hearings to consider confirming this very accomplished woman to one of the top positions at @TheJusticeDept. 
Thank you to my dear friend and colleague @SecAFOfficial Dr. Heather Wilson for presenting me with the @USAirForce seal this afternoon!
Securing our European allies’ networks is just as vital as securing our own. I am glad General Scaparrotti is encouraging our partners to follow the U.S. example of blocking Huawei other Chinese government-backed technology firms from their 5G networks. @SASCMajority
This view never gets old. Preserving freedom is what it’s all about! @ United States Capitol
.@Google’s track record with women has gone from bad to worse. This is frightening, unacceptable and shameless.
Congrats to Chase and the Raptors on a great season. #marchmadness
Today marks the start of International Women’s Month! Throughout March, we honor the women who paved the way for those that followed.
Tennessee’s inclusion in this exciting new pilot project will give us a clear complete picture of broadband availability in our state. With this new data, we can continue to work to ensure underserved rural communities in Tennessee can access the broadband service they need.
The Title X Abortion Providers Prohibition Act draws the line: If you provide healthcare for women in underserved areas, then you should have access to federal funds, but abortion providers need not apply. My interview w/ @EWTNews’ @CatSzetlner here:
I spoke with @CatSzeltner about the bill I introduced to ensure that federal Title X funds don’t go to big abortion providers like Planned Parenthood. Tune into @EWTNProLife at 10pm ET/9pm CT!
Congratulations to John Ryder of Memphis on his appointment to the Board of the @TVAnews!  The Tennessee Valley is lucky to have your leadership.
As a female, you have to work twice as hard prove yourself twice as capable in order to be considered for the same position. I am grateful for Ms. Neomi Rao's diligence, preparation, and commitment to her service to our nation. My full remarks:
Just talked with @varneyco about the Democrats' disastrous #GreenNewDeal, which includes government-run healthcare - all of which could cost a whopping $93 trillion. Tennesseans aren't buying it.
Today on @senjudiciary, I am looking forward to voting to put another of @POTUS’ great nominees on the federal bunch. Neomi Rao is an originalist who will follow the rule of law and faithfully apply the Constitution.
This morning at the @SenateCommerce hearing, we discussed how to give you, as users, the tools to protect your #VirtualYou. We need more than just lip service.
Tennessee will be 1 of 8 states included in a new @NTIAgov project to expand and update the National Broadband Map. In order to close the digital divide, we must have the most accurate information possible. My full statement here:
Today at the @SenJudiciary hearing on Intellectual Property, we discussed the progress of the #MusicModernizationAct and how we can ensure music creators are fairly compensated.
Read my op-ed on why the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act shouldn't be considered controversial via @FoxNews
This is a bill I sponsored in the House and support wholeheartedly in the Senate. I hope my colleagues across the aisle will, too. There should be nothing controversial about providing necessary medical care to a newborn child.
Today, the Senate will vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Bill, which ensures that babies born as a result of a botched abortion receive the same care as any other newborn. Essentially, it’s a bill against infanticide – this vote should be a no brainer.
First signs of spring� My daffodils are covering the hillside. @ Williamson County, Tennessee
Be sure to stay alert and listen to officials in your area during the continued flooding our state is experiencing. @T_E_M_A is prepared to provide assistance. Read more from @GovBillLee here.
This rule works to accomplish the same goal as the bill I introduced last month, the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, so taxpayers can be sure their dollars only go toward funding women’s health programs, not big abortion providers.
Glad to see the President taking action to ensure that federal funding for women’s health is used for its intended purpose - not the ending of innocent human
Tennesseans and the American people deserve an honest debate focused on real ideas as to how we can further strengthen our economy and ensure its benefits are felt by more Americans. The #GreenNewDeal is a socialist tripe distracting from that debate.
Great to join State Rep @RonGant at the Tennessee State Capitol this morning!
The #GreenNewDeal is a raw deal for Tennessee. Read my piece in the @Tennessean to learn
We are thrilled to be opening our Nashville office next month, which will complete our in-state set-up.
Happy #PresidentsDay! Three of our nation’s leaders called Tennessee home: Jackson, Polk, and Johnson. Today we remember their service to our country and that of all of our past presidents.��
Fabulous account of the final push to ratify the 19th Amendment set in Nashville.
Congratulations to Major General Brian Winski, who yesterday assumed duties as Commanding General of the @101stAASLTDIV at @FtCampbell.
I know how my grandsons would answer this poll! #GBO�
Pleased to join the @NWTF_official to address their convention.

This morning at @SASCMajority, we discussed the United States’ approach to Artificial Intelligence. Staying on the cutting edge of AI is vital to the defense of our nation, and I look forward to continuing to highlight its importance.
In addition to the drastic and unrealistic lifestyle changes the #GreenNewDeal proposes, the plan also completely ignores the astronomical costs and countless years it would take to implement because these technologies don’t exist yet.
Tennesseans are excited to see @amazon coming to Nashville, and look forward to the jobs and investment it will bring to our economy.
This is what happens when state and local governments choose to pursue a socialist #WarOnBusiness agenda. The #GreenNewDeal is simply a raw deal.
Mr. Barr served with distinction as Attorney General under President Bush and will do so again under President Trump. I am proud to have voted to confirm him.
This morning, I spoke with William Barr about what we can expect from him as our nation’s Attorney General. Mr. Barr has assured me he will respect the rule of law, and will push forward qualified women to serve in @TheJusticeDept.
Happy Valentine’s Day️ Mary Morgan shared this sweet picture of us with Mimi. Jack and Chase are calling today VOLentine’s Day� So, whatever you call it, today is the day to be grateful…
The #GreenNewDeal includes government-run health care, which to Leftists is somehow a prerequisite for a clean economy. #OneBadDeal #WarOnBusiness
We need to make progress on building the wall, put additional officials and agents at the border, provide more technology to track bad actors and more beds to be able to pick them up. That is what we want to see in this deal.
The #GreenNewDeal in a few easy steps: 1) end air travel completely, 2) eliminate the jobs of every miner, oil rigger, cattle producer and gas-station attendant, 3) pay those unwilling to work. #WarOnBusiness
About to join @LizMacDonaldFOX on the @EveningEdit - hope you’ll tune in!
Need help with a federal agency? Our offices are here to help! Reach out to an office near you.
Cattle farming is the largest agriculture industry in Tennessee, and the Democrats would like to see it completely abolished through their #GreenNewDeal. This is a #WarOnBusiness.
.@arconic just announced a $100 million investment in Knoxville! Over 70 new jobs are coming to Tennessee�‍️ These are the results of strong conservative economic policies�
This legislation includes preserving President Polk’s home in Columbia, expanding the Shiloh National Military Park and naming a bridge on the Foothills Parkway after Dean Stone.
Today, the Senate passed legislation that will preserve and protect Tennessee’s natural resources and national parks for generations to come.
.@FedEx has just announced it will open a logistics facility in downtown Memphis, bringing 680 jobs to the community. More and more companies are choosing Tennessee - a true testament to the fact that our state is a great place to do business.
With the #GreenNewDeal, the Democrats are coming for our jobs, airplanes, and even our steak. It's a #WarOnBusiness.
It may be a rainy day in Washington, D.C., but we made the most of it at #TennesseeTuesday this morning!
This announcement comes as a result of the work we did @housecommerce to ensure the money we spend goes to projects that expand broadband access and close the digital divide.
We need to give border patrol officials the resources they need to secure our border. I am hopeful the proposal put forth by the conference committee will be a step in the right direction.
Until we secure our borders, every state is a border state and every town is a border town. This is what that means️
.@SenAlexander and I introduced a resolution to honor Captain Rosemary Mariner, the Navy’s first female fighter pilot. On February 2, Captain Mariner was laid to rest in Maynardville, and honored with the first all-female piloted flyover in the history of the United States Navy.
Congratulations to @MTSUNews grad Luke Laird on the big win with Kacey Musgraves! A great night for country music and for Tennessee.
The Democrats want us to completely uproot our lives, putting many industries completely out of work and requiring us to retrofit our homes to fit their disastrous regulations. The #GreenNewDeal is #OneBadDeal and a #WarOnBusiness.
Incredible premiere of “Lucy Negro, Redux”. @Nashville Ballet, Caroline Randall Williams, Paul Vasterling. Pic with @DavidSEwing, mom @wokeandwise Alice Randall. Congrats!
The people of North Carolina lost a true public servant and the U.S. military lost a champion in the passing of @RepWalterJones. 
David Williams was a pillar of the @VanderbiltU community. He was the first African American to serve as the Athletic Director in the @SEC and also as vice chancellor for the @VUCommodores. He will be remembered fondly.
Rep. @JohnDingell spent 59 years serving the people he loved. He truly answered the call to public service. My prayers are with his wife @RepDebDingell and their family at this difficult time.
Tennesseans from the National @leagueofcities stopped by to discuss federal investment in local infrastructure projects, building to withstand potential natural disasters, and expanding broadband services.
Visited with a great group of Tennesseans at this evening’s American Forest Paper Association event! Always good to hear when businesses are doing well in our state.
Great to speak to the HBCU Fly-In attendees today and have a representative from @thelanecollege in the group! Tennessee’s HBCUs generate an estimated $873 million in economic impact as well as 7,289 jobs. Thank you for the work you do for our young people.
We discussed this and more at our @SenateCommerce committee hearing this morning. It is important to ensure that we meet the needs for expanding broadband in our communities while also protecting our networks from foreign adversaries.
As we look to expand broadband, we need to ensure the technology we are using is secure. We should be mindful that winning the race to 5G requires a whole of government approach and collaboration with the private sector.
“Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed in for them to do the same.” Happy Birthday to President Reagan!
This morning, Knoxville Fire Chief D.J. Corcoran, whoaccompanied me to the #SOTU and his wife, Wendy, joined me on @FoxandFriends to discuss the tragic loss of their son, Pierce, who was killed by an illegal immigrant. @Justice4Pierce #AngelFamilies
My statement on tonight’s #SOTU:
We’re seeing real results, and I am excited to work with both the @POTUS and with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue to bring about real change for the American people.
In the one year since the #TaxCutsandJobsAct was passed, 51,900 jobs have come to Tennessee.
Our economy is growing at unprecedented rates, with 304,000 jobs added to the economy in January.
Tonight’s #SOTU will highlight the many ways our country has benefitted from the Republican policies implemented over the past two years.
Another #TennesseeTuesday with @senalexander in the books! Great to meet with so many constituents on this beautiful day in Washington.
It is an honor to attend with them. Please join me in praying for their family and other #AngelFamilies across our country. #JusticeForPierce
Tonight, Knoxville Fire Chief D.J. Corcoran and his wife, Wendy, will join Rep. @TimBurchett and me as our guests to #SOTU. Their family has experienced an unthinkable tragedy following the loss of their 22 year old son, Pierce, who was killed by an illegal immigrant in December.
The Navy’s first female fighter pilot was laid to rest yesterday, and her life was celebrated with the first all-female flyover in her honor. Thank you, Captain Rosemary Mariner, for your service to our country.�� via @knoxnews
Best way to spend a Tennessee evening: at the Grand Ole @opry with @TheLeeGreenwood!
Keeping my friend @JeremyFaison4TN and his family in my thoughts today and praying for a speedy recovery.
In 2017, 1,776 Tennesseans died from drug overdose, 500 of which were from Fentanyl. Stopping the flow of this drug into our country is crucial to addressing this public health crisis.
Tennessee law enforcement officials tell us Fentanyl is a threat to safety on our streets and lives in our communities. It is fueling the opioid crisis.
304,000 jobs were added to the U.S. economy in January - nearly twice the number forecasted. Our pro-growth policies are providing real results for the American people.
Senator Sasse just asked the Senate to unanimously pass S. 130, a bill to stop infanticide. It is unconscionable for the Democrats to obstruct legislation that protects life.
The good people of Virginia should demand the resignation of an elected official who would recommend the premeditated taking of the life of a child.
It is an honor to join with @timburchett to bring DJ and Wendy Corcoran as our guests to the State of the Union. #JusticeForPierce
RT @Tennessean: Sen. Marsha Blackburn partners with Democrat to urge Trump to protect Kurdish troops in Syria
This morning, I joined @SenDuckworth in writing a letter to the president to express the importance of protecting our Kurdish friends as the administration plans its withdrawal of American troops from Syria.
Governor Northam’s callous and nonchalant attitude toward protecting the unborn reveals a hardened inner core that is horrifying.
This legislation would bring real reform to our appropriations process and allow Congress to conduct better oversight of how effectively funds are being used.
Tennessee taxpayers expect the federal government to manage their tax dollars wisely. That’s why I’m cosponsoring the Biennial Budgeting and Appropriations Act to convert the annual appropriations process for federal tax dollars to a two-year budget cycle.
Since the #TaxCutsandJobsAct passed in 2017, our state has seen enormous job growth!

If you're not for the three things that our border patrol agents are asking for - a physical barrier, more technology, and additional agents - you are not for border security. It is time for Democrats to negotiate.
It is time for Speaker Pelosi to come to the table and negotiate to #SecureOurBorder.

Joined Montgomery County leaders for breakfast yesterday, including @mcgtn Mayor Jim Durrett, @Clarksville_TN Mayor Joe Pitts, and members of the @FortCampbell command team.
Started out a busy Tuesday in Clarksville discussing the needs of our Tennessee military and veteran community.
It’s important to give families the freedom to choose the best education for their children. That is why during this year’s #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek, I am cosponsoring the CHOICE Act with @SenatorTimScott.
We honor the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who challenged each of us and our nation. Let us remember his legacy by striving to leave our country better off for the next generation.
.@realDonaldTrump is correct. The problems of open borders create problems that spread across the country, making every town a border town and every state a border state.
An honor to be here to witness @BillLeeTN being sworn into office by Jeff Bivins, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Tennessee. I look forward to working with our new Governor to make our state an even better place to live for all Tennesseans!
Happy birthday @DollyParton! Lots of love and birthday wishes coming your way all day long from Tennessee.
Today, as the pro-life community joins together in Washington, D.C. to #MarchForLife, President Trump has demonstrated his commitment to protecting life by promising to veto legislation that may weaken federal pro-life policy. Thank you, Mr. President!
Devastated by the news that Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Jonathan R. Farmer, who served with a special forces unit from Fort Campbell, was killed in Syria on Wednesday. My heart goes out to his wife and four children and I will keep them in my prayers.
I’ll be on @EveningEdit with @LizMacDonaldFOX at 6pm ET/5pm CT. Hope you’ll tune in!
The bill I introduced last week ensures that Title X funds go to one of the thousands of organizations nationwide that provide much needed women’s health care - not to big abortion providers like Planned Parenthood.
Tomorrow, thousands of Tennesseans will come to Washington, D.C. to #MarchForLife. Every American has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and that is #WhyWeMarch.
Tune into @FoxNewsNight with @ShannonBream at 11pm ET/10pm CT to hear about my bill to prevent abortion providers from receiving federal funding, this year’s March for Life, and this week’s @senjudiciary hearing for AG nominee Barr.
This afternoon, I met with the Corcorans, whose son and brother Pierce was tragically killed two weeks ago by an illegal alien. My prayers are with #AngelFamilies across this country. No family should ever have to experience such a tragedy. #JusticeForPierce
The third names a Foothills Parkway bridge in honor of Dean Stone, a true pillar of his community, and serves as a way to thank him for his dedication to improving the lives of all who enjoy the Smokies.
The next will expand Shiloh National Military Park and give these sites the resources needed for their upkeep to maintain our state’s military history.
The first will preserve President James K. Polk’s home in Columbia, Tennessee, so that all Tennesseans can study his presidency while enjoying the place that meant so much to him.
Today, @SenAlexander and I introduced a package of land bills to ensure that our public spaces have the resources they need so Tennesseans can enjoy them for generations to come.
Thank you, Mr. President, for your work to make our country such a great place to do business! We are very excited that so many companies are choosing Tennessee.
Working together, we can pass legislation to protect life. Ahead of this year’s #MarchForLife, 22 Senators are co-sponsoring my bill to strip abortion providers of federal funding under Title X of the Public Health Service Act. #WhyWeMarch
Honored to be the fourth Tennessean to sit at Desk LXXVI (76) on the Senate Floor.
It’s been one year since the historic #GOPTaxCuts were enacted and American workers are seeing real results.
Both Volkswagen and General Motors’ decisions to expand their businesses in Tennessee are further proof that our workers and business friendly climate create a great place for jobs growth.
Our border patrol agents tell us they need three things to secure the sovereignty of this nation: a wall, technology, and more agents on the ground. We need to give them the tools they need to keep our country safe.
Since Republicans passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, 2.6 million new jobs have been created with a massive increase of 312,000 jobs in December!
Your peace, your security needs a secure border. Every state is a border state and every town a border town until we secure the border and stop traffickers and illegal entry.

My statement on President Trump’s Oval Office Address:
I just cast my first vote in the United States Senate, and I look forward to watching the President’s Oval Office address at 9pm ET. We need to take action to secure our southern border.
Last week, I was honored to be sworn into the Senate by the @VP and then by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Excited to get to work for the people of Tennessee!
This morning, I joined @foxandfriends to discuss the importance of building the wall. It is imperative that we secure our border and keep the American people safe.
$5 billion is one-tenth of what we spend on foreign aid. That is a small price to pay to protect the American people and secure our border.
Today’s jobs report exceeded expectations, proving that the #GOPTaxCuts are working for the American people. -312,000 jobs added in December -Wages up 3.2% from last year -Unemployment at 3.9%

Thanks to @TNFarmBureau, @SecretarySonny, @EPAAWheeler all those who participated in today's event. The new common sense #WOTUS definitions will bring much-needed clarity for the benefit of farmers, ranchers, and rural communities in Tennessee across the nation.
My statement on @SenAlexander's decision to not seek re-election.
Grateful to have helped usher this bill through. While long overdue, we’re hopeful this solution will bring strong reforms to protect victims, improve accountability transparency, and fix a broken system for workplace harassment and discrimination.
A pleasure hosting Governor-elect @BillLeeTN in Washington this afternoon. I look forward to working together to serve the great people of Tennessee!

Always great to visit our service men women of the @101stAASLTDIV @FortCampbell. Special thanks to @SenTomCotton for joining me. These soldiers, leaders civilians serve as one of the most agile units in the @USArmy. Thank you for all you do to protect Tennesseans Americans!
My heart breaks for the families who lost loved ones during the horrific events at the Tree of Life Synagogue. Thank you to law enforcement who acted quickly to apprehend the shooter. These anti-Semitic acts of evil have no place in society I am praying for all those affected.
This is a day of hope for the countless families in Tennessee and across America who have been devastated by the #opioidcrisis. Thank you, @realDonaldTrump, for signing into law this bipartisan package of solutions that will help stem the tide of addiction and save lives.
Always a pleasure to meet w/ @RecordingAcad members. It's my honor to represent the #Nashville area- a place where men women come to chase their dreams. These artists deserve to be fairly compensated for their work I am thrilled we got #MusicModernizationAct signed into law!
