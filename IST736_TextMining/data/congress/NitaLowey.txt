I believe we can debate important policy without using offensive, painful stereotypes.
No member of Congress is asked to swear allegiance to another country. Throughout history, Jews have been accused of dual loyalty, leading to discrimination and violence, which is why these accusations are so hurtful.
Lawmakers must be able to debate w/o prejudice or bigotry. I am saddened that Rep. Omar continues to mischaracterize support for Israel. I urge her to retract this statement and engage in further dialogue with the Jewish community on why these comments are so hurtful.
Gross islamophobic stereotypes - like those about @IlhanMN recently featured on posters in WVA - are offensive and have no place in political discourse. Anti-Semitic tropes that accuse Jews of dual loyalty are equally painful and must also be roundly condemned.
Finding meaningful employment is one of the best ways for veterans to transition back into civilian life. The Department of Veterans Affairs is hosting a Veteran Job Fair on Friday, March 1 @VAHudsonValley to connect veterans with local agencies and potential employers.
