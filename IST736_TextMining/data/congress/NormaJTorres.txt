The bipartisan deal to #KeepGovernmentOpen reclaims our American values. It funds smart border security, invests in our communities, and ensures we treat immigrants with dignity. We can finally move on, give federal workers certainty, and get down to the business of governing.

Nationally, the top 1 percent of families made 25 times as much as the bottom 99 percent of workers. Raising wages for working people helps to create an economy that works for everyone, instead of just a wealthy few.
Of the 41 million low-wage workers who would benefit: more than half are women and nearly one-third work in the manufacturing, construction, education, and health care fields.
If we #RaiseTheWage to $12 by 2020, 35 million workers would get a raise. We'd also lift nearly 4.5 million people out of poverty. Even better, raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would give more than 41 million Americans a pay raise.
Do you remember the last time the federal minimum wage was raised? TEN years ago.
According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition's annual report , a worker would need to earn at least $17.90 an hour in a 40 hour workweek to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment. That's more than $10 over the federal minimum wage of $7.25.
I’d like to know where in the U.S. $7.25/hr is enough to pay for a month’s worth of rent, utilities, and groceries. If you know of such a place, take a picture and comment below.
The average 1-bedroom apartment in the U.S. costs $892/month. How much do you think you would have to earn per hour in a 40-hour workweek to afford rent?

Last year, @realDonaldTrump said car companies were expanding their manufacturing plants in the US. FACT: Just today, GM began to layoff 4K salaried workers:
President Trump promised that lowering the business tax rate would create jobs. FACT: the $1.5 Trillion tax cut had no effect on investment or hiring:
That’s why last week, @HouseDemocrats voted to give our federal civilian workers a raise that recognizes the dignity of their work. #SOTU2019
Don't be fooled by tonight’s speech.  @realDonaldTrump doesn't care about our federal workers. Not only did he make our workers undergo a 35-day shutdown, miss two paychecks, and cause panic to American families, he voted to freeze a much needed pay raise for this year. (Thread)
.@realDonaldTrump would have a lot more credibility on Venezuela if he hadn’t already abandoned American principles of human rights and democracy everywhere else.
Why I’m skeptical: During last year's #SOTU, @realDonaldTrump claimed that reducing the price of prescription drugs was one of his administration's top priorities. FACT: Drug makers have announced plans to raise drug prices in defiance of President Trump.
.@realdonaldtrump’s trade war isn’t helping California - instead he’s driving business to Europe, Canada, and Japan.
FACT: Trump policies have actually hurt women's rights by reinstating the global gag rule, halting equal pay efforts, and rescinding Title IX protections on college campuses. #SOTU2019
We can’t let @realDonaldTrump trick us with false choices. We can secure our borders without wasting taxpayer dollars on a useless wall or tearing children away from their parents. #SOTU2019

Mr. President, there isn’t a single state in the union where someone working 40-hours a week and earning the federal minimum wage can afford to live in a 1-bedroom home and their most basic needs. #RaiseTheWage
