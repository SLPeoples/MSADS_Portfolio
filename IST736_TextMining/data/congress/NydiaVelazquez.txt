Today, members of Congress and I took a major step toward fixing our broken system of elections by passing #HR1 #ForThePeople Act. We are on our way to create a more responsive and representative government.
#ForThePeople Act passed the house 234-193 making it easier for voters to cast a ballot, transforming how campaigns are funded to amplify the voices of ordinary Americans, and bolstering election security and government ethics. A great day for our democracy!

Everyone on Capitol Hill will remember John Dingell. I personally will always be inspired by his profound belief in our democracy love for the House as an institution. His passion for assuring healthcare to all Americans, regardless of their income reminds us why we fight. RIP
