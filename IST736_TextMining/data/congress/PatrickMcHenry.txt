My thoughts are with Senator McCain and his family. He was a true patriot who served our nation for decades. Giulia and I have his family, friends, and staff in our prayers as they mourn his passing.
RT @SteveScalise: We’re all praying for you and your family, @SenJohnMcCain.
Dr. Ed Sadler was a great leader of Gaston County Schools. He was a transformational educator, principal and superintendent.  He will be missed.
