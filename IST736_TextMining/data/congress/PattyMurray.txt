The idea that President Trump not being able to pass his wall spending through Congress constitutes an ‘emergency’ is absurd. The idea of the president cutting our country's military pay and pensions to pay for his wall is wrong. #FakeTrumpEmergency

Because of the measles outbreak in WA's Clark County, more than 800 students are having to stay away from classrooms for up to 3 weeks. We must continue to educate parents to understand the science—vaccines are safe and effective. #VaccinesSavesLives
Measles isn’t just deadly—it’s one of the world’s most contagious diseases. This is why the measles vaccine is so important in providing protection. We know that #VaccinesWork and we must continue to educate people families build vaccine

This week Republicans confirmed Trump court pick Allison Rushing, who has alarming views about women and the LGBTQ community. Another reason we must continue to fight their efforts to jam through judicial nominees who want to take our country backwards.

With the help of federal programs like Pell Grants, I was able to attend college and become a U.S. Senator. As I work on the #HigherEd Act, I will fight to provide today’s students with the same opportunities afforded to me and so many others in our country.
Protecting the Methow Headwaters from harmful mining efforts is one step closer to becoming reality thanks to the bipartisan #LandsPackage2019—now that it has passed Congress, it's time for the president to sign it into law.
Expecting mothers need health care, not shackles. I introduced the Stop Shackling and Detaining Pregnant Women Act​ to end the Trump Admin’s backwards policy on detaining pregnant women and improve transparency and standards of care for youth and pregnant women in ICE custody.
We must rewrite the #HigherEd Act so that it strengthens federal investments in our students, incentivizes states to reinvest in higher education, ensures students have access to an education that helps them succeed in today's economy
Last week, the House voted against President Trump's un-American declaration of #FakeTrumpEmergency. We're on the track to do the same in the Senate and it sends a very clear message to the president.
“This is truly a historic moment."The #LandsPackage2019 will help protect natural resources like WA's Methow Headwaters the Yakima River Basin for future generations. President Trump should sign it into law now.

Outspoken and unconventional, trailblazer May Arkwright Hutton moved to Spokane in 1906 before becoming a key leader in WA's women’s suffrage movement. The fight for her mission—to enfranchise voters regardless of “age, race, or color"—continues on today. #WomensHistoryMonth
It is unacceptable that pregnant women in ICE custody are being detained in dangerous and unhealthy conditions. The Trump Admin must end their reckless and immoral policy and put women's health first.
Thanks to the students teachers from Liberty Bell High in Winthrop, WA for visiting us today! Liberty Bell High's "Family Empowerment Fund" that helps low-income families w/ food, clothing, other necessities is truly an inspiration for me for people communities in WA.
Despite overwhelming public support for net neutrality in WA and across the country, President’s Trump @FCC voted to repeal the rules that kept the internet free and open.This is shameful and another reason why we need to keep fighting to #SaveTheNet. #NetNeutrality

People across the country will be watching this vote closely because they know that despite Republicans’ promises to fight for their health care when it matters—when the care they need is truly on the line—Republicans haven’t come through for them once. I hope that changes today.
The choice here is simple and straightforward. Republicans can’t be for protections for people with pre-existing conditions and for making Readler, who wants to strike them down, a Circuit Judge.
Chad Readler has been Trump's right hand man when it comes to undermining health care for people across the country.
Let’s be clear: Chad Readler’s nomination is the latest test of whether Republicans are serious about fighting for people’s health care—and every Republican who supports him is failing yet again.
People across the country haven’t forgotten how they had to speak up and stop Republicans from jamming through their awful Trumpcare bill and they also won’t forget if Republicans decide to ignore them again and rally around a judicial nominee who wants to do the same damage.
On the Senate floor to vote NO on the nomination of Chad Readler, who has proven time and time again he is focused on undermining health care for families who need it the most.
"If I can’t get justice, then I can change the law so that somebody else will.” - @leahegriffinWith Leah's help, I introduced #SASCA to make sure sexual assault survivors can get care that meets their needs and helps hold perpetrators accountable.
The idea that any Republican who votes to confirm Chad Readler is serious about protections for pre-existing conditions, or helping families get affordable health care is plain wrong. I hope Republicans change course and join Democrats in opposing Readler’s nomination.
Republicans have claimed time and time again they're going to fight for families’ health care and for protections that help those most in need.This week, they have a chance to prove it by voting against Chad Readler—President Trump’s right-hand man for health care sabotage.
Reminder: @BetsyDeVosED's anti-public school agenda lacks support from parents, students, teachers, from within her own party. Congress has repeatedly rejected her privatization efforts and it should be clear that her latest proposal is dead on

Last week Republican leaders confirmed Eric Miller over the objections of his home state senators, me @SenatorCantwell. This is an alarming precedent that has steered the Senate down a very dangerous path.
The Vaccines for Children Program is a great example of investing in prevention. For 25 years now it has helped kids in low income families get shots at no cost. It has saved $1.6T, prevented 380M illnesses, saved 860,000 lives—that’s more people than the population of Seattle.
Declining vaccination coverage rates are leading to preventable outbreaks. In Clark Co., WA, public health officials continue to respond to a measles outbreak. The immunization rate among children in that community is less than 70%—far below what is needed to keep families safe.
Each case of measles isn’t just a concern for family members worried about loved ones—it’s a threat to neighbors and communities left to contain a contagious disease, a terror for parents with newborns who can’t get vaccinated, and a strain on our public health system.
The measles outbreaks in Washington state and across the country are a clear sign we have to do more to address vaccine hesitancy and make sure parents have the facts they need to understand the science: vaccines are safe, effective, and life-saving.
Vaccines that protect against measles have been in use for over 50 years. We know they are safe, effective, and lifesaving.

Despite the Trump Administration’s inaction, I’m glad Congress has taken bipartisan steps to address the opioid epidemic, including two major pieces of legislation and an increase of $2.6 billion in new resources to combat opioid misuse disorder. There is much more to do.
Earlier this month the administration released its first ever National Drug Control Strategy. It contains nothing new. It identifies no funding needs. It's 20 pages long, and easily summarized in two words—not enough.
The costs of the opioid crisis are also seen in health providers treating babies born addicted to opioids, kids placed in foster care, parents who have lost children to an overdose, and veterans in chronic pain who are struggling with addiction.
The opioid crisis costs our country an estimated $500 billion a year—and that doesn’t begin to capture the emotional devastation on families and communities.

The Child Care for Working Families Act would guarantee access to high-quality, affordable child care for families living paycheck to paycheck and working families in Washington state and across the country. #ChildCare4All

Yesterday, I reintroduced the Child Care for Working Families Act with my Senate colleagues @SenBobCasey and @maziehirono along with parents and advocates as we laid out our vision for affordable, high-quality #ChildCare4All.We hear you and we're fighting for you.
RT @civilrightsorg: Thank you, Sen. @PattyMurray, for speaking out so powerfully against the confirmation of Neomi Rao to the DC Circuit.…
While in college, Neomi Rao wrote that “a good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober.”It's never a survivor’s fault—ever—that someone raped or sexually assaulted them. Ms. Rao was given an opportunity to reject those comments and failed to do so.
In her Trump Admin role, Neomi Rao has: - placed harmful requirements on Title X-funded health centers designed to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving these funds- put forward rules that would make it harder for members of the LGBTQ community women to get care they need

As a preschool teacher and a "mom in tennis shoes," I mobilized thousands of parents in WA to save my children's preschool program.As a U.S. Senator, I reintroduced the Child Care for Working Families Act to guarantee #ChildCare4All families in WA and across the country.

Under the Trump-Pence admin's #TitleX rule, millions of women who rely on Title X-funded providers for care—from birth control, to cancer screenings and more—will lose access to the health care they need. Women and men are speaking up and making clear that is absolutely wrong.
Next time Republicans want a conversation about protecting babies children, I’m happy to talk about:- babies children separated from their parents at the border- pre-existing conditions coverage that GOP put at riskThese are problems that do exist need to be solved.
Maybe Republican leaders are hoping that most Americans aren’t paying attention to what’s happening in the Senate—that somehow tossing out Senate norms in order to move our country’s courts far right will go unnoticed. I'm here to make sure everyone knows! #StopMiller
Not only did Republicans schedule Miller's confirmation hearing during a recess period when just 2 GOP Senators were able to attend, the hearing had less than 5 minutes of questioning—less questioning for a lifetime appointment than most students face for a book report in school.
I urge my colleagues to truly think about what confirming Eric Miller's nomination means and ask themselves: - Are we still able to work together in a bipartisan way for the country and the people we serve? - Will our work in the Senate be reduced to political gamesmanship?
Last year #TitleX helped provide birth control, cancer screenings, and needed care for over 4 million women. Last week Pres. Trump and VP Pence announced their plan to undermine it and make it harder for women to get the care they need.
Today the House took an important step in passing the #PaycheckFairness Act through Committee.It's past time that the gender wage gap ends once and for all, and I'm going to keep pushing my colleagues in the Senate to get this done to ensure #EqualPayForEqualWork.
The Republicans' bill could have forced women facing incredibly personal decisions to undergo inappropriate, medically unnecessary care despite their wishes all because Republican politicians think their beliefs matter more. That's absolutely wrong. #ProtectProviders
Extreme Republicans think they know better than women—they don't—about women’s health care and they want to further undermine a woman’s constitutionally protected right to safe, legal abortion with the Trump admin's #TitleX gag

As one tribal leader from my home state of WA put it, Eric Miller has built a career out of mounting challenges against tribes—including their sovereignty, lands, religious freedom, core attributes of federal recognition. This is a serious matter worthy of true examination.
For this Senate to confirm Eric Miller—without the consent or true input of both home state senators, and after a sham hearing—would be a dangerous first for this Senate. This is NOT a partisan issue—this is a question of the Senate’s ability to properly review nominees.
Let’s recap the facts:- Neither I, nor my colleague @SenatorCantwell, returned our blue slips on Eric Miller's nomination to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court- I have deep concerns about Mr. Miller’s work fighting against tribes- His hearing was a sham, simply to check the box
Republican leaders are barreling toward a confirmation vote on Eric Miller, a flashpoint that—if it succeeds —will mark a departure from the long-standing bipartisan process that has helped this Senate put consensus nominees on the bench for as long as we have all been here.
Heading to the Senate floor to once again sound the alarm on the dangerous path that the Senate is being steered down with a pending vote on Eric Miller to the Ninth Circuit Court.WATCH ️
In 2015, in WA state alone, #TitleX-funded care providers helped over 80k women get the health care they needed—cancer screenings, birth control more. Now Pres. Trump wants to undermine this program care for millions of women across the country.
The Trump-Pence admin's efforts to undermine #TitleX will make whether women can get the health care they need more dependent on where they live how much they make. That's unacceptable—women men across the country are not going to stand for it. 
These are more lies from a party determined to keep women from making their own health care decisions. That’s wrong and Democrats are going to keep fighting back.

Republicans' anti-doctor bill would have overruled health care providers and subjected them to criminal penalties for choosing to let medical standards—not politics—drive patients' care. #ProtectProviders

It's wrong that survivors of the horrific abuse Jeffrey Epstein committed were denied info about the plea deal ‘of a lifetime’ that now-@SecretaryAcosta helped negotiate. This shows yet again that Acosta never should've been confirmed in the first
I'm inspired by the many working parents and advocates across the country who are making their voices heard on this issue—we hear you and we are fighting for you.I'm ready to keep fighting to make #ChildCare4All a reality and I'm proud to have all of you by my side.
The Child Care for Working Families Act would jumpstart our economy by:- creating more than 770,000 child care jobs, - allowing 1.6 million parents go back to work- giving parents the peace of mind that their kids are safe and are being set up for success#ChildCare4All
The Child Care for Working Families Act would:- ensure no parent has to pay more than they can afford on child care- expand access to quality preschool - invest in child care educators with the training to help our children through their most important stage #ChildCare4All
Parents across America know we can do better that's why I’m proud to reintroduce the Child Care for Working Families Act. This bill would guarantee access to high-quality, affordable child care for families living paycheck to paycheck our working middle class. #ChildCare4All
I thank the parents advocates who've been fighting for #ChildCare4All. Because you:- shared your stories- brought your children to Capitol Hill to meet w/ lawmakers - never gave upWe brought our nation’s child care crisis to the forefront of the national conversation.
I'm grateful to be joined by @SenBobCasey and Senator @maziehirono as we reintroduce the Child Care for Working Families Act today and lay out our vision for affordable, high-quality #ChildCare4All.
