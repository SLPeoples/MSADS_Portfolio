Vermont is once again leading the nation—this time on senior health care. The Support and Services at Home (SASH) program cuts costs and grants our aging citizens the dignity and care they deserve with a focus on both health and social needs.
If confirmed, Judge Kavanaugh will cement a right-wing Supreme Court that will rubber stamp President Trump’s destructive agenda. At stake is whether the president is above the law and whether Roe v. Wade endures.
It is more important now than ever that the Supreme Court fulfill its constitutional role as an independent check on the powers and policies of the executive branch.
Best of luck to all Vermont students, teachers and faculty members heading back to school this week. Have a great school year!
