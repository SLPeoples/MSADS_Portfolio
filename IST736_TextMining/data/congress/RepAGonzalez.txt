So proud to be surrounded by strong women like these ladies. Thanks, Mom, for raising me to be the man I am today. Happy #internationalwomensday!

NEO’s vets have a rich history of service to our nation, and there is never enough we can do to say thank you to these men and women for their devotion to our nation. The #TVT initiative and our Veterans History Project is just one way I hope to be able to give back to our vets.
This video honors @USArmy Vietnam War Veteran Russ Tobel of Berea who shared his story with me for the @librarycongress #VeteransHistoryProject. Thank you, Russ, for your service and for sharing your story with me!
Today and the first Thursday of every month I'll be putting out videos with #TVT, (Thank-a-Vet Thursday) to celebrate #OH16 veterans. Watch the first one on my YouTube channel here:
It is a sad day in NEO to see this plant close. I was sent to Congress this year to help turn the tide and bring manufacturing jobs back to our area, and I’m going to be fighting in Congress to do just that.
I sent this letter to @SecElaineChao this week requesting long needed funding to extend the Stark Co. segment of US 30. Ensuring NEO has the infrastructure to support our local industries will give #OH16 the framework we need to thrive. More info here:
Today's #Mailbag is from Mike of Canal Fulton who asked about the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act. I'm proud to cosponsor this bill to ensure our veterans can get the care and treatment they deserve. Mike - Thank you for your service your letter:
Great to meet #OH16 #WWII veteran Emory Crowder last week when he visited Washington, DC! We toured the U.S. Navy Museum together and saw some cool artifacts from the ship he served on. Thank you, Emory, for your service!
Pleased to see many of my Dem colleagues calling this out for what it is. There is no place for anti-Semitism in our society and certainly not in the halls of Congress. Similarly, the Islamophobic attack on Rep. Omar by @WVGOP is equally despicable and reprehensible.
Technology and innovation are major keys to economic success here in Northeast Ohio. This new initiative by Agile Networks is just one of many ways our local businesses are working to grow Northeast Ohio and put our communities on the cutting edge.
While you were sleeping, @SpaceX launched a shuttle relying on technology pioneered by @NASAglenn towards the International Space Station. This flight paves the way for a new generation of American human spaceflight. ��
Proud to have introduced my first bill this week! Check out my weekly update here for more info on this and everything else that happened in Congress this week:
Great article here from the @TheDailyRecord. We need to make our region a destination for young families and technological innovation to help bridge the skills gap and keep our local economy on a path towards success. 
How firm thy friendship - Happy 216th Birthday Ohio!
This week Northeast Ohio lost a hero in Chuck Craig. Chuck was a tremendous advocate for our local veterans - he will be dearly missed. Thank you, Chuck, for your lifelong service!

Just introduced my first bill - H.R. 1424, the Fallen Warrior Battlefield Cross Memorial Act! These soldiers gave everything for our nation and there will never be enough we can do or say to thank them in return. More here:
Proud to announce my office is currently seeking a wounded or disabled veteran for a two-year paid fellowship in my North Canton Office through the Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program. Check out the link here for details on how to apply!
We need to bring real competition to our credit industry to hold bureaus accountable and help extend credit to more people. Innovative technologies like machine learning can help us get there. Check out my from yesterday's @financecmte hearing here:
Northeast Ohio had a major victory tonight with the passage of important legislation to help fund the Ohio Erie Canalway and protect this historic national heritage area. Proud to have supported this legislation to protect one of Northeast Ohio's treasures.
600+ startups have been formed through the various #ICORPS sites including at @uakron @UToledo , and my alma mater @OhioState. This bill safeguards our economy by empowering future entrepreneurs across our country to turn their wildest dreams into our collective achievements.
Yesterday I spoke on the House floor to support the Innovators and Entrepreneurs Act that will create jobs by expanding the #ICORPS program that helps innovators learn how to turn their research into new products and businesses. Proud to see this bipartisan bill pass the House.

My time to question today's witnesses in our @FinancialCmte hearing is coming up! Tune in here to watch:
Today's mailbag comes from Steven in Middleburg Heights who asked me to support border security measures and fix our immigration system. Thank you Steven for your letter! This is an issue I've been talking a lot about. I hope you find this answer helpful:
This week we had our first district work week since I was sworn in as your congressman. Felt great to be back home for a whole week and hear from you all in person on issues that matter most. Watch my #WeeklyRundown here for an update on the week:
Comsat Architects in my hometown of Rocky River is part of the tech innovation that is putting Northeast Ohio on the map. Looking forward to working with @housesciencegop in Congress to support our local scientific community and keep Northeast Ohio research on the cutting edge.
This morning I stopped by @NASAGlenn to visit their facility and see some of the great research and testing they’re doing here. Looking forward to working to keep our nation on the cutting edge of technology and exploration as a new member of @housesciencegop.
Great roundtable discussion this morning with @GrtAkronChamber and local NEO leaders to talk about how I can be of help in my new seat on @FinancialCmte. Looking forward to putting everyone’s ideas to work!
Spent time yesterday with some awesome students @WadsworthHS who asked insightful questions about what it's like to be a Congressman and how they can get involved here at home. Great to see so many students engaging on important issues here at home!
Started off my day in Medina at @TireSource which employs 62 people across 6 different Northeast Ohio locations. Great to see local businesses like these thriving here at home while I work to bring back pro-growth policies from Washington.
Today we celebrate our nation's presidents, past and present. Happy #PresidentsDay!
My statement on this evening's funding vote below:
I jumped on the phone last week with @1590WAKR's @JasenSokol to share my reaction on President Trump's #SOTU, funding the government, and big issues Congress should come together on. ICYMI, listen to the interview here:

ICYMI, last week I caught up with @BillWills to talk about #SOTU and my first month in Congress. Listen to our conversation here:
This bill does not question where one stands on the pro-life debate. This bill simply states that all children born in this country deserve the same protections under the law. It is that simple, and it should pass unanimously.
As a new father, it is hard to imagine a world in which the killing of a newborn child is acceptable, let alone legal in our country. The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should not be a partisan bill. It is common sense.
This week's #mondaymailbag comes from James, a 15- year-old from Medina who wants to know how to become a Congressman when he grows up. There's no one path to become a congressman, but I hope this advice helps. Thanks for writing in!
Love this! Looking forward to working with the women of @NASAglenn to promote STEM careers and education in Northeast Ohio as a member of @housesciencegop.
Veterans facing mental health challenges deserve the best possible care, and that includes eliminating barriers to access like childcare. I'm proud to have voted to require the VA to provide childcare to eligible vets while they receive mental health treatment at VA facilities.
Today's #weeklyrundown includes my take on this week's #SOTU address plus today's vote to provide childcare for veterans seeking treatment at the VA. For more updates like this subscribe to my newsletter at
Frank Robinson was a baseball icon in Cleveland and across the nation. I'm saddened to hear of his passing and my thoughts are with the Robinson family. He will be missed by many.
The Great Lakes are a critical part of Northeast Ohio. Today I joined colleagues in introducing a bill to promote cutting edge research and ensure we have the knowledge and tools to keep our lakes and fisheries healthy for generations to come. More here:

I'm encouraged to hear President Trump's call for unity and compromise here in Washington and across our nation. We need to work together to solve our nation's biggest issues. My full response to this evening's #SOTU below.
RT @JimTressel5: Proud to be the guest of @RepAGonzalez at the State of the Union ��
Excited to be joined at my first #SOTU by my wife, Elizabeth, and my former football coach and longtime mentor @JimTressel5. Jim has always encouraged me to go where I thought I could be the most useful. For me, that was Congress. Proud to share this moment with him today.
We need to ensure we are doing our jobs, and that means putting an end to government shutdowns or, at the very least, ensuring lawmakers are not paid in the event of one. It is time to make Washington work for the people again.
For me, this is simple: our government has a responsibility to the men and women of this country to come together and solve our big challenges. I have been working in a bipartisan manner here in Congress to do just that.
Starting my Congressional career in the midst of a partial government shutdown has made fixing our government even more of a top priority for me. I'm working in a bipartisan manner in Congress to end future shutdowns. Learn more about my work here:
Today's mailbag is from Ken in Hinckley, who asked about protections for people with preexisting conditions. Obamacare has been awful for most Ohioans, but this was one positive aspect of it. Check out my video here for more:
Had a great visit to @ua_legion808 today to talk about how the organization assists student veterans through peer support and connection to services. Our vets put it all on the line for our country, and it is our duty to do all we can to support them when they return.
Visited @ups_east today in Akron and saw how a package moved from start to finish in the facility. Great to see how technology is utilized to enhance the consumer experience and increase efficiency in American businesses.
This week's #WeeklyRundown comes to you from my new district office in Strongsville! Watch here for updates on my work in Congress to prevent future shutdowns and bring jobs and economic growth to Northeast Ohio.
Thank you @mcjvs for all that you do to prepare our children with tangible skills to apply throughout their careers. Great visit!
Thank you hard working men and women of Border Patrol for keeping this fentanyl out of Ohio! There was enough in this shipment to kill 57 million people (5x the total population of Ohio).
The @POTUS Buy America Exec. Order signed this morning will give our NE Ohio manufacturing industry an opportunity to grow and bring new life to our local economy. I look forward to bringing forth more changes like this to bring jobs empower our economy.
I'm proud to have recently cosponsored the House version of this bill. Congress needs to learn to work together to solve our nation's biggest problems, including securing our border and reforming our immigration system.
More resources here for those fighting the cold tonight in Northeast Ohio. Stay safe everyone!
Additional resources are available in @CuyahogaCounty. Check below plus additional details from @cleveland19news here:
Temperatures are dropping in NE Ohio! Stay safe outside and check out these available resources if you need help keeping warm. In Stark County, the following resources are available:
We need to learn to work together to solve our nation’s biggest problems, including securing our border and reforming our immigration system. This bill keeps shutdowns like this from happen and puts the impetus on our federal government to actually come together on real solutions
Just cosponsored the End Government Shutdowns Act. There is a lot that Congress disagrees on, but we should all be able to come together on the fact that the Washington dysfunction that lead to this shutdown is absolutely inexcusable.
Always great to see my good friend @brianhartline. Thanks for the reminder @ohiostatefb of what an incredible honor it was to don the scarlet and gray. #GoBucks #DevelopedHere
Thank you Leah for your heartfelt letter about the real problems facing families during government shutdowns. Government shutdowns should never occur, and I look forward to supporting legislation to make sure they never occur again.
Congratulations to Sandra Hull on a great 32 years at Main Street Wooster! Downtown Wooster was transformed under your leadership, and the mark you've made will live on long past your tenure.
I am encouraged to see our nation’s leaders finally ready to come to the table, but our government should never have entered this shutdown in the first place. My full statement below:
Congress has a choice: We either come together and negotiate a solution to this #shutdown ourselves, or we continue to sit by as more problems emerge. Day 34, and we still have not had a single substantive discussion. This is beyond unacceptable. Our constituents deserve better!
One of the first letters I received in my office is from fourth grader Eva, who asked a great question about laws protecting bald eagles. Thank you, Eva, for coming to me with your question! Hope this answer helps.
Today we celebrate the life and impact of Dr. MLK Jr. His fight to guarantee equal rights for all Americans through peaceful protest, love of humanity, and a commitment to civility changed the face of our nation forever and inspired the world.

It is past time we come together in a bipartisan manner to fund the government and secure our border. If you believe that a common-sense legal immigration policy is in the best interest of our nation, I would urge you to review this plan, and do so without partisan goggles.
Excited to announce I'll be serving on the @FinancialCmte! I came to Congress to empower our economy and bring jobs to Northeast Ohio. Serving on the House Financial Services Committee will give me the opportunity to fulfill that promise.
The American people deserve is a good-faith effort from both sides to put partisan bickering aside and negotiate our way out of this shutdown. Read my op-ed in @clevelanddotcom here:
@CoachCirinoSHS @anthonygonzalez Would love to! Our office will reach out to make sure we get it on the books.

Thank you, Adam. Please spread the word. If there is a veteran in need, we are here to help!
Ohioans deserve a healthcare system that puts patients in the driver’s seat. Obamacare has been a disaster for Ohioans, but one positive aspect was that it stopped insurance companies from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions.
I'm proud to join @RepDaveJoyce on his bill to protect people with preexisting conditions in Northeast Ohio and across the country. Learn more here:
Our law enforcement works hard every day to keep our community safe. Thank you to all of our #OH16 law enforcement for all you do to protect our families.
I cannot sit by and collect a paycheck while some of my constituents are furloughed. Our nation’s leaders need to put aside partisan politics and come together and put forth a real bipartisan solution that will fund our government and secure our border.
Proud to announce I plan to donate my congressional pay for the shutdown period to a local NEOhio nonprofit that supports survivors of human trafficking, rape, domestic abuse and addictions. Read more here:
I’m proud to have voted on legislation today to help update Congress with new technology, streamlined administrative processes and improved staff recruitment to help our workplace reflect the diverse makeup of our country at large. #116thCongress
I came to Congress on a promise to make our government work for the people again, and a big part of that is bringing this governing body into the 21st Century. On my second day in Congress, it’s already clear that the modernization of Congress is long overdue.
I look forward to supporting those efforts.
The bill we voted on yesterday was neither a compromise nor a realistic solution to funding our government. Leadership from both parties need to come together and work in a meaningful bipartisan manner to fund the government and put our country back on track.
We have a responsibility to the men and women of this country to come together in a bipartisan manner to solve our big challenges. That starts with funding the government in a way that responsibly secures our border.
Proud to represent Ohio's 16th Congressional District in Congress. Follow me here for updates on my official work.
