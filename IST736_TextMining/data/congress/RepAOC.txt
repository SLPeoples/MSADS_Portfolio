I’m not shocked by much. But I felt ill watching GOP Oversight members try to delay subpoenaing DHS+others after multiple unfulfilled requests for info that could lead us to reunify lost children with their parents.Some issues are partisan. The urgency of this shouldn’t be.
A joint statement from the offices of @Ilhan @RepPressley @RepRashida and Ocasio-Cortez concerning the 2019 government funding package released this
Proud to stand with @SenMarkey and over 60 Original House Cosponsors today to introduce our #GreenNewDeal resolution for both the House AND Senate!You can read the official resolution
RT @RepRashida: Today was my first hearing on @OversightDems. We heard heartbreaking testimony from Mrs. Worsham, who lost one of her two i…
Today @OversightDems held its first-ever hearing on the skyrocketing costs of prescription drug prices.These new experiences can be a lot to take in, but it’s much easier with @RepCummings’ courageous leadership, our supportive colleagues, my desk neighbor � @AyannaPressley
The post-its outside our office are growing � thank you all for your continued support as we navigate and learn in these early days beyond!
Prior to our swearing-in, NY-14 casework was being fwded to @SenGillibrand. Thankful for her office’s continued assistance as we connect with those cases and sort out the large volume of requests we‘re receiving from in + outside the district!
We’ve been documenting the buildout on my Congressional Instagram (IG: @ repocasiocortez).In the meantime, we are setting up temporary offices and returning all NY-14 constituent calls.
Office update/NYC Rent life: although we attempted to take over our predecessor’s lease, the landlord wanted to almost double rent (from ~$7.8k/mo to $15k/mo).That spike would have meant less caseworkers for our community. Instead, we’re making a new space w/ a family business!
We at the House are doing *our* job passing bills reopen government, so why won’t @senatemajldr do his?We left to drop off letters to:- His Sen Majority Leader office- The GOP cloak room- The Senate floor- His Senate officeAnd he’s nowhere to be found. #WheresMitch?
I’ve been getting letters, visits, calls from workers and everyday Americans like this about the shutdown all week.They’re all saying the same thing: don’t give in, don’t legitimize hostage-taking of our paychecks, don’t let GOP do this to build a wall Americans don’t want.
It is a complete injustice that to this day, some American citizens do not have federal representation in government.It’s time for that to change. I am happy to sign on to #HR51 in support of DC statehood.
Thank you @townhallproject!
RT @TheRevAl: Great meeting with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez! After talking serious issues we lightened it up a bit and talked James Brown.…
It was an honor of a lifetime to meet with Rev. Jesse Jackson to discuss how we advance the movement for economic and racial justice in the United States.Rev. Jackson’s lifetime of civil rights work paved the way to make lives like mine possible. Thank you, @RevJJackson!
I just had a furloughed worker come visit me in my office.“I work for HUD,” he said. “My family is hurting now that I’m three weeks without a paycheck,”“but please - please don’t give into a wall. I don’t want the political tool of withholding my paycheck to be legitimized.”
