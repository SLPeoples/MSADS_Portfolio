Renewing confidence in our democracy requires a multifaceted approach I'm proud to support this important step in reforming our electoral process, restoring integrity to campaign finance promoting ethics.  Read my statement on the #ForThePeople Act
Today Democrats are answering the call from the American people to restore our democracy with a broad package of reforms to take on campaign finance regulations, expand voting rights, and improve ethics in all three branches of the federal government.
Today, and every day, I’m proud to stand in support of women around the world. When we invest in and empower women, we create safer communities, stronger economies, and a better world for all. #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2019
Better coordination within the U.S. government, and with civil society and international partners, is critical to tackling the complex challenge of preventing and reducing extremism around the world.
Instability in the form of conflict, famine, and disease around the world continues to foster extremism and leads to the displacement of millions of people.

It is dangerous wrong for the President to circumvent Congress by stealing funds from military readiness for his political agenda. I strongly support Congressman @JoaquinCastrotx's resolution to terminate the #FakeEmergency. We will continue to fight this unlawful power grab.
House Democrats are not going to stand by while the President abuses his power by declaring a national emergency to build his wall. This national emergency declaration is built on xenophobic lies and mischaracterizations about immigrants.
The vote today to terminate President Trump’s unlawful #NationalEmergency declaration sends a clear message to the President and this Administration that the new House majority is serious about oversight and accountability.

The law is clear about this now, and we’re going to keep fighting to ensure that DOD is able to account for those dangers.
It’s completely inappropriate for the administration to try to form a climate denial panel to try to cast doubt on the risks, and it could put us in a worse national security position where we’re not prepared for what is to come.
All manner of national security experts, Republican Democratic alike, recognize the empirical threat that #climatechange poses to our national security interests. Democrats got that fact enshrined into law in the 2017 NDAA - and Trump signed it.
The President has said he wants this border wall to protect us from a purported invasion. The law is very clear - if you are going to take money from the military construction budget, it has to go to protect US armed forces. If he takes this action, it will be illegal.
I’m pleased to see Washington State’s continued focus on improving infrastructure in the 9th District. The new I-405/SR167 Interchange Connector will help improve traffic in the Renton area for commuters and work to relieve congestion throughout the I-405 corridor.
It is also illegal. The law says you can only use money from the military construction budget to build something to provide protection for US armed forces. This wall has nothing to do with force protection.
It is not our top national security priority to build a wall at our southern border. Taking money from the Department of Defense for this purpose makes us less safe.

Read my full statement on President Trump’s Declaration of a #NationalEmergency
The President's appalling decision to declare a national emergency is a truly egregious example of putting his political agenda ahead of the interest of the US. From the beginning his obsession w/a border wall has been based on misguided anti-immigrant fervor, not nat'l security.
This conference report is far from perfect, but it must be passed for the sake of all that it supports: many dozens of government agencies initiatives, hundreds of thousands of federal employees the American public served by those workers agencies.

Our national priorities must include affordable #healthcare, fighting #climatechange, addressing the rising cost of #housing for middle class Americans, rebuilding our #infrastructure, and increasing access to #education.
On the heels of the longest shutdown in our country’s history, caused by the President’s arbitrary demand for billions to build his border wall, he should use this unique platform to talk about meaningful solutions to the true challenges facing Americans.
At tonight’s #SOTU, where President Trump will have the opportunity to lay out his Administration’s vision and plans for the coming year, I worry the President will once again prioritize appeasing his base instead of putting the interests of the entire country first.

Instead, we must support effective diplomacy, invest in our national security and propose smart policies to keep our country, along with our European allies, secure, free and prosperous.
Congress must not allow the Trump administration to plunge the United States into a 21st-century nuclear arms race. This dangerous policy would undermine our national security, divide us from our allies, play directly into Putin's hands, and place peace in Europe at risk.
Throughout this month, I will be highlighting African Americans from Washington state past and present who have broken barriers and challenged the status quo.
The month of February serves as a time to commemorate and celebrate the influential African Americans that have contributed to the incredible diversity and excellence of our country. Historian Carter G. Woodson led efforts to found what we now recognize as #BlackHistoryMonth.
By withdrawing from the INF Treaty instead of making an honest, good-faith effort to collectively punish Russia for its treaty violations and bring it back into compliance, we are playing into President Putin’s hands.
The Trump administration is needlessly ignoring the concerns of our allies and partners on an issue that should unify NATO, not divide it.
In my opening statement before this week’s committee hearing, I said one of the goals of the hearing was to set the factual record straight about the Department’s support on the southern border. We did not achieve that goal with the testimony provided by Secretary Rood.

Read my full statement on the Trump Shutdown the President’s continued border wall demands️
I continue to believe that spending billions on a border wall with no justification, especially in the wake of the GOP tax giveaway to the wealthy, is deeply irresponsible, especially as we have so many other worthy national priorities.
Our policy and legislative process does not work by holding the government hostage, and I hope the President has learned that doing so is unproductive and harmful.
Finally, after 35 days, the President has agreed to do what he should have done in the first place: open the government. The impacts of the government shutdown on federal workers and communities across the country have been immense.
I voted today to reopen @DHSgov until Feb 28th, and have previously voted to do so for the rest of government, while negotiations with the Administration continue. It is time to #EndtheShutdown
There is no reason why demands for a border wall should hold up funding for agencies that remain closed. Federal workers are not a bargaining chip.
The House has voted ten times to end the #TrumpShutdown and reopen the government, and today the Senate did not end the crisis. Ultimately, many federal workers are about to miss their second paycheck because Trump is not getting his way.
