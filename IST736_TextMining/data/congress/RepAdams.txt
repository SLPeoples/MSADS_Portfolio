Want to fight corruption? Raise wages? Lower prescription drug prices? First, we need to pass H.R. 1, the #ForThePeople Act, and ensure that working people their families are at the heart of the policy-making process
House Democrats are getting things done as the House Majority. Today we restored faith in American democracy by passing H.R. 1, which will protect voting rights and America’s electoral process. #ForthePeopleAct

Unmarked burial grounds are often discovered when construction inadvertently disturbs burials, creating heartache in the community. The African American Burial Grounds Network Act will help support the community efforts to address issues like
This bill will help communities preserve their local history allow descendants of those interred to visit/honor their family members, while also better informing development decisions community planning in growing areas like Mecklenburg County #BurialGroundAct #preservation
That’s why today, during #BlackHistoryMonth , I introduced the African American Burial Grounds Act with @RepMcEachin to create maintain a national network of African American burial grounds.
The graves of African Americans have too frequently been forgotten or neglected by the communities they’re located in. Even in cases where communities care deeply, they often don’t have the funds or technical assistance needed to preserve this.

Twenty-six years after the FMLA was signed, people need #paidleave, and a national plan like the #FAMILYAct would benefit them and their families, businesses and the economy. #Paidleave means everybody wins.
About 40% of the workforce isn't eligible to take unpaid leave through the FMLA. It's past time for a national #paidleave guarantee – the #FAMILYAct.
#Paidleave means the freedom to start a family if, when and how you choose. And it should be available to all women and working people, no matter where you live or work. #FAMILYAct
