Increasing the gas tax without meaningful reforms to infrastructure construction approval funding processes would result in a more expensive version of the status quo. Rural areas like #NE03 depend on quality infrastructure affordable fuels for economic development.
Thanks to everyone who turned out this morning for this week's #NebraskaBreakfast. Be sure to join @SenatorFischer @SenSasse @RepDonBacon @JeffFortenberry and me in the Dirksen Cafeteria on session Wednesdays at 8:00am if you visit Washington.
H.R. 1, proposed by House Democrats, is more about rigging elections than eliminating corruption. It limits free speech, weaponizes the FEC, funds campaigns with taxpayer dollars, and usurps the rights of states. #NOTforthePeopleAct

Thank you to the @BeatriceChamber and their Government Affairs Committee for meeting with me this morning. Yesterday, on the anniversary of the House passage of the Homestead Act, I introduced HR 1472 to support the community’s request to rename @HomesteadNM as a historical park.
Today the WTO released a report confirming what we've known for decades: China unfairly subsidizes its ag industry ($100 billion in a single year). Our ag producers will out-compete anyone on a level playing field and I appreciate @realDonaldTrump's efforts to level it.
Thanks @connellmcshane for having me on @AftertheBell @FoxBusiness to talk about @USTradeRep's testimony before @WaysandMeansGOP. @realDonaldTrump is making progress on China, Japan, and USMCA. I look forward to resolving current disputes/opening new markets for our producers.
RT @AftertheBell: .@RepAdrianSmith: I’m encouraged by US-China trade talks
I am steadfastly against any effort to abridge the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Crime cannot be solved by depriving law-abiding Americans of their right to defend themselves, their families, and their property. #2A
Today in a @WaysandMeansGOP hearing w/@USTradeRep, I expressed my support for trade deals with China to end our ongoing trade dispute and with Japan to expand market access for our producers. Section 232 tariffs on Canada/Mexico must also be lifted to allow consideration of USMCA
Good news from this morning’s Ways and Means hearing:  @USTradeRep Ambassador Lighthizer said trade talks with Japan would start soon.

The worst thing we can do for middle-class families is to take more of what they earn through higher taxes. Any changes to the tax code should help Americans help themselves, rather than collecting more money so we can grow government on the backs of hard-working Americans.

The Farm Bill conference report provides for a strong crop insurance program and creates a vaccine bank to help contain future incidents of disease. Nebraska’s producers have made clear they need the certainty of a long term Farm Bill and I look forward to its passage this week.
I appreciate @POTUS + @EPA taking action to roll back onerous 2015 #WOTUS regulations which were a gross overreach by the federal government. Farmers, ranchers, and state officials are willing and able to protect their non-navigable waters. This decision honors that commitment.
Thanks @sbstarherald for publishing my column remembering President @GeorgeHWBush this week. He was a good man and a lifetime public servant who will be missed.
Tomorrow, 12/7 is the deadline for anyone interested in sending greeting cards to members of our military through the @RedCross this holiday season. Feel free to drop them off at my Grand Island or Scottsbluff offices. #HolidaysForHeroes
Former President George H. W. Bush has arrived at the U.S. Capitol to lie in state until Wednesday morning. He will be missed.
Great to hear the White House announce a very positive step forward with China last night after its president agreed to purchase more US agricultural products and negotiate an end to its abuse of American intellectual property in exchange for a delay in tariffs.
I’m deeply saddened by the loss of our 41st President, George H. W. Bush. Navy pilot, congressman, ambassador, CIA director, vice president, and president, he was a true public servant and a great man who brought out the best in people. Our prayers are with the Bush family.
I commend @realDonaldTrump for securing an agreement which continues the success of NAFTA for Nebraska’s agricultural producers by modernizing trade relationships with America’s neighbors. I look forward to reviewing #USMCA in detail once submitted to Congress for ratification.
