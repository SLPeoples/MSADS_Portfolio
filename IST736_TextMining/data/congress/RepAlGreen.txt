If Rep. Steve King can be held accountable for his words, President Trump can be impeached for his bigoted
House of Representatives once again rejects white nationalism and white supremacy as hateful expressions of intolerance. If you reject bigotry, will you reject the bigot? #ImpeachmentIsNotDead
Mr. President, is it fair for hundreds of thousands of federal workers to be held hostage for 22 days and counting because of a wall that has nothing to do with their jobs and that you promised Mexico would pay for? #ImpeachmentIsNotDead
First the shutdown forcing hundreds of thousands of Americans to go without pay, and now the President wants to divert disaster relief funding to pay for a border wall that he promised Americans Mexico would pay for. Mr. President, you truly have no shame!
The humanitarian crisis at the southern border is rooted in the President's bigoted policies. If white babies were dying at the border, our response would be vastly different. One step closer to impeachment.
.@realDonaldTrump is correct in saying there's a crisis at the southern border. However, his deceitful projection of this crisis is inflamed by his policies rooted in lies and bigotry. The reality is this is a humanitarian crisis that begs a REAL humanitarian response NOT a wall.
On a 60 Minutes segment with Anderson Cooper, @AOC said that President Trump is a racist. SHE IS RIGHT! I would also add that he can and should be impeached for the bigoted policies emanating from his presidency. #CountdownToImpeachment #ImpeachmentIsNotDead

If President Trump compared persons of any ethnicity or religion to termites, I would call that statement bigoted. Since Minister Farrakhan has compared Jews to termites, I must call that statement bigoted. Bigotry is unacceptable regardless of the source.

Where was the outrage from Republicans when the President was advocating  police brutality and complimenting the bigots in Charlottesville?
Today America mourns the continual loss of humanity equality since @realDonaldTrump took office. The Trump v. Hawaii ruling legitimizes the attack on religious freedom the 1st Amendment by the Trump Administration. History will judge this decision. #WeWillNotBeBanned
Today I celebrate the LGBTQIA+ community as an ally strong supporter of liberty and justice for all. #PRIDEHOUSTON
Mr. President, you terrorized children with the family separation policy knowing the solution was in your hands. You demonize migrant families pretend to be their savior with a stroke of your pen. This is what xenophobia looks like. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead

Mr. Otting, discrimination economic disparity exist regardless of whether you've observed them during your 30 years in banking or not. The habitual blatant refusal to acknowledge the facts of discrimination in lending merely perpetuate this systemic racism. #OCCnoColor
Several Members of Congress I marched with @RepGutierrez to Customs Border Patrol HQ to protest the separation of children from their families at the border. We must speak truth to power denounce the wrongs of this administration at all costs. #FamiliesBelongTogether
This administration’s cruel immigration policies have been tearing families apart for too long. The barbaric practice of separating parents from children for simply seeking refuge must end because a great nation doesn’t divide; it unifies. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Mr. President, geopolitically speaking, those who sacrifice their tried true friends for untried, new friends may end up with no friends at all. #TrumpKimSummit
We march to honor the millions of women veterans in America. We march to show how far women have come as the fastest growing group among veterans. We march to show how far we have to go as women veterans face unique challenges after serving America w/pride. #WomensVeteransMarch
Mr. President, a pardon won’t bring back the countless minorities who make up 62% of unarmed persons killed by police. It won’t bring back Tamir Rice, Eric Garner, Danny Thomas, others. It won’t negate your comments that have incited harmful arrest practices among officers.
Mr. President, we have a duty an obligation to protest injustice when we see it. Peaceful protest is a right of all Americans. I salute @Kaepernick7 for his courage to peacefully protest the injustices against unarmed persons killed by police.
Today, several witnesses before the House Financial Services Committee blatantly denied the existence of invidious discrimination in lending in this country although evidence consistently supports it testing has revealed it.
Mr. President, you've shown us that you believe you have absolute power. America is not a monarchy. I introduced HJRes 115 in 2017 to deny you the power to self-pardon. Ben Franklin was right. "We have a republic if we can keep it." #ImpeachmentIsNotDead
Today we #WearOrange to bring awareness to the 96 Americans who die everyday due to gun violence and the hundreds who are left injured. We #WearOrange for victims at home, school, work, the movies, the park, anywhere we are not shielded from gun violence. ���
With record numbers of white nationalists running for office, America cannot allow bigotry to further invade Capitol Hill. Enough is enough. We have to destroy the belief that bigots holding political office is acceptable it starts with the President. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead
To whom it may concern, your efforts to suppress the legitimate impeachment of an unfit president are impacting the Democratic base. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead
If bigotry is justifiable grounds for firing #RoseanneBarr, then surely the same should apply to the President. We have reached a point where many will dare to call Trump's actions bigoted, but dare not call him a bigot hold him accountable. #ImpeachmentIsNotDead
.@TomSteyer I are fighting the good fight. We, along with millions of others, are committed to the impeachment of a person who is unfit to be President.  #ImpeachmentIsNotDead
Mr. President, take the time now to take heed to what I previously indicated to you in my March 10th tweet. You still have the opportunity to create a meaningful summit, not a meaningless photo op. #NorthKoreaSummit

.@SpeakerRyan bring the gun safety bills we have pending to the floor of the House for a vote. The American people need solutions, not just moments of silence for another group of victims. If you won't act, step aside. #ActionNotTalk #SantaFe #Parkland

One year and one day after I called for impeachment on the floor of the House of Representatives, my position is still the same. As long as President Trump occupies the White House, #ImpeachmentIsNotDead.
