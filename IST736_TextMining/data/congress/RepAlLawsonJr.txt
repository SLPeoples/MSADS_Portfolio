@James_Benderson Please feel free to contact my office:
It was great meeting you all.
What you all are doing is great! I will continue to do my part to increase research and find innovative ideas that can help make a difference in our fight to end Alzheimer’s.
@James_Benderson I am a proud cosponsor of the legislation. Background checks work, and they help to save lives. I think it is vitally important that we work to pass commonsense gun safety legislation.

I have long admired the @JUPublicPolicy Institute and the outstanding work that they are doing to educate and train the next generation of public policy and political leaders in our nation.
@msymtucker I've worked w/the Mayor to provide resources to the community – most recently, the $25 million BUILD Grant for transportation. But, it shouldn’t be about party affiliation. Our focus is ensuring you all have what you need to live productively and to make our communities stronger.
I had the opportunity to tour Tyndall Air Force Base to survey the damage caused by #HurricaneMichael with @DWStweets and Rep. @DrNealDunnFL2. Disaster supplemental funding is vital for our North #Florida communities to recover.

The power of prayer is a remarkable thing, our faith plays an integral role in how we live our lives. The annual #Tallahassee Prayer Breakfast gives us the opportunity to unite and pray for our community. Thank you to the organizers #TLH faith leaders for another great event.
I am pleased that we have reached an agreement to end this 35-day #governmentshutdown, the longest in U.S. history. This partial shutdown has been felt across our nation and caused significant damage to America’s families, businesses and economy.
My district staff helped to feed federal correctional officers impacted by the federal #governmentshutdown at FCI in #Tallahassee today. The food share program provided food for more than 150 correctional officers and their families.
@mike_debski @SenRickScott Mike, I am not accepting a paycheck until all federal employees receive their pay and the government is reopened.
In #Jacksonville, I met with Rhonda Taylor, one of #Florida’s 13,000 employees who may miss her 2nd paycheck due to the #GovernmentShutdown. I will continue to fight for Ms. Taylor the other 800,000 employees until we can get our government reopened. #GovernmentShutdownStories
I had such a great time participating in the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in downtown Jacksonville this morning. It was a little chilly, but that didn't stop the community from coming out in full force to celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. King. #MLK90

Today, a full-time worker making the $7.25 minimum wage has less buying power than that same worker in the 1960s. Gradually raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 would give nearly 40 MILLION workers a raise. That’s why I am proud to cosponsor the #RaiseTheWageAct.

The resolution is not the end of this critical conversation. It is vital that we have a full discussion in the next Congress on the crisis and work toward a reasonable solution that I hope will bring an end to the atrocities taking place in Yemen.
It's unfortunate my Republican colleagues played political games by attaching a measure as serious as the humanitarian crisis occurring in Yemen to the Farm bill. This was Congress’ last chance before the end of the year to provide much-needed relief to families through the Bill.
I’m pleased that the House has worked to provide certainty to those fighting hunger and farmers by passing a bipartisan Farm Bill. #FarmBill
I applaud the inclusion of $40 million for agricultural scholarships for students attending 1890 Land Grant Institutions in the #FarmBill. These funds will help future generations at schools, such as @FAMU_1887, continue to pursue careers in #agriculture. #HBCU #FAMU #Ag
