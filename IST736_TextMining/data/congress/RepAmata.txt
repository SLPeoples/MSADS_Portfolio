On this day in 1782, General George Washington created the Purple Heart Medal to specially recognize only those who were wounded or killed in the service of our country. The nation has honored these heroes this way since... This day and every day is a good day to thank a veteran!
Today is Purple Heart Day, honoring those throughout US history who were wounded or killed in the line of duty. Each one of them made this sacrifice in the worthy cause of freedom.
It was incredibly moving to observe these military honors. These soldiers sacrificed their lives in their youth or prime of life in service to our country and the cause of freedom, and we owe them a great debt.
This was a solemn occasion, but it is a welcome development that these soldiers are at last going home to families and descendants. Praying these repatriated remains will bring healing to these families, and be an important and lasting reminder of the sacrifice so many have made.
I was blessed to attend the moving military Honor Carry Ceremony at Hickam led by Vice President Pence and Admiral Davidson, and with Korea veterans there to receive back the honored remains of our fallen heroes repatriated from Korea after all this
