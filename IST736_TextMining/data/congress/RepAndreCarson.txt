Great to see more women running, winning and making a difference not only in Congress, but across Indiana. Happy #InternationalWomensDay to this group of legislators, the special women and girls in our lives, and all of the women who inspire us, today and every day.
So pleased the House passed #HR1 today. This is a big win for democracy! For too long, shady special interests have called the shots, using their pocketbooks to drown out the voice of the people. Today's vote represents a big step to end this culture of corruption. #ForThePeople
RT @Ilhan: Our nation is having a difficult conversation, but we believe this is great progress.
We must continue these tough but productive discussions about difficult topics— including Palestine and Israel. They won't be easy, but we must have them in order to steer our nation in the right direction.
We sent a clear message today that @HouseDemocrats are united in our shared opposition to hatred, bigotry and discrimination, but we can't stop here.
After more than a decade in Congress, this was my first opportunity to vote on a resolution that condemned anti-Muslim hate. As a Muslim-American, this is an important step in the right direction — to condemn hate in all its forms.
A reminder that this great event is happening soon! I hope to see you there.
Excellent! #VoterSuppression is real, and Congress must tackle it.
It is unacceptable that President Trump cancelled the annual report on civilian casualties from drone strikes. Drones can be an important counter-terrorism tool, but holding ourselves to a high standard means understanding their impact on innocent people.
Religious intolerance against all faiths must be condemned. Let's work to ensure our diverse beliefs are a catalyst for productive dialogue that acknowledges our shared humanity. Faith should not be a means to divide us.
We must always strive to be inclusive and tolerant -- understanding that our words hold tremendous power, and sometimes cause pain. But in doing so, we cannot shut down legitimate policy debate. @Ilhan has raised valid points about Palestine and Israel that should be debated.
I certainly respect spirited debate, but @HouseGOP's arguments opposing #HR1 on the House floor today are weak. If you're arguing AGAINST expanding voting rights and FOR dark-money special interests, you're not #ForThePeople. I'll proudly vote for it, and I hope they do as well.
#OTD in 2017, President #Trump issued his revised #TravelBan. The effects of this vile directive are still being felt -- families remain torn apart and our image around the world continues to suffer. We must keep working to end this testament to xenophobia and Islamophobia.

Thank you, @IndyUNCF, for a great time and for all the work you do to provide educational opportunities for students in our community. This annual event always reminds us that a mind is a terrible thing to waste!
During #WomensHistoryMonth, we honor all the women -- notable and unsung -- who have shaped America for the better. I'm privileged to work alongside a record number of women in Congress, and live among many more changing our world in countless ways. Your efforts mean so much.
Mark your calendars! My sixth annual Youth Opportunities Fair is happening soon. Don't miss out on this helpful event for students, parents and guardians, and check out this link for more information on how to prepare ahead of time. #CarsonYOF --&gt;
Tonight we came together to mourn the senseless death of fellow Hoosier, Mustafa Ayoubi, and to demand stronger protections for victims of hate crimes. We can’t wait a moment longer. #Justice4Mustafa
So pleased that the students at @GWContinentals as well as members of Team Carson were able to participate in this well-deserved #BlackHistoryMonth tribute. Gregory Hines is an icon of stage and screen who has captivated audiences for decades.
Today, Congress has the chance to make history by passing #HR8, a bipartisan bill expanding background checks. After endless mass shootings, this is a long-overdue step to help save lives and protect our communities. I'll proudly vote for it, and I hope my colleagues do the same.

Something is wrong when nearly 30 million people are uninsured in the richest country on Earth, and millions more struggle to afford their co-pays and deductibles. That's why I'm proud to cosponsor the #MedicareForAll Act to help ensure every American's right to health care.
The House just passed @JoaquinCastrotx's resolution terminating #Trump's egregious and reckless emergency declaration. We can't let him build his ineffective wall. We won't let him disrespect the separation of powers. Our country and its ideals must be protected.
One of the best things about my job is meeting folks from all walks of life who have traveled to DC. Today they include Indiana members of the @AmericanLegion, food security advocates from our district, and a family with Indiana ties visiting Washington. Have a great trip!
#Trump's recklessness has created a moment of bipartisanship: Both @HouseDemocrats AND the conservative House Liberty Caucus agree that his #FakeEmergency is a dangerous overreach. When both of these groups think something is bad, then you KNOW it's bad.
At @HouseIntel, listening to our panel speak on how we can better protect global democracy from the rise of authoritarian regimes, such as China and Russia. The future of peace and freedom relies on it.
Today, my @TransportDems will hold a hearing on the best ways to stop the harmful effects of #ClimateChange, which poses a growing threat to America's infrastructure. It's not too late to prevent its worst effects, but we must #ActOnClimate now to protect our planet and economy.
So pleased by this announcement! Rolls-Royce is a critical part of our community and world-class supplier to our troops around the world. This will be another significant investment for our community, creating good jobs for Hoosiers and keeping our military strong.
It was great meeting with Dean @RepVisclosky, @GovHolcomb and other members of Indiana's congressional delegation who are in DC today to discuss our shared priorities for our state. We may hold different views and represent different political parties, but we're all Hoosiers!
Just arrived in DC preparing for a busy week. One of the most important actions I plan to take is voting with @HouseDemocrats to reject the #FakeEmergency #Trump declared to build his unnecessary wall. We know this action isn't about keeping us safe, it's about getting his way.

It was an honor to join community leaders and keynote speaker, the amazing @amandaseales, for an annual celebration of #BlackHistory at Olivet Missionary Baptist Church. This year's theme, "Black Migrations," reminds us how far we've come and how far we must go to reach equality.
I have signed on to @JoaquinCastrotx's resolution that would terminate President #Trump's #FakeNationalEmergency. We must stop this costly, ineffective wall, as well as efforts to upend our government's separation of powers.

My heart breaks for Mustafa Ayoubi and his loved ones. This senseless murder appears to be spurred by hate and bigotry, like so many other heinous acts. It’s vital Indiana passes strong legislation that ensures victims of hate crimes receive the justice they deserve.
#Census2020 is fast approaching, and today I joined @IndyMayorJoe and other leaders at @indylibrary to kick off the effort to ensure everyone in our community is counted. The census helps determine political representation and resources, so it's critical our voices are heard.
Today is the #dayofremembrance, a time to reflect on the tragic internment of Japanese Americans during WWII. As we acknowledge this wrongdoing, let's also do more to recognize and stop injustice as it occurs. Only then can we stop the cycle of discrimination.

My statement on President Trump's pointless and reckless national emergency declaration. We must stop this egregious executive overreach:
As a former cop, I stand with the majority of Americans who support this policy. There is simply no reason for civilians to own these weapons of war that have caused needless harm to so many. Let's pass this important bill that can help save countless lives. It just makes sense.
After seemingly endless mass shootings, @HouseDemocrats are taking real action to stop the bloodshed. I'm honored to support legislation, introduced today, that will once again ban assault weapons.
One year after the tragic #Parkland shooting, we remember the victims and pledge to honor them, and all victims of gun violence, with action. This week, Congress is advancing legislation that does just that.

I’m joining my @TransportDems colleagues in thanking all of the aviation employees who worked without pay or were furloughed during the #shutdown, including safety pros like @PASSNational @NATCA. #AviationAtRisk
Hoosiers and workers across America are still recovering from the last #shutdown that cost our economy billions of dollars. President Trump, be a leader and do what's right for our country -- sign the bipartisan agreement that funds our government and avoids another catastrophe.
As tax season begins, more Americans are realizing the truth about the #GOPTaxScam. It was always a giveaway to the ultra-rich, and now people’s shrinking refunds are making that even clearer. We need tax policies #ForThePeople, not the wealthy.
ICYMI-
So sad to hear of the passing of my friend and colleague Congressman Walter Jones. I’ll miss his leadership setting party aside and standing up for what’s right.
It was an honor and a privilege to serve alongside @JohnDingell. He taught us how to stand up strongly for justice and opportunity for all people.
@Amtrak testified @TransportDems about possible changes to critical maintenance facilities like Beech Grove. I’ve asked for a more detailed briefing and will be working hard to make sure Hoosiers aren’t hurt by changes.
My former colleague and Transportation Secretary just testified @TransportDems — he said fixing our infrastructure is an American issue, not a partisan issue and I agree!  #TheCostOfInaction

It is an honor today to be chosen by my colleagues on @HouseIntel and Chairman @RepAdamSchiff to serve as Chair of the Counterterrorism, Counterintelligence and Counterproliferation Subcommittee for the 116th Congress.
Today is a historic day in the House, the first hearing on gun violence is happening today! #EnoughIsEnough
Too much of the #SOTU was a roadmap for @realDonaldTrump's divisive agenda. It pushed fighting imagined threats over creating opportunity for all. I hope we can rise above work on policies that move our country forward, like infrastructure, medical research national security.
Despite our differences, there are things we agree on.  It's time for us to find common ground on what really matters to American families (2/2).
Heading into the #SOTU and hoping to hear @realDonaldTrump put forth a real plan to avoid another #TrumpShutdown, address our nation's crumbling infrastructure and tackle common sense gun reform. (1/2)

Thank you to all the #Indy community service providers, local government entities and nonprofits who connected federal employees to vital resources today!
I am grateful the government will reopen, but today's deal is only for three weeks and we know it will take longer for people to recover the damages caused by the #TrumpShutdown. We must be clear for those struggling that we will not allow the government to close again.

I just voted for the 10th time this year to reopen the government.  @realdonaldtrump it is time to stop playing games. Hurting federal workers hurts our national security and our economy. Its time to #EndTheShutdown TODAY.
Day 32 of the #trumpshutdown. @realdonaldtrump and the Republicans controlled the House, Senate and White House for two years. Yet didn’t try to fund the wall. Did they know it was unpopular and would lose support?  This is clearly a political stunt. End the shutdown TODAY.
Today, we honor the legacy of a man who reminded all of us of our shared humanity by pushing love over hate peace over division. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s message continues to resonate today, inspiring us to set aside prejudices and pursue opportunity and justice for all.
This #TrumpShutdown is not a game. It’s having devastating real life impacts for hundreds of thousands of workers, many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck.
Welcome to newest Democratic Members of the House Intelligence Committee: @RepSeanMaloney,@PeterWelch,@RepValDemings, and @CongressmanRaja.I'm looking forward to working with each of you!
We are now on day 25 of the partial government shutdown. As a result, over 800,000 hardworking Americans are either furloughed or forced to work without a paycheck. Is the #Trumpshutdown affecting you? Make your voice heard by sharing your story here:

I just voted to pass spending bills for @USDOT, @HUDgov @USDA. These are about safe aircraft, safe food housing vouchers for low-income families. They have nothing to do w/ a wall shouldn't be held hostage. The Senate should pass them so we can end the #TrumpShutdown.
Let's get our government workers back to work. Today. #TrumpShutdown
(2/2) We need to fund our government so we can provide critical health and safety services. Only then can we tackle comprehensive immigration reform. #TrumpShutdown
(1/2) Tonight @realDonaldTrump stoked fear while Speaker Pelosi Senator Schumer laid out the facts. @realDonaldTrump manufactured a crisis at the border, and now 800,000 Americans are also facing a crisis due to Trump’s shutdown.

Merry Christmas! Special thanks to all the federal employees who are working without pay or are furloughed until the #TrumpShutdown ends. #MerryChristmas
Wishing each of you a blessed and happy holiday!
Border security is essential, but we shouldn't criminalize immigrant communities, militarize the borders or carry out policies that dont represent our values. Instead of funding a wall we should adopt comprehensive immigration reform to protect our border fix our broken system
Fact: a #Shutdown would force 420,000 federal employees to work without pay another 400,000 employees to be furloughed-right before the holidays. This is no way to run a country.
