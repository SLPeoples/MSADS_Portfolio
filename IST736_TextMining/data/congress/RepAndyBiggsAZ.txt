ICYMI: I wrote an op-ed for @FoxNews on the witch hunts in underway against @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. Democrats' animus toward this president is leading to an abuse of our political institutions in an effort to take down a political enemy.OP-ED:
Thank you to @club4growth for presenting me with the 'Defender of Economic Freedom' award this week. I strive every day to promote smaller government, pro-growth policies that will help the United States prosper for years to come.
America's national debt just surpassed $22 trillion. It will take more than promises to handle this security threat. There's a lot of work to do, we must save our grandchildren from this pending fiscal crisis.Watch my remarks at the @housebudgetGOP's annual Member's Day.
COMING UP: I’m joining @KristinFisher on @ANHQDC to talk about the House Democrats insatiable desire to lay the foundation for impeachment of @POTUS @realDonaldTrump. Watch at 12:10 EST on @FoxNews. #AZ05
A bigot who claims free speech must also accept the responsibility for that speech. Democratic leaders members who have chosen to support Rep Omar have utterly failed to show America that Congress will fight anti-Semitism.Read my @FoxNews op-ed ➪

NOW: I'm on with @JamesTHarris to talk about my vote to condemn Rep Omar's repeated anti-Semitism. House Democrats may not be willing to do what is right here, but I will with my vote. Listen on @KFYI. #AZ05
Americans should be disgusted by this charade of anti-Semitism. Burying this pattern is inexcusable, and I call on Democrat leadership to stop rationalizing and protecting this behavior. We should never resort to anti-Semitic rhetoric that is inflammatory and frankly, hateful.
Rep Omar should be removed from the Foreign Affairs Committee for her unrepentant anti-Semitism. Unfortunately, Democrats have no interest in backing up their soft rebukes with real consequences. In fact, they can’t even draft a resolution to condemn her anti-Semitic remarks.
Rep Omar has engaged in a consistent pattern of anti-Semitic remarks. Democrats forced an earlier conditional apology from her, only to find she was not sincere at all. Meanwhile, Speaker Pelosi empowers her voice – even appearing with her on the cover of Rolling Stone Magazine.
We are here today because a member of this body issued a series of anti-Semitic statements. Burying this pattern is inexcusable. I call on Democrat leaders to stop rationalizing this behavior. We should never resort to anti-Semitic rhetoric that is inflammatory and hateful.

One of the issues w/ the bill is the provision for millions of taxpayer $ to be funneled to campaigns around the country. You your neighbors will be funding candidates from sea to shining sea regardless of whether you agree with them or not. Don’t you have a problem with that?
H.R. 1 is a monstrosity of a bill, rife with problems throughout its hundreds of pages. So much so that Democrats rushed it to the floor with an alarming lack of mark-ups to hide its countless deficiencies.

These friendly faces from #AZ05 warm our hearts - we need it with the Arctic chill this week in D.C. Thanks to everyone who recently stopped by our office. If you are planning a trip to our nation's capital in the near future, please reach out to my office for tour assistance.
AZ voters enshrined the Independent Redistricting Commission into our constitution. HR 1, which should be the Democrat Politician Protection Act, would dismantle the will of AZ voters, moving all redistricting decisions to D.C. bureaucrats. That’s an abuse of the 10th Amendment.
Sure is.
Always a good discussion with conservative Members of Congress. Hope you'll tune in NOW.
What's taking place at our border isn't a manufactured crisis. It's a real crisis, overwhelming those at our front lines protecting us. For the safety of Americans those who are risking the elements cartels to cross illegally - I urge my colleagues to confront this crisis.

A bad border security deal is worse than no deal at all. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump, I encourage you to say no to this tentative deal, force Congress back to the table for meaningful security measures, immediately invoke your constitutional authority to build the wall.
Mary Ann Mendoza, I can't imagine the grief that you and your family endured - and remember every day - when Brandon was killed by an illegal alien. Our prayers are w/ you on this day. Your son was quite a man I would have been privileged to know him.
Keep fighting the good fight, @sherifflamb1. Thank you for your leadership.

Americans should be outraged when they learn about the border security provisions of this tentative agreement to address gov't funding border security. I urge @POTUS @realDonaldTrump to use the authority Congress has already delegated to the executive branch to build the wall.

It's becoming apparent (again) to Americans that Democrats are not interested in securing our border. They don't want to build the wall - even in strategic locations as requested by the Border Patrol; NOW they want to take away the abilities of ICE to detain illegal aliens.

COMING UP: I'm about to join @SandraSmithFox on @AmericaNewsroom to talk about the latest in border security talks as we inch closer to another gov't spending deadline. The Dems continue to move the goalposts as they put politics above national security. Watch on @FoxNews. #AZ05
The United States continues to make tremendous advancements in aerospace, and Arizona - and more specifically, #AZ05 - plays a significant role. More progress to come.
