There's a lot more to a Congressional office than what you see on @cspan. My team can help you with issues you might have with federal agencies like the VA or Medicare. Find out how here:
This week, @HouseDemocrats voted to give the American people the government they deserve – one committed to working #ForThePeople. It’s time for the Senate to do the right thing and bring this crucial legislation up for a vote ! #HR1
Earlier today, I was proud to speak before our final vote on #HR1 on why it's so important we stand up #ForThePeople. Now, it's the Senate's turn. It's time for Democrats and Republicans to come together, and pass reform now.
Finishing my week in DC before I head back home by responding to a few letters from our neighbors in #NJ03. My office has responded to more than 5,000 letters in the past two months. Keep writing! It’s always great to hear from you.
Taking a moment to honor #InternationalWomansDay and women who have helped make New Jersey and our country such an amazing place. It's important that this Congress stand united in protecting the rights of women and fighting for true equality.

We’re just minutes away from voting on #HR1, which will help heal our democracy and make it #ForThePeople. I joined my fellow freshman, @RepDeanPhillips to talk about why this is so important.
First amendment offered, first amendment passed. My amendment will make sure that our federal election ballots are #MadeInAmerica. #HR1 #ForThePeople
Proud to join Democrats and Republicans in standing up to hate, and voting to pass a strong resolution to condemn anti-Semitism and all bigotry.
Always great to listen to small business owners from across our country on what they need to grow. I look forward to seeing the @SBAgov continue to use the Microloan Program to create jobs in NJ.
Proud to stand with @StopBigMoney and my colleagues, @RepJasonCrow, @RepDavids @repdelgado @RepDeanPhillips @RepSlotkin @RepMalinowski @RepSpanberger and @RepMaxRose to stand up to big money in politics and advocate for #HR1 #ForThePeople.
If we're going to have a government #ForThePeople, we need our ballots made by the people. It's why I've introduced an amendment to #HR1 to make our federal election ballots in America.
Happening right now. Tune in and join the conversation on how we can use this great program to grow small businesses and create jobs.
So much of the work of my Congressional office isn't done in DC, but back home in NJ. I have a great team here if you need help on an issue with a federal agency. You can go to my website to reach my team for help.
...and protects access for voters to participate in our democracy, strengthens election security and improves ethics laws. #HR1 #ForThePeople

Proud to serve with these amazing representatives on @HouseSmallBiz!
This week, we're going to vote to pass the #ForThePeople Act, which will help clean up our democracy and put power back in the hands of the people. Today, I spoke on the House floor about why this is so important.
Thanks to @FrankPallone and @EnergyCommerce for holding the first legislative hearing today on the SAVE Act, which will expand access and lower costs. Proud to lead this effort with @RepBrianFitz to get things done on this important issue.
You can't build a business without building roads and information infrastructure first. Looking forward to this hearing today on the importance of #InfrastructureReform to our small businesses.
We have a real chance to pass legislation this week to make our government work #ForThePeople. Check out my op-ed in the @BurlcoTimes on why we need to pass #HR1.
The @DeptVetAffairs estimates that 20 veterans take their own lives every day. I commend President Trump's effort to establish a new task force to address this critical issue. We should bring a bipartisan approach to helping our
#AAPIEqualPay Day marks the day when AAPI women’s pay typically catches up to what the average man earned in 2018. It's past time to close the #wagegap and pass the #PaycheckFairnessAct.
We should carry on her legacy and make sure that everyone can participate in our democratic process.
Our health care system is broken for too many people. I introduced the SAVE Act because we can take steps right now to improve access and lower cost. Keep an eye on @EnergyCommerce for some news later this week.
Born in Mount Laurel, her legacy lives on at the @AlicePaulInstit. Give them a follow, go visit and let's move forward to ensure that every American who wants to participate in our democracy is not denied.
Alice Paul is a true New Jersey hero and the inspiration behind my bill to protect access to the right to vote.
When people in your community want solutions for something they deal with every day, it doesn't matter which party you belong to. Looking forward to moving the SAVE Act forward with @RepBrianFitz and taking action on the cost of health care.
Today is the 100th anniversary of Korea's First March Movement. I'm proud to introduce a resolution with @RepGraceMeng to honor its importance and impact.
It was great to take a few minutes today to chat with @RepBrianFitz, my partner on introducing the SAVE Act, which will expand access and lower health care costs. Look forward to getting this done together!

First bill. First floor speech. Big day today introducing the SAVE Act, which brings a bipartisan approach to increase access and lower health care costs.

Later today, I’ll vote to pass two bipartisan bills that will close loopholes and make our communities safer. Last week I met with @MomsDemand in our district to hear why this is so important. Proud to vote yes on these bills today.
I spent the last week listening to people throughout my district about the national emergency declaration, and I'm voting to stand up for our district.
I’ll be voting to protect critical resources for our Joint Base and stand up for Constitutional separation of powers.

Congress is back in session next week, but I was proud to listen to people from across our district this past weekend. Thanks to @jshoreonline for coming by!
From our Joint Base to prescription drug prices, I heard from so many of you this past weekend about the priorities of our district. I'm proud to bring those back to Congress to fight for you.
One of the most important things that any member of Congress does is help navigate red tape and other issues with federal agencies. If you have any issues with your Social Security, Medicare or VA benefits. Check out how we can help:
The concerns and ideas I heard this weekend at my town hall weren't partisan-driven, they were from people in our communities who want to get things done. Check out what I heard and how we can work together to make a difference for NJ families.
This weekend's town hall was a great opportunity to hear from you. Check out what I heard in @TomsRiverPatch and how I'll be bringing your fight back to DC.
Providing quality care for our veterans should be a top priority for our Congress and country. It's why I'm proud to push for a new facility in our district that can meet growing demand, and ensure that every veteran is cared for.
Had an opportunity to visit @LourdesHealth in Willingboro yesterday and listen to their nurses and staff about the contributions they’re making to our community. Thank you for your hospitality and insight!
Cherry blossom season in DC is only a month a way, and a perfect time to visit! My office can help set up a tour of the Capitol or the White House to make your trip to Washington special. Check out my website to find out how.
Today is #PresidentsDay and an opportunity to reflect on the things that make our democracy so special. It's up to us to fight for it, and that's why I'm a proud co-sponsor of #HR1. It's time to make our government work #ForThePeople.
From lowering prescription drug costs to expanding access to VA care, I heard a lot from you at our town hall on Saturday. We can find solutions to these critical issues by working across the aisle and putting people first.
Missed my town hall yesterday? Catch up in nine easy steps thanks to the @AsburyParkPress.
Yesterday I heard the concerns of so many of you about making Congress work. The only way we can do that is by making it work for us. That's why I co-sponsored #HR1. Because it's time to make the government work #ForThePeople.
Town halls are an opportunity for me to hear from you. To bring your priorities back to Congress and fight for our district. Check out what I heard in yesterday's town hall and how I'll fight for NJ families.
Just finished my second town hall and wanted to thank everyone who came out and shared their ideas on how to make our district even better. Look forward to bringing them back to Congress and working for you.

Looking forward to hearing from people across our district at tomorrow's town hall. There's a lot of work to do, and it starts by listening. Hope to see you there.
This is what I came to Congress to do, and I will work hard to deliver on that promise.
I hope this is a new day for our Congress. From here, we must move forward and work together to lower prescription drug costs, clean up corporate influence in our government, support our military and empower our small businesses.
I just voted on a bill that would avoid a #GovernmentShutdown and keep the government open. This should be the last time we vote to avoid a shutdown at the 11th hour. We should always be able to come together to find common ground and get the job done.
Later tonight I’m going to vote to keep our government open and avoid another #GovernmentShutdown. I’m looking forward to getting back to work and delivering for our district.
Getting big money out of our politics isn't a Democratic or Republican issue, it's an American issue. I'm proud to be a co-sponsor of #HR1 and look forward to voting to pass it through the House.
One year ago today, 17 lives were lost at MSD. It's important that we listen to the survivors and help them carry forward their efforts to make sure this doesn't happen again. Great job by @mikiebarb in bringing that conversation
Our Congress can't work unless it works #ForThePeople. That's why I'm proud to co-sponsor #HR1 and am thrilled to see it discussed in @HouseAdm_Dems today. I look forward to voting for it once it reaches the House Floor.
Thanks to @Mulshine for sitting down with me to hear about my priorities and plans for delivering for our district.
Yesterday on the House Floor, we observed a moment of silence for the 17 lives lost a year ago today at MSD. My thoughts are with them today, and those carry on the fight for common-sense measures to make sure this never happens again. #MSDstrong
The American people don't want another #GovernmentShutdown. It's why I co-sponsored the #SEASAct, to make sure we talk through our differences instead of having them put working people's paychecks at risk.
I had a chance today to listen to J. Kelly Conklin, a small biz owner from NJ, on what the @HouseSmallBiz can do to empower and better serve New Jersey small business owners.
Working families in New Jersey already pay their fair share. Why would we make it harder for them to make ends meet? It's time to restore the #SALT deduction and help families in our district.
Have you filed your taxes yet? The IRS is reporting that refunds are down 8.4%. That’s money out of your pocket. It’s why I’m proud to stand with a bipartisan group to restore our #SALT deductions and help New Jersey families.
I couldn’t do this job without listening to the people of our district. That’s why I’m proud to announce my second town hall, this Saturday at 1pm. Visit my website at for details.
Thanks for stopping by and sharing your insights on how we can help support small businesses. Excited to bring that to my colleagues on @HouseSmallBiz.
As the father of two young kids, I know the importance of #paidleave for New Jersey families. It's why I'm proud to support the #FAMILYAct to make critical support more accessible to working Americans.
We have to do everything we can in Washington to make sure we’re delivering to the people of New Jersey. Check out my call for Congress to pass the #SALT Act in the @BurlcoTimes:
I came to Congress to get things done for my district. It's why I'm proud to join Democrats and Republicans in supporting the #SALT Act. We need #TaxFairness now.
I was proud to stand with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle yesterday to promote true #TaxFairness for New Jersey families. The time is now to pass the #SALT Act.

Today is the start of National Salute to Veteran Patients Week, which gives us a chance to say thank you to the millions of veterans who have served, and rededicate ourselves to making sure they have the best medical care possible at our VA facilities.
We're a little more than four days away from another #GovernmentShutdown, but it doesn't have to be this way. It's why I proudly co-sponsored the #SEASAct to force both sides to find solutions instead putting thousands of families at risk.
I'm proud to have joined @BillPascrell @FrankPallone and @SenatorMenendez today to address this issue and bring #TaxFairness to New Jersey families.
I'm proud to have just voted to pass HR840, which expands child care services for our veterans. This is a proven approach that helps those who have severed our nation, and we must continue to find ways to improve services for our vets.  #ChildCare4Vets
Was proud to meet yesterday with Amb. Cho from @RokEmbDC on the importance of our strategic alliance and the work still to be done.
Our veterans have sacrificed so much for us, they deserve to have everything they need to follow their dreams and build small businesses to create jobs and grow our economy.
The subcommittee hearing is underway. Tune in and hear from leaders in our underserved small business community on how we can work to help create new opportunities in our district and across the country.
Getting ready to step into the Committee room to start this important hearing and wanted to share a few thoughts. Look forward to hearing from the small business owners on our panel.
Excited to chair my first subcommittee hearing. Even more excited to do so on a topic that impacts so many small business owners in our district.
Too many Americans suffered during the government shutdown. I joined my colleagues at @HouseSmallBiz today to listen to small biz owners on the risks of another reckless shutdown.
I just finished a hearing with the @HASCDemocrats on our country’s efforts to fight terrorism. Having a sound, responsible strategy is the best way to keep our country safe and honor our service members.
I want to thank Petty Officer Thornton and the @USCG again for being my guest at the #SOTU. His service, and the service of all our men and women in uniform, is an important part of what keeps our country great.
We can tackle these challenges together with both civility and strength. I will continue to lead on these important issues and hope to see action from leaders of both parties that will make a positive impact in the lives of people in our district.
We can work in a bipartisan way to lower prescription drug prices, take dirty money out of our political system and give power back to the people, address an opioid crisis that is crippling our communities and deliver for our men and women in uniform.
Some thoughts post #SOTU:  I came to Congress to deliver for the people of New Jersey’s Third Congressional District. If the President is serious in his calls for more bipartisan action, the time is now to show those calls are more than just empty talk.
Heading over to the Capitol with our guest, Petty Officer Thornton, after a great conversation about the importance of service for the people of New Jersey. #SOTU
Petty Officer Thornton represents the best of our district. Check out the story from his amazing rescue of a sailor in need last year, and watch this space for more ahead of tonight's #SOTU.
Proud to have USCG Petty Officer Eric Thornton from Manahawkin as my guest at the #SOTU tonight. His story is an example of what happens when we put service first.
From my family to yours, and to families across New Jersey’s Third District, happy #LunarNewYear2019!
I visited the VA facility in Brick, NJ today to advocate for making the best medical care possible for our veterans a priority. If you’re a vet in need of help, visit our website to see how we can assist you:
Proud to stand with @RepMalinowski and a bipartisan group to stand for a responsible foreign policy that ensures that when we ask our servicemen and women to serve, it’s done with our national security, and not politics, in mind.
No one wins in a government shutdown. I'm proud to join my freshmen colleagues to introduce the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns (SEAS) Act to make sure working men and women don't suffer if we have another shutdown. #HR834 #NoMoreShutdowns #SEASact
Congratulations to our first photo contest winner Karl Jonsson, whose “Whitesbog, NJ” photo is a great reminder of the history and natural beauty that surround us in New Jersey’s Third District.
My statement on the end of the harmful government #shutdown that has impacted so many families in New Jersey.
Cold weather was no match for the warmth inside the celebrations honoring MLK, Jr. on this day of service. My gratitude to Second Baptist Church Toms River, Friendship A.M.E. Church in Browns Mills Parkway Baptist in Willingboro for being stewards of service in their community.
Tomorrow, fed workers, incl many in NJ, will miss their paychecks for the 1st time since the shutdown. The pain hardship is unnecessary, unacceptable affects many of those protecting our country our borders. I stand w our workers by not taking a paycheck until they get paid
Seeing @SteveScalise @GabbyGiffords embrace on the House floor last night was deeply moving. Today, I’m pleased to join @HouseGVP cosponsor the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. My full statement #updatebackgroundchecks #hr8 #gunsafetynow
As promised, the very first bill I cosponsored today was HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, which makes major, meaningful reforms to strengthen our democracy by fighting dark money in politics, increasing election security, improving voter registration enacting serious ethics reforms.
After 2 great days listening to constituents, I'm heading back to DC soon. But first, I hope you'll check out my new cover photo. From the river to the shore, NJ03 is a special place to have been raised I'm even luckier to be raising my boys here. Hope you'll share your faves
I hope you can join me for my first set of Burlington County office hours tomorrow in Willingboro.
