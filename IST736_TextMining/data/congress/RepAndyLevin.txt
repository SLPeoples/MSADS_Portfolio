On #InternationalWomensDay, I want to recognize some of the women in my life who have made me who I am.

As a newbie here, I have to say how impressed I have been by the job @RepSarbanes has done assembling this majestic bill and @RepZoeLofgren has done in shepherding #HR1 through the process. It has been so open and we have allowed and debated so many amendments. #ForThePeople
Casting my vote #ForThePeople of #MI09 for #HR1 may be my proudest moment yet in Congress. Anyway, I feel like a kid ready to go up to bat in the last inning of a little league game. Let’s hit a homer for the American people!!
As the last amendments are debated on #HR1, I’m simply over the moon. The fact that I have a bill to direct sunshine into corporate money in politics and an amendment to make sure state redistricting commissions are clean as part of the whole thing - I can’t quite believe it!
Also at our celebration of #HR1 is my old law school buddy and lifelong fighter for the people Rob Weissman, now at @Public_Citizen.
I’m so excited to celebrate our coming vote on the #ForThePeople Act with Wendy Fields, a dear friend going back to my days at the @AFLCIO when she was a @UAW lead on our organizing project in Stamford, CT.
I'm really grateful that the Democratic Caucus came together and passed a resolution that expresses our most fundamental values and our unified opposition to all forms of hate and intolerance.
I’m so proud of all the work that has gone into #HR1. I’m proud too of my amendment that would increase transparency in our democracy. But today, Republicans attacked my provision and defended corporate dark money. So I spoke up #ForThePeople.

Thank you @mippadvocates for hosting me at Planned Parenthood in Ferndale to talk about the Trump Administration's dangerous gag rule, which will harm patients’ ability to make fully informed health care decisions. #NoGagRule
Thanks for the paçzki @RepDebDingell! The perfect way for a Michigander to celebrate Fat Tuesday.
I’m a first-time elected officeholder who came to Congress appalled at the way dark money and special interests distort our democracy. Later this week, I’ll proudly vote for the #ForThePeople Act, or #HR1, to clean up the culture of corruption in Washington.
This #WomensHistoryMonth, I salute and thank the amazing women who have led the fight for gender equality. I will continue working as a proud ally to make sure women everywhere have equal pay, paid family medical leave, comprehensive health care!
I’ve become aware of yet more racist, Islamophobic attacks and death threats against my colleague Ilhan Omar. Imagine being under daily assault. There should be no place for these threats of violence and hate in our country; they are not part of any healthy political dialogue.

Today, we took common sense action that was long overdue. #HR8 is the most effective way we can start saving lives and begin to #EndGunViolence in America. My full statement:
�Spot on.
Health care is a right--not a privilege for only the wealthy. The time has come to ensure quality, affordable health care for every American. I’m so proud today to join @RepJayapal and over 100 of our colleagues as co-sponsors of the #MedicareForAll Act.
Beyond the fake emergency’s unconstitutional nature, it is disgraceful that the President would divert money away from military construction projects that are vital to the advancement of national security.
Just voted in my first markup for the @EdLaborCmte. So proud to bring the Rebuilding America’s Schools Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act to the House Floor. Investing in K-12 and tackling the pay gap are long overdue. The new Democratic House is really starting to cook!
Excellent news for #MI09! @FCAGroup is making big investments in its Warren plants that are expected to add 1,500 new jobs and increase production of electric vehicles. Growing good Michigan manufacturing jobs is a very smart move.
For strong public schools, we must support our educators. That includes valuing all school employees—like paraprofessional, clerical, transportation, food, custodial, and security workers. That’s why I proudly voted to establish a program recognizing classified school employees.
The President cannot fake a national emergency to subvert the will of the American people. My colleagues and I stand in solidarity to protect the Constitution against this president. #ForThePeople
I will do my constitutional duty and vote to protect the separation of powers. Trump’s #FakeEmergency is an unconstitutional power grab that must be stopped, and I am proud to stand in solidarity with hundreds of my colleagues who agree. 
Every patient deserves to hear all their options. The Trump Administration gag rule blocks doctors from giving their patients just that — ethical, quality care. This is unacceptable. #NoGagRule

Exactly @LeonardPittsJr1 – let’s revive American ambition to greatness and transformational policy!  I experienced just that feeling last night at the Huntington Woods Library for a #GreenNewDeal forum w/ @Detroitunionist and Molly of @sunrisemvmt. 
I’m excited to see Macomb ISD take a leadership role in developing a new STEM culture, including innovative curricula. They are committed to working with employers to ensure students are training for the best engineering and tech jobs available locally. 
I was already so concerned about the idea of Trump selling nuclear technology to the Saudis that I have been planning to introduce a resolution to address it. And now this! We will redouble our efforts.
I'm heartbroken by news of the terrorist attack in Jammu Kashmir. We must gather everyone in the community of nations to condemn such attacks whenever they occur. Rather than letting conflicts fester, let us address them steadfastly and through peaceful negotiations.
Uh, hello, that’s precisely what happened. The President didn’t get what he wanted, so he’s grasping for magic wands to get some money. What he is trying to do is illegal because (a) there’s no emergency, and (b) he is simply making an end-run around Congress's decision.
Today in his press conference, President Trump admitted that he "didn't need to" declare a national emergency. Sure doesn't sound like an emergency to me. Sounds more like an unconstitutional move to circumvent Congress that we will fight tooth and nail.

I don’t believe in the “great person theory” view of history. Change comes from movements of people banding together, not from any one individual. The #OneFairWage movement is how we will secure a fair, living wage that gives dignity to workers their families. @nwlc @rocunited
Today, I introduced the Transparency in Corporate Political Spending Act to help power H.R. 1, our overall bill to expand our democracy. Secret corporate spending poses a threat to investor confidence and to our democracy. #ForThePeople
I heartily applaud @gretchenwhitmer’s plan to make MI the first Midwestern state with debt-free community college. I look forward to working with state and local governments to meet her goal of 60% of adults in Michigan having post-secondary credentials.
We are the only country in the world that shuts down over a policy disagreement. I say no more. I reaffirmed my commitment to keep the government open and federal workers working at the @AFGENational District 7 breakfast this morning.
I was so disappointed that the plane I was on with other Members of Congress couldn’t land in Detroit for John Dingell’s funeral. Still, it was moving to be with so many who were intent on traveling to be with @RepDebDingell and honor Mr. D.
The President’s decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement brought international embarrassment to our country and diminished our ability to lead globally. What a huge mistake.
I have officially filed my first bill. During his recent government shutdown, the President quietly finalized a new rule that weakened workplace injury reporting requirements for most employers. I’ve filed a CRA resolution to restore those protections to help keep workers safe.
I am upset and concerned by the use of an anti-Semitic trope, especially by a Member of Congress. We must loudly reject any such expression of anti-Semitism, like other forms of bigotry. My full statement:
Has our nation ever had a more worldly-wise and wry a public servant than Mr. D? Has any man ever had a more rock solid partner than Mrs. D? Godspeed, Dean of the People’s House.
To me, John Dingell represents the House itself, in all of its dignity and downhomeness. He mastered and enjoyed it all: the policy, the process, the relationships.
As a two-time cancer survivor and father of sons with Crohn’s disease, I know well the financial threats to workers with pre-existing conditions. I’d like to thank Chad Riedy, a man living with #cysticfibrosis, for his testimony before the @EdLaborCmte.
My primary concern is will continue to be that workers impacted by this transition, along with frontline vulnerable communities, are seated at the center of the table as we discuss the resources policies to effectuate change we need to save our species our planet. (8/8)
Today we embark on a journey that will reveal once again the unbounded creativity, innovation and entrepreneurship of the American people as we develop the technology, grow millions of new jobs and meet this challenge. (7/8)
Just as we responded to the Great Depression with the New Deal; just as we responded to Pearl Harbor by mobilizing our entire country and so many allies; and just as President Kennedy said we would go to the moon when we didn’t know how, but landed there a decade later... (6/8)
However, in crisis I see overwhelming opportunity. (5/8)
Unfortunately, we have waited until the 11th hour to take this seriously enough to have any hope of keeping global warming to less than 1.5 degrees Celsius, which itself will inflict massive and problematic changes on the planet. (4/8)
The future of humanity, the future of a multitude of other species and the future of our wondrous variety of ecosystems depend on bold and unprecedented action, which we’re starting right now. (3/8)
For over 30 years, the scientific community has understood the need to fundamentally transition everything about how we live, work, play and move about our planet in order to protect life on Earth as we know it. (2/8)

Listen live now! �
SOTU = empty calories. I feel like I just ate a bunch of potato chips, Twinkies and pop tarts.
@POTUS trotted out one tear-jerking patriotic story after another. They were touching, but where was the *policy* to help our kids, protect seniors or advance freedom justice? It’s all symbolism. Empty calories. Not to mention totally divorced from his track record.
I can’t believe I’m here listening to the POTUS champion a new nuclear arms race, bragging that we will outspend all others. That’s a prescription for disaster. I hope I can contribute toward a more peaceful direction from the @HouseForeign Asia and Nonproliferation subcommittee.
It feels sickening to sit here — as a two-time cancer survivor — and listen to a man who has repeatedly proposed cutting the National Institutes of Health budget use the story of a child cancer survivor for applause. What has he done to speed cancer research? Nothing!
On Capitol Hill before the State of the Union with two superstars I admire so much: @AOC and Ghana Goodwin-Dye, the president of @UAW Local 909 and my guest for the #SOTU
The President’s agenda has been failing middle class families for two years. Tonight, he’ll try to pretend otherwise. We need an economy that works for everybody, not just the people who are already at the top. The President just doesn’t seem to understand that. #SOTU
I love everything about this, @gretchenwhitmer: the name, the leader, the consolidating and lifting up of clean water and clean energy in one smart package—at once a hyper-urgent moral imperative and a tremendous economic opportunity. Let the EGLE take flight!
Tomorrow, I will be joined at the SOTU by @UAW Local 909 President Ghana Goodwin-Dye. There's nothing more important to me as a person, as a Michigander and as a member of Congress than protecting the rights and dignity of hardworking people like Ghana and her fellow members.

The U.S. should be pushing hard for a multilateral effort to keep Russia moving in the right direction on arms control. Secretary Pompeo’s announcement represents a huge mistake for American security and global peace. My full statement on the INF Treaty:

Fellow Michiganders in #MI09, PLEASE remember to turn down your thermostat if you can stand it so that everyone can have heat. A fire at a Consumers Energy facility means they have less natural gas to go around.Keep those pets warm, too!

It’s not complicated: equal work deserves equal pay. I’m proud to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairness Act.
If we rebuild America’s schools, we can rebuild the middle class! A historic investment in our country’s public school infrastructure would be transformative for economic mobility. That’s why I’m cosponsoring the Rebuild America’s Schools Act. #RebuildAmericasSchools
Mexico posted its highest ever trade surplus with the U.S. — $1,800,000,000 for December. Doesn’t seem like Trump’s NAFTA 1.5 is going to help American workers!
More good news: I was named to the @HouseForeign subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, the subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Civilian Security, and Trade. I’m passionate about the issues covered by each and looking forward to working on both for #MI09!
Join us for a coffee hour in Warren on 2/5 at the Dovetail! 
Honored to serve as @EdLaborCmte Vice Chair and help @BobbyScott make sure that our country, our economy and our education system work for every American—not just a wealthy few.
I was so bummed to miss a snow day at home with Molly. I hope I *never* stop loving �.  But I decided to hightail it back to DC last night to beat the storm. This new congressman is not about to risk missing a vote on behalf of the citizens of #MI09!
The CBO estimates that President Trump’s shutdown did $11 billion in damage to the economy. It’s wildly irresponsible of the President to threaten another shutdown after learning its impact on working families and the broader economy.
Even though this @BerkleySchools Bear had to throw a little shade on the surplus @Seaholmhs pride, the focus on public education today was tremendous, and @RepHaleyStevens and I will be your champions on the @EdLaborCmte.
Today I honored the 3 G’s of my dear friend @RepHaleyStevens.Gusto: no one brings more energy to the new class. Grit: Haley was unwavering during shutdown, organizing our class, knowing that unity was our strength. And genuineness: in her relationships and in her policy focus.

Good riddance. My full statement on the state of the government shutdown:
The President's temper tantrum is grounding flights. He must end his shutdown,
It’s Day 34 of the senseless Trump-McConnell shutdown, and also the eve of another payless payday for hundreds of thousands of federal workers. As of today, the House has passed 10 bills to reopen the government. It’s time to end this. #ForThePeople
This is not okay. The President and @senategop are putting Americans in danger while @housedemocrats have passed 10 bills to reopen the government. What will it take to end this tantrum?
I’m so looking forward to seeing you at my first Macomb coffee hour. I’m eager to hear your thoughts and about what’s going on in your communities, while offering an update on what’s happening in Washington.
As angry as I am about the #TrumpShutdown, I am inspired in equal measure by the reaction of people in #MI09 like @OakGovMeisner and @davidwcoulter who want to help impacted federal workers.Today I voted for the 10th time to reopen the government. #Day33
We must redouble our efforts to support equality for transgender Americans so they can serve, work and live with dignity. SCOTUS did NOT decide the merits of the case, so the cruel ban will go into effect while cases wend their way through lower courts.
I couldn’t imagine a more inspiring start to my congressional career than today’s coffee hour. The people of #MI09 are so engaged and passionate about such a broad range of issues, from reopening the government to education to health care to reforming our democracy.

I’m getting my social justice batteries recharged on #MLKDay in #MI09 today, deepening my faith in the contribution the next generation is already making and is sure to make in the years to come. @BerkleySchools @RoyalOakSchools #mcmabreakfast
As we celebrate #MLKDay, let us redouble our efforts to meet hate with love and confront injustice and racism. It seems the president’s belittling of Native Americans and others has had an impact on his followers, to the detriment of our kids and us all.
Imagine negotiating with someone who steals your car and your TV set and then offers to return them to you as a “compromise." It was Donald Trump who ended DACA and TPS. Now he offers to “fix” those programs in exchange for getting his border wall.
The President must re-open the government so we can move ahead with important policy discussions, including border security, and restore certainty to the hundreds of thousands of working families that are hurting because of his shutdown.
The President can make bad-faith appeals on national television as many times as he likes, but Americans know the truth that he willingly and proudly shut down the government after not getting what he wanted.
I saw so many friends from #MI09 and beyond as we all recommitted to the struggle to expand women’s rights and power. #WomensWave #WomensMarch2019
After another week of fighting to reopen the government, I got such an instant energy boost walking into the electric Women’s March Detroit. It was both an honor and great fun to introduce @SenStabenow, an outstanding leader among the most diverse Congress in history.
This is deeply troubling. If a president instructs his attorney to lie to Congress, he is committing a very serious crime—a crime that cuts to the quick of the very integrity of our democracy. That is not something Congress could let stand, regardless of party and politics.

Thank you to the city of Ferndale and Mayor David Coulter for helping our #MI09 families during the #TrumpShutdown. @realDonaldTrump, please reopen the government so our cities aren’t forced to allocate resources to relief like this.
As we work to restore economic mobility and rebuild the middle class in America, we must make sure that a full-time job guarantees the ability to live with dignity. The #RaiseTheWage Act is good policy for working families and I’m proud to cosponsor it.
The earring and leather jacket would have been a nice touch in my official portrait. #AgingChallenge
I’ve spent my career advocating for workers’ rights, effective worker training programs and an equitable education system, and I’m thrilled to continue that work as a member of the Education and Labor Committee. (6/6)
My primary focus as the congressman from Michigan’s 9th District is to help rebuild the middle class by making every policy decision about raising the standard of living for working people. (5/6)
The skyrocketing cost of higher education is making it harder for parents to send their kids to college, and college graduates who have paid their way face immense burdens of debt. (4/6)
Our students in K-12 schools are not getting the resources they need to be successful, and policymakers are not listening to the educators and specialists who work hands-on with students every day. (3/6)
Despite a lifetime of hard work, most older Americans don’t have the savings to retire with dignity. Our economy isn’t working for all Americans as real wages are stagnant. (2/6)
I came to Congress to tackle the big problems that are keeping working families from prospering. (1/6)
This is great news, but the fight is not over. Proud to be a new member of the @ProChoiceCaucus ready to take on the Trump administration’s dangerous anti-women agenda.
On Friday, I met with federal workers on their #paylesspayday caused by  the senseless #TrumpShutdown. I’ll be headed to the House Floor shortly to share what I learned about how it’s imperiling working families.
You won’t find me driving a Volkswagen, Toyota or Kia until their workers have collective bargaining. I came to Congress to fight for workers’ rights and living standards, and I’m not going to be shy about it.
I was also quite frank with leaders of German, Japanese and Korean companies about the need to allow their workers to unionize as freely here as they do at home. They were polite, but clearly surprised.
I loved the new @Chrysler, @Ford and @GM products we saw at the @NAIASDetroit. I discussed with industry leaders the need for rapid adoption of clean energy systems — incremental change won’t do! We *must* lead the way on electric and autonomous vehicles.

Day 20 of the #TrumpShutdown, we take to the streets!
I joined my sisters and brothers in labor, marching from @AFLCIO to the @WhiteHouse to demand that the president and the Senate #StopTheShutdown.
I'm proud to be joining @HouseDemocrats in introducing  HR 1, the #ForThePeople Act – our plan to make public servants actually  serve the public.
I'm so glad I got to meet the incredible leader and advocate @NARAL President @ilyseh tonight, and I'm excited to support her work as a part of the pro-choice majority in the House!
On Day 19 of the #TrumpShutdown, I gave my first ever remarks on the House Floor condemning the emergency that the President has created by thrusting working families into financial instability.
On my way to speak on the House Floor for the first time as a Member of Congress to call for an end to the senseless #TrumpShutdown. Watch live at
45 wants you to believe that our country is in crisis. It is, but not for the reason he claims. It’s in crisis because more than 5,000 federal workers in Michigan are furloughed or working without pay, their paychecks becoming political bargaining chips.
The President's lies tonight didn't change the fact that American families are hurting because of the #TrumpShutdown. Enough.
5. Trump's wall ≠ border security.
4. The crime rate among immigrants is significantly lower than among native-born Americans.
3. Kids are being brought into this country by their familes, not by coyotes.
2. A border wall won't stop drugs.
1. Mexico won't pay for his wall, directly or indirectly.
Some simple but essential fact-checking following President Trump's speech:
What an honor to join Mother of the Movement Rep. @lucymcbath_ and other freshman to meet @AMarch4OurLives organizers @davidhogg111 @JaclynCorin @charlie_mirsky and @mattlpost. Our youth finally have a Congress that is ready to listen and to fight for common sense gun laws.
On the 18th day of the #TrumpShutdown,  I’m thinking of the 1 in 2 babies born in Michigan who receive vital nutritional assistance, a program which could lose funding if the  shutdown continues. We must stop this!
To mark Day 17 of the senseless #TrumpShutdown, @RepKatiePorter from #CA45 joins me to explain the devastating impact it's having on working families.
I'm so proud of @GretchenWhitmer. Already, she's proving that she'll be a governor who is a champion for all Michiganders. Protections for LGBT folks are long overdue, and I'm thrilled she secured them so quickly — and in #MI09 no less!
It’s Day 16 of the #TrumpShutdown, and I’m calling on the president and the Senate to reopen the government before tax returns are impacted.
Trump said he’s willing to drag out negotiations for months or years if he doesn’t get his way. 38,000 people in #MI09 who rely on SNAP benefits are facing food insecurity over this tantrum. We must end the #TrumpShutdown — and soon.
It’s Day 14 of the #TrumpShutdown, and you’ll hear from me every day until the president agrees to end this inhumane hostage situation.
