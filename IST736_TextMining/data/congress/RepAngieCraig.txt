Argosy University’s Eagan Campus is facing closure, leaving hundreds of MN students unsure of how they will continue their education. Some members of the MN delegation and I sent a letter to Betsy Devos to find out what the Dep. of Education plans to do on behalf of students.
Happy International Women’s Day! Today is a day to honor all of the women who have paved the way for a more equal, just society and to remind us of the work still left to do - including equal pay for equal work and ensuring paid family leave for every working family.
I was elected to make sure that our government works to strengthen communities give every family the opportunity to earn a good life. Proud that my resolution to remove conflicts of interest in Congress make sure government works #ForThePeople just passed the House today.
I’m so proud to have been a part of a historic vote to pass H.R.1, the first piece of legislation I cosponsored in Congress. H.R.1 will make it easier to vote, get rid of dark money in politics, and keep government working #ForThePeople #HR1.
Communities in #MN02 were hit hard by floods last year. In addition to finding bipartisan solutions to strengthen infrastructure prevent future flooding, it’s important for our communities to be prepared. Head here to find resources for flood insurance.
My bi-partisan bill to clean up local waters is being discussed in a @TransportDems hearing today! Proud to see such a critical bipartisan effort to protect our communities’ natural resources moving forward. I’ll continue to work with anyone to strengthen communities in #MN02.

When more people have access to mental health services, our communities are stronger, safer, and healthier. Proud of folks in Washington County working to increase access to these services and reduce the number of people with mental illnesses in our jails.

When you’ve worked hard your entire life, it’s only fair that you receive the retirement security you were promised. That’s why I cosponsored the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act, a bipartisan bill to protect pensions and ensure financial stability for retirees.
I’m honored to be in Selma today with @RepJohnLewis to remember the bravery of those who fought for the rights of every American to vote. Today, as we cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge, I remember how far we’ve come and how much more work we have left. #FPICivilRights
This attack on my colleague @Ilhan is unacceptable. Hate in all forms is wrong.  We are better than this, even if we disagree we must do so with civility. Anything else threatens our values.

Today wraps up National Career and Technical Education month, but tomorrow we cannot forget the importance of supporting the innovative programs that help prepare our students for the high-quality jobs of today.

Thank you to the staff at Regina Hospital for talking with me about your work to keep our communities healthy and thriving.
This morning I kicked off my healthcare listening tour in Eagan with a meaningful discussion about working together to lower healthcare costs. Washington could use a little more of the Minnesota common sense I heard from these folks when looking for solutions to this issue.
Workers should never be forced to choose between their job and taking care of a new child, family member, or their own health. That’s why I’m a proud cosponsor of the #FAMILYAct to create a national #PaidLeave program.

We cannot be complacent in the face of tragedy. We must work together on common sense gun reform and commit to the safety of our families and communities.
Yet again, innocent lives were taken today in Aurora, IL in a senseless shooting. I’m sending my deepest condolences to the families and my deepest gratitude to the officers who threw themselves in the line of fire to help their community.
I’m at the Library of Congress to start the Surplus Book Program for #CD2. I can’t wait to visit libraries and schools in the district and start donating books.
The opioid crisis cuts across communities all over Minnesota, devastating families and communities. I’m proud to be working with this bipartisan group to find real solutions for Minnesota families.
I voted on a bipartisan funding package that avoids another shutdown by strengthening border security and our immigration system. It's time to get to work on issues facing CD2: lowering healthcare costs, investing in infrastructure and supporting local communities and economies.
One of the most important issues we can come together on is lowering costs of and increasing access to healthcare. Next week I will be kicking off listening sessions across CD2 to engage communities and partners in finding real solutions to bring back to Washington.
On the anniversary of Parkland, we must reflect and remember the lives of those lost and impacted by senseless shootings across the country. I’m a proud cosponsor of H.R.8, a bipartisan common sense background check bill that’s now one step closer to becoming law.

This morning I had a productive conversation with @MAKMinnesota about how we can work together to improve highways and bridges in the 2nd district.
I visited the State Capitol this morning to meet with our Second District state legislators. I am honored to call these dedicated leaders my colleagues and I look forward to working with all of you to support working families and communities across the district.
After ice fishing, I headed over to @mn_mainstreet for a warm cup of coffee and spent #SmallBusinessSaturday talking with Tracy about running a successful small business and how we can work to support our local economies.
The best way to brave the cold weather is to spend the afternoon ice fishing with my neighbors in Lakeville. I wasn’t lucky enough to catch anything, but I got to catch up with the coolest community!
6M veteran households have children - thousands are forced to reschedule or cancel important VA appointments because they lack childcare. Today I voted for a bill that would eliminate this barrier and ensure reliable childcare for veterans across Minnesota. #ChildCare4Vets
Just gave a floor speech on my commitment to strengthening the middle-class by focusing on issues families across CD2 are talking about around their kitchen tables every night. Watch here:

Great to see the students from Faithful Shepherd Catholic School today!
Access to rural healthcare is one of the biggest challenges facing communities in the 2nd District. I met with folks from the MN Department of Health who are leading the effort to find solutions and make sure everyone, no matter where you live, has access to high quality care.
After tonight’s #SOTU, I’m committed as ever to working hard on behalf of every Minnesotan - to giving every family a fair shot at economic security, high-quality education, and affordable healthcare.
My State of the Union guest Katie Brenny and I had a chance to talk about what we hope to hear from the President’s address this evening.
I’m on the Agriculture Committee to open up markets for farmers and make sure they can access the resources they were promised in the Farm Bill. I met with @mncorn today to talk about how we can work together to make the voices of Minnesota family farms heard in Washington.
Can’t thank Dakota County Commissioners Atkins and Workman enough for a meaningful discussion today. I look forward to being your partner on federal transportation and infrastructure investments and keeping our communities thriving.
I’ll always stand up to put people above politics. That’s exactly what the Shutdown to End All Shutdowns Act does. #SEASact
I’m proud to work across the aisle with @RepPeteStauber to ensure the federal government upholds its commitment to funding special education, because all of our students and school communities depend on it.
Thrilled to Co-Chair @HouseNewDems Healthcare Task Force! I grew up for part of my childhood without access to health insurance. I know it’s time to reduce the cost of health insurance, including premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and lower the actual cost of healthcare.
I am honored to have Katie Brenny from Mazeppa, MN join me as my guest for this year’s State of the Union. Katie is a cattle farmer, businesswoman, and community advocate, and I could not be more excited to have her representing the Second District this Tuesday.
I joined my neighbors for an afternoon of bagging groceries for The Open Door Pantry. Events like these are a great way to get involved in our community. Thank you so much for having me!
The weather is warming up - just in time for another great #SmallBusinessSaturday. Thanks @LoonLiquors for sharing your small business success story with me. Let’s work together to keep small businesses thriving across the 2nd district!
I’m glad to see Minnesota dairy farmers will receive the assistance they need through this new program. I look forward to ensuring the program runs smoothly through my position on the Agriculture Committee.
I am proud to be a champion for strengthening Social Security. I signed on as an original cosponsor of the Social Security 2100 Act, which would strengthen economic security for our seniors and keep this vital program financially stable for generations to come. #Secure2100
Yesterday I gave a floor speech on the #SEASact, a bill I introduced that prevents future shutdowns by shifting the financial burden of a shutdown from federal employees to Congress and Executive Branch officials.
I’m about to talk with @Pdouglasweather and @JordanaWCCO on @WCCORadio. Listen here:
Thanks so much to President Shelley Buck and Cody Whitebear from Prairie Island Indian Community for meeting with me today. I look forward to continuing to work together to strengthen our tribal communities across Minnesota.
I’m an original cosponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct, which was introduced in Congress today. It’s long past time to strengthen working families by ensuring a woman receives the pay she deserves for doing the same job as the man working next to her. #EqualPay

I’m back in Washington this week to ensure that no party ever shuts down the government over a policy dispute again. Hardworking federal workers and their families deserve better.

Every day The Open Door puts our community first by providing healthy food to our neighbors in need. Today, I joined them to volunteer to serve our community in honor of the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Honored to speak at the Red Wing MLK Day breakfast and celebration held in Dr. King's honor. It was wonderful to be in the 2nd District as we reflect on the strength of our communities, progress we’ve made, and the work yet to be completed to continue his legacy of service.
Thank you for joining me and the team yesterday at our district office in Burnsville! Stop by during the week to get to know the staff - and let them know how they can help.� 651-846-2120 � M-F 9 am - 5 pm (12940 Harriet Avenue South, Suite 238, Burnsville, MN 55337)

Thank you @GovTimWalz for prioritizing the needs of Minnesotans during the shutdown. We have been working to immediately reopen the government, and we will keep working tirelessly to make sure our constituents have access to the relief they need during these uncertain times.
I joined @BettyMcCollum04 to meet with federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay. I’ve voted 8 times to #EndTheShutdown and joined colleagues to hand deliver a letter to Leader McConnell urging him to pass these bipartisan bills and reopen the government now!

I've talked to many hard-working federal employees who work and live in the Second District about the hardships this shutdown has caused for their families. Have you been affected by the shutdown? Tell me below or share your stories here →
Join me on Saturday, January 19th from 2:00 to 4:00 pm at my District Office - 12940 Harriet Avenue South, Suite 238, Burnsville, MN 55337. We will be collecting non-perishable food donations for local food banks. Bring an item to share!

This is what leadership looks like. I'm honored and humbled to work alongside such an impressive and dedicated group of women. Let's get to work.
Back in D.C., enjoying the snow and fighting to reopen the government - put hardworking federal employees back to work, restore pay for thousands of Minnesotans and end the hardship and uncertainty this shutdown has caused for millions. #EndTheShutdown

It’s a wonderful #SmallBusinessSaturday. Got the chance to stop by Quaint and Quirky in Hastings and visit with Jodi, the owner. Even picked up a new piece of art for my office.
A productive conversation with Hastings Mayor Mary Fasbender about this fantastic community. Infrastructure, housing, and health care are all priorities. Can’t wait to work with you, Mary!
I just signed onto a bill that makes sure that Congress doesn’t get paid if the government is shut down. Until we get the government back up and running, it’s just wrong for us to be paid while federal workers struggle to pay their bills.
Today thousands of Minnesotans are missing their paychecks because of the shutdown. That’s unacceptable. We should not be playing political games with people’s lives. We need to #EndThisShutdown.
I just gave my first floor speech about the stories I heard from Minnesotans keeping our skies safe impacted by the shutdown.
Today I voted to reopen the government and make sure that no farmers are denied the relief they rely on, and no family or child in Minnesota goes hungry. We must end this shutdown now.
I voted today to end the shutdown so families aren’t at the risk of being evicted. This shutdown has caused too much uncertainty for Minnesotans.

Thanks @MNcounties for visiting with me in Washington. I look forward to working with you and I’m proud to represent six of MN’s best counties – Dakota, Goodhue, Scott, Wabasha (and parts of) Rice and Washington!
It’s an honor to be here with @GabbyGiffords. It’s time that we pass common-sense gun safety legislation to make our communities safer.
Always happy to say hello in the second district - thanks for letting me stop by the St. Paul Park City Council meeting last night!
5,280 hardworking Minnesotans are not getting their paychecks. It's time to end this shutdown now.
I won't accept a paycheck during this or any shutdown where federal employees are not being paid and services are limited to Americans. I’ll be donating my salary to Eagan Open Door Pantry and Wabasha Food Shelf.
I just met with air traffic controllers in CD2 who are not being paid because of the shutdown. It’s time to put an end to this senseless shutdown, pay our federal employees and give Americans the certainty they deserve.
Congratulations to my friends @GovTimWalz and @LtGovFlanagan on your swearing-in today! I know you will be tireless champions for MInnesota and I’m looking forward to working with you to move our great state forward.
The inauguration is off to an excellent start with Prior Lake High School’s Wind Ensemble!
We must end this shutdown now and provide certainty that hard-working families will receive their tax refunds on time, that farmers get the relief they are counting on and that federal workers again get paid for their work.
I believe that Americans deserve an effective, efficient and modern government that reflects the many advancements we’ve made over the years. That’s why I voted to establish a special House committee to make sure this is a top priority for this Congress.
In December I helped introduce the framework for the For The People Act, H.R. 1, and today I signed on as a cosponsor to fight to take the dark money out of politics, restore confidence in our government and make sure that your voices are heard.
RT @RepAngieCraig: My colleagues and I just voted to re-open the federal government, allowing tens of thousands of hard-working Minnesotans…
My colleagues and I just voted to re-open the federal government, allowing tens of thousands of hard-working Minnesotans to go back to work and restore their pay. Now it's up to the Senate to do their job.
On the first day of the 116th Congress, the House passed the first step toward restoring our fiscal responsibility. I will always fight to make sure Congress spends tax dollars wisely.
Today, I was sworn into the 116th Congress. It’s our job to work to ensure every Minnesotan has access to affordable, quality health care, to invest in the infrastructure of our communities and to prioritize career skills and technical education again.
Hello! My official twitter account @RepAngieCraig is live. I'll be sharing my work in Congress with you here.
