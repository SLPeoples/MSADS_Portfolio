On #InternationalWomensDay, I’m grateful for the advancement of women around the world, but women still face major challenges. Discriminatory laws limit women’s opportunity. Governments must act to uphold equality and close the opportunity gap.

My statement regarding H. Res. 183 - Condemning anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim Bigotry
Today I’m proud to introduce new legislation to restore Net Neutrality protections that were repealed by Trump’s FCC. We must #SaveTheNet and keep it open to all Americans without any manipulations.
Wonderful meeting with the @BLMca team, the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band, and Santa Cruz Supervisor @RyanCoonerty on the Cotoni-Coast Dairies lands last Friday to receive an update on the efforts to create public access to this National Monument.
Last week I met with @NIHDirector and the new Director of @NIBIBgov, Dr. Tromberg. My bipartisan legislation created NIBIB to advance biomedical technology for breakthroughs in medicine. Fascinating discussion on how @NIH is harnessing new technology to find cures for Americans
15 governors and the American Medical Association have voiced their opposition to the policy. It’s clear Trump’s move will harm public health. We must #SaveTitleX
The Trump Administration is pushing a reckless policy that threatens essential Title X health care services by limiting the providers who can participate in the program. This will severely restrict Americans from accessing basic health care.
Title X funding provides access to essential services, including breast cervical cancer screenings, affordable birth control, STI tests, family planning services and other critically important healthcare services for 4 million Americans, with not one cent used to fund abortions

I’m following the testimony of Michael Cohen closely. He has confirmed that Donald Trump knew about Julian Assange’s plans to release stolen emails during the 2016 campaign. The truth matters, and this Congress is dedicated to transparency and upholding the Rule of Law.
For the first time in over a decade The House will take up gun safety reform, and I will vote to pass #HR8 to strengthen the background check system and close dangerous gun sale loopholes. Thank you to @MomsDemand for your fearless work to end gun violence. You inspire me!
The votes are in. The House has overturned the President’s unconstitutional emergency declaration. A majority of Americans oppose the declaration, and nearly 60 national security advisers have spoken out against it. It’s time to end the #FakeEmergency
The U.S. Constitution is clear—Article One states that Congress controls the power of the purse. Today I will vote to uphold the Constitution by preventing the President from unlawfully taking money that Congress already appropriated. Congress The People do not support the wall
When the Supreme Court gutted key parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, it gave way to greater discrimination and the denial of the sacred right to vote. I’m very proud to be an original cosponsor of HR 4, The Voting Rights Advancement Act, to protect voters and #RestoreTheVote
Proud to dedicate the second Fisher House at the Palo Alto VA today!
Here we go again. Another day of the Trump presidency, another violation of our Constitution #FakeTrumpEmergency
Broadband providers should not be allowed to block websites they may not like, or discriminate against services and content that compete against their own. Today @EnergyCommerce held a hearing about the importance of restoring strong #NetNeutrality protections for all Americans.
For too long unreasonable forces have prevented serious consideration of virtually any gun legislation in Congress no matter how common-sense it is. That era is over. Today @HouseJudiciary is holding a hearing to address gun violence in America #TakingAction #EndGunViolence
Next week the Health Subcommittee will hold a legislative hearing on proposals to undo the Trump Administration's sabotage of the ACA.
Health care was the single most important issue to voters in the 2018 election, yet the #ACA is still under attack nearly ten years after the landmark bill was signed into law.
Today the @EnergyCommerce Health Subcommittee is holding its first hearing of the 116th Congress today to examine the impacts of the Texas v. United States court case on the #ACA and on Americans with pre-existing conditions.
Every American has a right to avoid unwanted and unsolicited robocalls. Today I introduced the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act with @FrankPallone to strengthen enforcement of robocall regulations and give consumers the right to revoke consent they may have given to receive calls.
Oral arguments kicked off today in @mozilla's suit to overturn @AjitPaiFCC’s irresponsible repeal of net neutrality. Americans deserve a free and open internet, which is why @SenMarkey and I led an amicus brief w/103 members of Congress supporting net neutrality principles
Social Security is the most successful social insurance program in the history of our country. For 84 years, it has provided an unbroken promise of financial security to millions of Americans, including more than 100,000 beneficiaries in my Congressional District. #Secure2100
Today on FDR’s birthday I introduced the Social Security 2100 Act with @RepJohnLarson to strengthen benefits, cuts taxes for seniors, and ensure this program remains solvent for the next 75 years. No one should retire into poverty after working their entire life #Secure2100
Today I joined @SpeakerPelosi to introduce the Paycheck Fairness Act to end the gender pay gap. 56 years after JFK signed the Equal Pay Act into law, women still earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. Women and men doing the same job deserve the same pay. Period. #EqaulPay

The ongoing war and humanitarian crisis in Yemen is horrendous and I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that the U.S. is not complicit in human rights violations in Yemen.
Of all the mistakes I could make, this one bothers me to no end, because I’m an unswerving cosponsor of H.Con.Res.138 and feel very strongly that the U.S. should immediately withdraw all military forces from the conflict in Yemen.
I thought I was voting on a suspension bill, and I have since submitted a statement for the Congressional Record reflecting that I intended to vote against the rule.
On November 14th I mistakenly voted ‘aye’ on a rule stripping ‘privileged’ status from H.Con.Res. 138 which requires the President to withdraw all U.S military forces from the conflict in Yemen.

We’ve made progress but there’s much more work to be done. I’m proud every day and especially on #WorldPancreaticCancerDay to help lead the charge in Congress to push for federal investments in biomedical research until we find a cure.
My 2012 bill, the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act requires the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to examine its current research efforts on cancers w/very low survival rates, including pancreatic, to develop early detection methods treatments to improve outcomes.
#PancreaticCancer is the only major cancer in the U.S. with a five-year survival rate for only 9 percent of those diagnosed, and it’s on track to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. by 2020.

I’ve introduced a new bill to reauthorize the PREEMIE Act because every child deserves a healthy start to life.
The PREEMIE Act, my legislation that became law in 2006, expanded research, education and intervention efforts to reduce preterm births and improve treatment for premature infants and their mothers. This important law was allowed to expire last September.
Today, one in ten babies are born prematurely which puts them and their mothers at an increased risk of complicated health problems.
November is Prematurity Awareness Month, a national initiative to raise awareness about the crisis of preterm births in our country. For the first time in almost a decade, the rate of preterm births began rising in the United States in 2015.
To all who celebrate this joyous festival in my Congressional District and around the world, may your Diwali be filled with light, happiness and hope for the future.
Today is the first day of Diwali, the Hindu, Jain, Sikh and Buddhist “Festival of Lights.” During Diwali, families and friends come together to light oil lamps called diyas which represent the triumph of good over evil.
I’ve introduced the Election Day Holiday Act with @RepMcEachin to make Election Day a federal holiday so more Americans have the time they need to vote and participate in our democracy.

Congress should pass my legislation, the Presidential Tax Transparency Act to require the President to release his tax returns, ensuring that the highest office in the land is held to the highest standard of transparency.
The American people have no way of knowing the magnitude this loophole represents to the President without the release of his tax returns.
President Trump has more conflicts of interest than any president in our history. According to his candidate filing w/ the @FEC, he has 564 financial positions in companies in the US around the world, including relationships w/ state-affiliated businesses in several countries.
A new report from the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) shows that a loophole in the Republican tax law could make some of the President’s foreign income from his businesses around the world virtually tax-free.
We must end discrimination against LGBTQ individuals in employment, housing and education. I’m committed to achieving these civil rights and grateful to have the Human Rights Campaign as a partner.
I’m so proud to have earned a 100% score from the Human Rights Campaign on their Scorecard for the 115th Congress. We’ve made great strides in recent years striking down discriminatory policies targeted at the LGBTQ community, but we have more to do.
The science is clear. We must enact policies to protect our planet from the existential threat of climate change, including putting a price on carbon, recommitting the U.S. to the Paris Climate Agreement, increasing fuel efficiency standards, and investing in clean energy.
In it they warned that by 2040, 50 million people will be displaced by rising sea levels, 350 million people will endure severe drought, and more than a billion people will experience extreme heat waves unless we act now to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
Last week, the U.N. released a gripping report about climate change.
The growing federal deficit threatens funding for vital programs that keep us healthy and safe, and adds to the national debt which our children and grandchildren will have to pay for.
The Treasury Dept just reported that the federal budget deficit grew to an astounding $779 billion in FY2018, an increase of almost 17%. The massive increase in the deficit is a direct result of the massive tax cut legislation that Republicans rushed through Congress last year.
RT @RepMcEachin: That is why I introduced a bill with @RepAnnaEshoo that will require us to treat Election Day as a holiday.

I’m proud that the Know the Cost Act, legislation I introduced with 9 colleagues to eliminate gag clauses was signed into law last week. By lifting these outrageous restrictions, this legislation will help families in my District across the country to save costs of medications.
‘Gag clauses’ prohibit pharmacists from telling patients when they can pay less for their prescriptions by paying out of pocket, contributing to the rising cost of prescription drugs.
Our country’s immigration policies should reflect our values. Instead, this rule punishes those who are trying to pursue the American dream.
The rule is designed to clearly disallow immigrants from seeking the health care food assistance they their families may have an urgent need for.
The Trump Administration has proposed yet another cruel rule that restricts immigrants’ access to green cards if they have used Medicaid and SNAP.

Most offensively, the new tax cut package makes the $10,000 annual cap on the State and Local Tax (SALT) deductions permanent. Nearly 200,000 households in my Congressional District deducted an average of $31,193 in SALT in 2015. This is yet another assault on the middle class.

Congress must move quickly to protect the Special Counsel from any obstruction so the American people get the full truth of Russia’s interference in our national election and any crimes the President may have committed.

In a democracy, there should be many voices to the many, not fewer and I'm glad that this mega-merger is dead.
