We need to empower our addiction workforce by equipping them with the tools they need to fight the opioid crisis. I’m proud of the work the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force is doing to support those on the frontlines in NH and nationwide so we can combat this epidemic effectively
Recently had the honor of listening to @RepJohnLewis share his account of the 1965 civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, AL. This weekend’s @FaithNPolitics Civil Rights Pilgrimage serves as an important reminder of how far we've come and how far we have to go.
These reforms are necessary so the American people know we are putting their best interests 1st. I’m committed to fighting for all Granite State families by lowering the costs of healthcare Rx drugs, growing an economy where everyone can get ahead protecting our environment
Today I voted to restore power to the people by supporting the #ForThePeople Act. I’ve heard from Granite Staters who are tired of business as usual. This bill will get dark money out of politics, increase accountability for elected officials, protect access to the ballot.
It’s an honor to serve w/ a record number of women in the 116th Congress. On #InternationalWomensDay we celebrate milestones like this the incredible contributions women have made throughout history. We've made great progress but must keep fighting for gender equality. #IWD2019

This is heart-wrenching and completely unacceptable. As a mother, I cannot imagine being forcibly separated from my children. The Trump Administration must work to ensure that these children have the opportunity to be reunited with their parents.
Proud to stand alongside my @HouseNewDems colleagues to endorse HR 1 HR 4 - transformative legislation that will give regular Americans a seat at the table restore the integrity of our democracy. We are ready to deliver on our promise show that we are working #ForThePeople

NH needs long term funding so health care providers and first responders can combat the opioid epidemic effectively. Proud to join @SenatorShaheen @SenatorHassan and @RepChrisPappas to call on @realDonaldTrump to prioritize funding to end this crisis.
As @realDonaldTrump continues to attack access to quality, affordable health care, I'll keep working to lower costs help ensure all Americans can get medical care they need. I'm proud of the work @EnergyCommerce is doing to strengthen our healthcare system.
Harassment in the workplace is unacceptable, yet it affects Americans nationwide across industries. I'm proud to co-sponsor #EMPOWERAct, bipartisan legislation to help combat this pervasive issue by reducing barriers that prevent survivors from speaking out seeking justice.
.@realDonaldTrump #TitleX gag rule undermines the purpose of this program hinders initiatives that have led to significant progress nationwide. Women families deserve access to a full range of healthcare services. Attacking their care is unacceptable.
Proud to stand w/@HouseDemocrats cosponsor H.R. 1, the #ForThePeople Act, which the House will vote on later this week. This legislation will protect expand the right to vote, make government more transparent accountable help level the playing field for all Americans.
On this day in 1933, Frances Perkins was appointed by Pres. Roosevelt as Secretary of Labor, making her the 1st woman to serve in the U.S. Cabinet. During #WomensHistoryMonth, we celebrate trailblazing women like Frances, who fought for workers’ rights we take for granted today.
The decline in the number of opioid prescriptions written by dentists is encouraging shows importance of medical providers discussing a full-range of pain relief options w/patients. However, more needs to be done to prevent addiction curb opioid crisis

Incredibly powerful testimony by @vickycornell about the devastating impact of substance use disorder and the struggle of her late husband Chris Cornell of @soundgarden. We must eliminate the stigma that exists around addiction. Watch our discussion here:

I've joined my colleagues to introduce this resolution to block President Trump from raiding critical resources for our military drug interdiction efforts for his medieval wall. We need 21st Century solutions at the border. @realDonaldTrump is chasing a failed campaign promise.
On this day 63 years ago, the #MontgomeryBusBoycott protested an unjust, segregated public transit system. May we be inspired by the sacrifice, courage determination of those Americans who fought to make progress for future generations. #BlackHistoryMonth
This is an ideological attack on the right of women, men families to access a full range of quality and affordable reproductive healthcare services. This decision will jeopardize the ability of millions of people to discuss all healthcare options with their doctors.

Great to hear the thoughts of Granite Staters at my town hall in Plymouth this evening. I look forward to sharing their insights with my colleagues as we continue working to combat the opioid epidemic, lower the costs of healthcare and Rx drugs, and fight for NH priorities.

There is no emergency at the border. If anything diverting $2.5 billion from existing drug interdiction efforts to build an unnecessary wall will create an emergency. We need 21st Century border solutions. @realDonaldTrump’s plan is nonsensical, political will make us less safe
The President failed to convince Congress or the American people of the need for his wall and this move is a blatant effort to circumvent the will of Congress and the people.
I’m committed to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact effective, comprehensive reforms that will truly address the challenges faced by our immigration system.
Nearly 90 percent of illicit narcotics cross the border through ports of entry and President Trump is proposing taking billions of dollars from drug interdiction efforts. That is nonsensical.
.@realDonaldTrump's fake national emergency is the true threat to our national security. He is proposing taking money from our military and critical drug apprehension efforts to construct an unnecessary, medieval wall to fulfill a campaign promise.

Important discussions about how we can most effectively keep our nation safe should not be rushed under the threat of a shutdown.

Thank you @SenatorHassan! It’s time to #EndTheShutdown
“We have a growing concern for the safety and security of our members, our airlines and the traveling public due to the government shutdown,”-The unions that represent the nation’s air traffic controllers, pilots and flight attendants. #EndTheShutdown
Sorry @SecretaryRoss, most government employees aren’t worth $700 million. The #TrumpShutdown is creating real hardship for government employees in New Hampshire and across the country. #EndTheShutdown
Thank you @SenJoniErnst for bravely speaking out letting survivors know they aren't alone. Sexual domestic violence are pervasive problems that cut across all segments of our society I will continue working to prevent violence and support survivors.
Excited to get to work on @EnergyCommerce fight for NH priorities such as combating #climatechange, increasing access to affordable healthcare, tackling the opioid epidemic, expanding rural broadband standing up against efforts to undermine environmental protections.
The American people depend on @EPA to enforce regulations to protect our air, land water. In NH we’ve seen the damaging consequences of water pollution I fear failure to hold bad actors responsible will send a signal to others that they can flaunt environmental protections.
Two years ago today, the #GlobalGagRule was reinstated. This has severely impacted the ability of poor women families overseas to access critical reproductive care, putting their health potentially their lives at risk. We must end this harmful policy.
Today I will vote for the 10th time to reopen the government. I hope the Senate will follow suit so we can have a thoughtful discussion on 21st Century border security proposals. Government employees should not be held hostage by the #TrumpShutdown. #EndTheShutdown
Wonderful segment on civil rights activist Jonathan Daniels from Keene who sacrificed his own life in 1965 to save a teenage girl while fighting for equal rights in Alabama. His heroism commitment to equality should continue to serve as an example to all

Thank you Brian for your courage as you face this challenge! We are all thinking of you and wishing for the best. @iamalsorg
#TrumpShutdown is causing anxiety for some of the most vulnerable among us, including survivors of sexual violence. I spoke w/survivors advocates in NH on Friday they are afraid of survivors losing access to lifesaving services. We must #EndTheShutdown
Friday I joined @BensonAndHarf on @foxnewsradio to discuss the partial government shutdown. We need to reopen the government so that we can work towards 21st Century border security. This shutdown is jeopardizing the safety of the American people. Listen:
On this day in 1973, #RoevWade established that women have the right to make their own reproductive health decisions. Now more than ever, I am committed to protecting a woman’s right to choose. We can’t undo the progress we’ve made on reproductive rights. #Roe46.
A correctional officer member of the military wrote to me said that as a father of 4 kids, the shutdown is affecting him greatly. If he continues to not earn pay, he will not remain a Federal Employee. Today marks 1 month of #TrumpShutdown it must end now. #EndTheShutdown
Great to join @SenatorHassan, elected officials and Granite Staters yesterday at Southern NH Outreach for Black Unity’s Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast. We’ve made progress in the fight for equal rights for all, but we must keep working to help make Dr. King's dream a reality.
This is just wrong. Transgender Americans have bravely served and sacrificed for our nation. They shouldn't face discrimination and should have the opportunity to serve in the military. I’m grateful for all those who serve and I'll continue to oppose this misguided policy.
Today we remember Martin Luther King, Jr. honor his deep commitment to peace equality. We must continue to build on his incredible legacy never stop our efforts to create a better, fairer world for everyone. As Dr. King said, "The time is always right to do what is right."

I met with survivor advocates from @NHCADSV and Turning Points Crisis Center in Claremont this AM to discuss the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on efforts to address domestic and sexual violence in NH. This shutdown must end so we can affirm our commitment to supporting survivors.

Excited to join @EnergyCommerce! On the Health, Energy, and Oversight Investigations subcommittees I will fight for NH priorities such as increasing access to affordable healthcare, combating #climatechange, promoting renewables, pushing back against efforts to sabotage #ACA
Happy Birthday @MichelleObama! Thank you for your incredible service to our country and your unyielding commitment to improving our nation for all!
The #TrumpShutdown is hurting Granite Staters must end. @senatemajldr @realDonaldTrump should act on the bills we've passed to reopen the government. I'm heartened to see NH businesses stepping up to support those struggling but this shutdown must end.
I may be biased but... New Hampshire is the best! Check out these winter pics:

It’s unthinkable survivors of sexual domestic violence will be unwitting victims in @RealDonaldTrump’s ongoing shutdown. @Senatemajldr should hold a vote to reopen the government help ensure survivors have access to the support services they need.
