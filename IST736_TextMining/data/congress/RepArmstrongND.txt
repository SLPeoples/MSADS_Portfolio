Great news! North Dakota’s $32 billion oil industry is trending toward more long-term jobs and fewer temporary positions. This means more stability for the industry and all of the businesses that supply or rely on it.
North Dakota possesses the single largest deposit of lignite coal in the world. I met with folks from North American Coal today to discuss safe, reliable energy for #NorthDakota and the entire country and the family-supporting jobs the industry provides.

Thanks to Michael Olsen from Fargo along with Kristen from @mssociety for stopping by the office today and supporting #NorthDakota families affected by #MS. We must find a cure for this disease.
Spoke to heroes today. These veterans lead the #NorthDakota VFW. Our veterans put their lives on the line for our country and they deserve the best from our country in return. Above all, they deserve timely access to the benefits they’ve earned, most importantly healthcare.
Evidence of his legacy is throughout the community, from the Fargo Air Museum to the Fargo Air Sho. He will be dearly missed, but he will not be forgotten. My deepest sympathies to the Schroeder family.
Maj. Gen. Darrol Schroeder’s selfless contribution to #NorthDakota and this nation will be remembered for many years to come. His exemplary service spanned decades and included many accomplishments and milestones, including combat certification for seven different aircraft.
Just so we’re all on the same page, 1776 is the perfect number of followers. No more followers, please! #Spiritof76 ��
With this ruling and the decisive action taken by the administration to negotiate better trade deals, #NorthDakota farmers can get back to the business of growing the world’s food.
The World Trade Organization ruling is a win for #NorthDakota farmers. For years, China‘s government has manipulated the markets for its advantage – and America’s producers have suffered the negative consequences.

The reduction of carbon emissions must be a global effort that includes China India, who respectively led the world in emissions and emissions growth last yr. The U.S. can lead in reducing carbon emissions without jeopardizing our economy by focusing on technology innovation.

Rather than working with the administration to stem the flow of illegal drugs and stop human trafficking across the border, House Democrats took a political vote on legislation that has zero chance of becoming law. #116thCongress #SecureTheBorder
There is a humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border. The president took decisive action to secure the border by using authority delegated to him by Congress in case of a national emergency. #116thCongress #SecureTheBorder
I stood with my colleagues to defend the #2ndAmendment today. I’ll vote no on the gun control bill, #HR8. It’s bad policy and significantly curtails Rural America’s 2nd Amendment rights. #support2a
I don't understand why the Democrats' gun control bill (#HR8) includes exceptions for hunting, trapping and fishing, but not farming and ranching. I fought for an amendment that adds two simple words: Farming and Ranching. Unfortunately, the committee did not accept my amendment.
Agriculture is a $10 billion sector in #NorthDakota. I was glad to welcome Gov. @DougBurgum to DC today to discuss how we can grow our ag industry and support farmers and ranchers.
Thank you to @MinotDailyNews Editorial Board for letting me come in and talk about my first several weeks as North Dakota's Congressman.
This is great news and a good sign of progress in the ongoing trade negotiations. I heard from North Dakota farmers this week that this is a top priority. Thank you @SecretarySonny and @POTUS for fighting for our ag industry.
I joined 62 of my House colleagues in sending a letter of support, led by @repkevinhern, to @USDA @SecretarySonny. To read more about these changes and the full letter we sent to Sec. Perdue, check out my release here. #NorthDakota #116thCongress 5/5
The move would save up to $15 billion over ten years. That's real savings for the American people. #NorthDakota #116thCongress 4/
The proposed change would eliminate loopholes abused by states, which allow people to stay on the program without being encouraged to find meaningful employment. #NorthDakota #116thCongress 3/
Food stamps are intended to help those in need get back on their feet, back in the workforce and become self-sufficient. With the economy as strong as it is right now, we should encourage work for those able to, not discourage it. #NorthDakota #116thCongress 2/
I announced my support for much-needed food stamp reforms this week. These changes eliminate loopholes in work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents. #NorthDakota #116thCongress 1/

The fund created by the Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act is funded by existing revenues from energy projects operating on federal land. As an avid outdoorsman, I treasure our national parks and this bill is a common-sense way to address the maintenance backlog. #NorthDakota
#NorthDakota @NatlParkService sites have $52m in deferred maintenance, most of which is at @TRooseveltNPS. This is why I cosponsored the Restore Our Parks and Public Lands Act, which creates a fund to reduce deferred maintenance backlogs at national parks.
Happy Presidents' Day! Today we honor and remember the legacies of President George Washington and President Abraham Lincoln, whose birthdays are February 22 and February 12. #PresidentsDay
The bill also includes victories for ND. Rural North Dakotans, farmers and ranchers all benefit. While it’s far from perfect, the funding for the border barrier, 1200 new @CBP agents, along with the wins for the ND ag community outweigh my significant concerns with the bill.
I voted tonight to build 55 miles of new physical barriers on the southern border, in addition to $22.5 billion in other border security measures. This is an important step to secure the US-Mexico border and ending the humanitarian crisis.
Addiction doesn’t care about political affiliation and fighting the addiction crisis, especially the opioid epidemic, is a bipartisan priority. Glad to join @RepDavidTrone's Freshman Working Group on Addiction.
I'm fighting for the 2nd Amendment rights of #farmers and #ranchers. #HR8 makes felons out of thousands of North Dakotans who lend a firearm to a friend on their own land.It's clear that those pushing this bill have not spent much time in rural America.
My amendment to #HR8 includes ranching and farming along with hunting, fishing and trapping for legally lending a gun. The bill as written makes felons out of thousands of ranchers and farmers. This amendment is common-sense. I urge my colleagues to adopt it.
Today the House Judiciary Commitee will vote on #HR8, a misguided bill that makes felons out of thousands of farm and ranch kids (my statement in the hearing last week below). Follow @JudiciaryGOP to follow updates from the Committee today. #116thCongress

Today, 13 Democrats supported our motion. Yesterday, 10 supported our motion and last week, 6 supported it. We should pay federal workers while we continue to work on securing the border and fully reopen the government. (2/2)
House Republicans have repeatedly tried to give federal workers their missed paychecks. As we work towards securing the border and reopening the government, our amendment would fund the past pay periods for federal workers, allowing them to be paid right away. (1/2)

We mourn the loss of a giant in the corn industry, a longtime champion of agriculture, Dale Ihry. Dale never stopped advocating for North Dakota. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time.
This behavior and language is abhorrent and unacceptable for a Member of Congress, especially in reference to the leader of our country. @RepRashida should apologize for her foul language.
Let’s bring home the SEVENTH �,  @NDSUfootball! Go hard, play hard, we have great faith in you! #FCSChampionship #RaiseTheBar #FargoToFrisco
These moves are a mistake. I’m hopeful common-sense members across the aisle will work with me in a bipartisan fashion to help grow jobs, raise wages, and expand opportunities for North Dakota farmers, ranchers and energy workers. #116thCongress
.@SpeakerPelosi and the Democrats also made it easier to grow the #NationalDebt and avoid accountability. With procedural tricks, they can suspend the debt limit. This is wrong. The job of Congress is to take votes and answer for those votes to the people.
I’m disappointed that on the first day of the #116thCongress, @SpeakerPelosi and the Democrats made it easier to raise taxes on hard-working Americans. Their agenda is a #TaxIncrease Agenda. I’ll fight to keep taxes low for all North Dakotans.
Glad to be here! Looking forward to working with both of you to move #NorthDakota forward. #116thCongress
