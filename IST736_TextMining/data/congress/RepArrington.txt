Congrats to Coach Beard and his Red Raiders on winning the Big XII Championship! Guns up, Go West Texas!
This is reassuring news for ag producers in Texas where we produce the second largest amount of sorghum in the nation.
Great news for U.S. sorghum producers: China has made its biggest purchase of U.S. sorghum since last year. I appreciate @POTUS and @USTradeRep fighting for our farmers and for achieving real results in trade negotiations with China.
The Democrats’ #MedicareforAll proposal would cost our economy over $30 trillion, eliminate private insurance, and rip healthcare away from millions of Americans. We need robust competition, transparency, and consumer choice in healthcare, not another big-government solution.

Thank you, Mr. President, for fighting for American farmers and ranchers... and giving voice to the “forgotten man” of Rural America! We are behind you 100%!
This ruling is a big win for our ag producers and will go a long way towards leveling the playing field in China. As trade discussions with China continue, it is critical we continue to assert our rights when they don't live up to their commitments. #AmericaFirst
China has been cheating and taking advantage of us for decades. I applaud President Trump and his administration for negotiating from strength and putting American job creators, manufactures, and producers first.

By all measures, our country is facing a national security and humanitarian crisis and President Trump is doing the right thing, the responsible thing, and the constitutionally necessary thing to secure our borders and keep the American people safe. I'm behind him 100%.

Securing our borders to safeguard our sovereignty and protect the American people isn’t just good policy: it’s one of our first and most important constitutionally prescribed duties.
The first job of the federal government is the provide for the common defense, and President Trump is taking the necessary actions as Commander-in-Chief to secure the border and to keep Americans safe.

With a new Farm Bill and cotton’s restored status as a Title One commodity, West Texas cotton farmers have additional certainty and stability to contend with weather and market risks.
Cotton is the lifeblood of our region and I was honored to join Rolling Plains Cotton Growers last night ahead of their annual meeting.
With half of rural hospitals across America operating in the red and struggling to survive, it is essential we revitalize our nation’s rural healthcare system so we can ensure sustainable healthcare for families living in rural communities.
It was good to visit with leaders at Cogdell Memorial Hospital in Snyder yesterday.
Because of tax reform, BML has expanded their operations, created jobs, and improved the quality of life for West Texans.

Glad to serve at the Lubbock Lions Club's annual Pancake Festival. Nearly 6,000 pounds of pancake mix were used to support charities in our community...great to see the generous spirit of West Texans on full display!
While it’s not ideal, @POTUS has the legal authority to deal with much of this crisis by declaring a national emergency, and I am pleased he has indicated he will do so
Unfortunately, Democrats were not interested in offering credible compromise-solutions and the final agreement fell well short of the President’s comprehensive border security proposal, not even funding half of his requested amount for both infrastructure and personnel.
I have been adamant that our country is facing a national security crisis and that Congress must give the President the resources and tools he needs to secure the border and protect our citizens.

One of the best parts of my job is spending time with our nation’s future leaders. Last week I was glad to visit with students from Victory Life Church in Lubbock. It is great to see the role that faith and God is playing in the lives of young West Texans!
That is why I introduced the “No Budget, No Recess Act” to ensure that Members of Congress don’t get to skip town before passing a budget and doing the job we were hired to do.
Every American family and small business has to plan for and stick to a budget, and Congress should be no different.
Because we’ve put in place pro-growth policies, Americans are more optimistic about their personal finances than they’ve been in over 15 years, giving them the freedom to save, spend, and invest more in themselves and in their family's future.

The State of our Union is STRONG!
The President’s message was spot on:• establish a safe and legal immigration system with real border security• protect American workers in trade• rebuild America’s infrastructure• lower the cost of healthcare• protect America’s national interests abroad
"We must keep America first in our hearts; we must keep freedom alive in our souls; we must always keep faith in America's destiny - that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!" - @POTUS
AMEN!
"Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life, and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children - born and unborn - are made in the holy image of God." - @POTUS
President Trump negotiated from a position of strength, and the USMCA will provide freer and fairer trade markets with our neighbors to the north and south. #SOTU
Canada and Mexico are our second and third largest trading partners, representing 15% and 14.3 % of the US’ total trade market respectively.
"Our new USMCA will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA" - @POTUS
"Simply put, walls work and walls save lives." - @POTUS
In fact, illegal immigration costs Texas $12 billion a year, and since 2011, 186,000 illegal aliens have been charged with more than 291,000 criminal offenses in the state. #SOTU
As a border state, no one is on the frontlines of this fight more than Texas, and the federal government has been derelict in their duty to secure the border.
"The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens." - @POTUS
Our porous border has allowed for rampant criminal and gang activity to occur in our communities. We need to secure our southernmost border and BUILD THE WALL where it is appropriate. #SOTU
"Now is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business." - @POTUS
"In the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, A SWEEPING NEW FARM BILL, historic VA reforms ..." - @POTUS
"After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. The State of our Union is STRONG" - @POTUS
Great news for West Texas producers!
"We have unleashed a revolution in American energy - the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy." - @POTUS
The American people are seeing more money in their pockets thanks to the booming economy. #SOTU
Under the leadership of President Trump and Republicans in Congress, our nation’s total real gross domestic product growth exceeded 3% over the last four quarters, with it topping 4.2% in the second quarter.
"In just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom - a boom that has rarely been seen before." - @POTUS

Since Roe v. Wade, we’ve fallen short of that national ethic by not acknowledging that life at every stage is precious, valuable, sacred, and ought to be protected. I am proud to be on the Pro-Life Caucus, fighting for the rights and privileges of the unborn.
Enshrined in the Declaration of Independence is our founding principle that all are created equally by God and endowed by our Creator to have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
BUILD THE WALL!
Whether it was No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, Kate’s Law, Securing America’s Future Act, Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act, or a resolution backing the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, House Republicans received little to no support from our Democrat counterparts.
Throughout the 115th Congress, Democrats refused to come to the table to discuss meaningful immigration reform – instead, they’ve resorted to open-border, sanctuary city policies.
Their stance may have changed, but the facts haven’t. We’ve seen that where walls and fencing have been built, illegal border crossings have dropped upwards of 90%: El Paso – 95%, Yuma – 95%, San Diego – 92%, Tucson – 90%.
The fact is that walls work, and Democrats have supported border security in the past.
Our porous border costs Texas alone $12 billion a year, and since 2011, our state has charged more than 186,000 illegal aliens with more than 291,00 criminal offenses.
Border security is a national security issue, and our southernmost border needs reinforcements: a physical barrier, advanced technology, and boots on the ground.
It is clear after my meeting with President Trump that my Democrat colleagues aren’t interested in discussing the safety and security of the American people.
This week, I, along with a few members from both sides of the aisle, was invited to the White House to discuss strengthening our southernmost border. Unfortunately, no Democrats joined.
We are negotiating from strength and putting American workers, manufacturers, and producers first. This is refreshing!

3. West Texas has seen firsthand China’s cheating practices in cotton production, dumping cheap product on the market and mass subsidizing their farmers.
2. He and the President did a good job on improving NAFTA, now-USMCA, and providing certainty to our producers largest market.

RT @realDonaldTrump: President Obama, thank you for your great support – I have been saying this all along!
Then-Senator Obama: “The bill before us will certainly do some good. It will authorize some badly needed funding for better fences and better security along our borders, and that should help stem some of the tide of illegal immigration in this country.”
Senator Dianne Feinstein: “Democrats are solidly behind controlling the border, and we support the border fence. . . We’ve got to get tough on the border.”
Senator Schumer (3/3): "Any immigration solution must recognize that we must do as much as we can to gain control of our borders as soon as possible."
Senator Schumer (2/3): "The progress includes 9,000 new border patrol field agents in the last four years, construction of a 630-mile border fence, or 630 miles of border fence, that create a significant barrier to illegal immigration on a southern land border."
Senator Schumer (1/3): "Because of our efforts in Congress, our border is far more secure today than it was when we began debating comprehensive reform in 2005. Between 2005 and 2009, a vast amount of progress has been made on our borders and ports of entry."
Speaker Pelosi: “What are the options that we have available to us, let's make sure they work. Because while we need to address the issue of immigration and the challenge we have of undocumented people in our country, we certainly don’t want any more coming in.”
Border security is national security, and physical barriers like walls are a critical component. BUT don’t take my word for it, see past statements from Democrat leaders ↓

The American people deserve real solutions to affordable care.
No government plan or program can divine these desired outcomes - only a healthy market with robust competition and maximum consumer choice can achieve them.

Our economy continues to grow as a result of pro-growth policies like tax cuts and regulatory relief, proving that House Republican-led initiatives worked throughout the 115th Congress.
I will also reject out-of-hand any funding bill that does not give the President the resources he needs to secure the border and protect our citizens.
I will fight to protect our tax cuts and other free market policies that have finally put America back on a path to economic growth and prosperity.
Less government and more freedom has been the key to our recent economic success, and now the Democrats want to go backwards with more taxes, more spending, and more government control.
I am very disappointed - but not surprised - that the first action taken by Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats was a “Rules Package” that makes it easier to raise taxes, eliminate the debt-ceiling, bailout Obamacare, and reverse work requirements for Food Stamp recipients.
Great to visit with you, Chancellor!
Good article about cotton, Texas’ cash crop. Kudos to Matt Farmer and his family - he told our story
Doing these things will solve most of the problem. How about it Senate Democrats? Let’s solve the problem and not just give lip service to the American people.
- close loopholes being exploited by illegals regarding asylum, sanctuary cities, and others; and - build more detention facilities and increase the number of immigration judges to end catch and release and expedite deportation hearings.
If Democrats are truly serious about stopping illegal immigration, as Schumer and Pelosi have repeatedly stated, then they should at least support the following:- turn off all magnets - no jobs and no federal funding of any kind for illegals;
In addition to physical barriers, we must STOP rewarding people who come to this country illegally.
Washington has failed us; Trump is fighting for us!
Schumer’s current posture is disingenuous, and I believe he and the Democrats are putting politics ahead of the safety and security of our citizens. Border states like Texas have spent billions of dollars doing the federal government’s job.
The President and Republicans in the House also put forth a DACA fix along with border security, which received ZERO Democrat support.
I support President Trump and his unwavering commitment to securing the border, including funding for the wall. Senator Schumer and the Democrats voted for wall funding last year as well as 700 miles of fencing in 2006.
A year later, our economy continues to grow. By limiting the government and providing much needed relief from our outdated, burdensome tax code, we’ve unleashed the limitless potential of the American people.
Let’s support our Commander-in-Chief, let’s build the wall, and let’s do our first and most important job - keep Americans safe!
There is a time to compromise, and there is a time to stand firm and fight. Border security is about more than just Rule of Law. It’s about keeping our families and communities safe, and that is a moral imperative!
For the sake of the safety of the American people, I call on the Senate to pass a bill that includes funding for real border security.
President Trump has pleaded with Congress for the necessary resources to secure the border. Last night, the House voted to give him what he requested - $5.7 billion, enabling him to shore up our southernmost border.

Agriculture and traditional American values go hand-in-hand. Farmers and ranchers represent more than food and fiber – they symbolize a culture of faith, hard work, and independence, which has always been at the heart of America’s greatness.
... They also provide support for critical infrastructure in rural communities that support our family farmers and ranchers.
Agriculture plays a critical role in America’s prosperity and national security. Farm Bills provide the certainty that our producers desperately need in the face of tremendous weather volatility, trade inequities, and global market swings. ...
Additionally, the final bill includes two amendments I introduced to strengthen access to healthcare for rural communities and allow universities like Texas Tech to compete for more agriculture-related research funding.
