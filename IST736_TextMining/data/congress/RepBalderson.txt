Let's be clear, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is not about abortion, it's about infanticide. As its name says, it would protect the lives of children who survive abortions.Those born alive should have the right to live. I'm proud to support this legislation.

Yesterday’s bomb attack in Kashmir that resulted in the injury or death of at least 40 Indian paramilitary police officers is heinous. We must recommit ourselves to fighting terrorism in all possible ways—at home and abroad.

Today, I asked the Chief Administrative Officer to withhold my pay for the duration of the partial shutdown. It is unfair that our nation’s citizens are paying the price of political posturing. I stand with them, I hear them, and I am working for them.
Democrats want to #EndTheShutdown? There’s an easy way. It’s time to secure our borders and keep Americans safe. (3/3)
Forcing our citizens to pay the price of partisan games is shameful. For this reason, I urge my Democratic colleagues to come to the table so we can find a resolution and fully reopen our government. (2/3)
Border security is of the utmost importance in safeguarding our nation’s citizens. At the same time, this partial shutdown has gone on far too long, unfairly impacting Americans, including residents of my home district of #OH12. (1/3)
