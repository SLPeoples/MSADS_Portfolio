Glad to have worked with @RepRoybalAllard on this critically important report. We now have a framework to cut child poverty in HALF over the next decade. Let’s get to work!
It's outrageous that there are millions of children living in poverty in the richest nation on earth. But for many – especially people of color – systemic barriers keep their families trapped at the bottom. We must tackle child poverty once and for all.
In 2017, 6,004 background checks were denied after the initial 3-day waiting period. #HR1112 would allow the FBI more time to run background checks so we can stop prohibited gun owners from slipping through the cracks.  We need to close the #CharlestonLoophole #ForThePeople .
