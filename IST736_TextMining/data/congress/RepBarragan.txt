We must call out racism when we see and hear it. The photo on Governor Northam’s medical school yearbook page is disturbing and racist. I join my colleagues in the @OfficialCBC and @HispanicCaucus in calling for Governor Ralph Northam’s resignation.
Deeply saddened by the passing of Dr. Michelle King, the first black woman to serve as Superintendent of Schools at @LASchools. As a lifelong educator, she lived her life in service of others. May her legacy live on and may she rest in peace.
When I think about the border, I think of hope — the kind that my parents had when they decided to immigrate to the the United States. Despite this administration’s unwelcoming response to migrants, there is still and will always be hope.

10 years ago today, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was signed into law. Although we’ve made great strides, the gender wage gap still persists. Pay discrimination continues to harm women and families. We must keep up the fight and use our strong voice to achieve #EqualPay.

Already, migrants are in shelters where capacity is stretched to the breaking point forced to sleep on the street where they are vulnerable to the violence they had hoped to leave behind in their home countries. This policy will only make matters worse.
Sat down with US Coast Guard service members and personnel at Base LA/LB to hear heartbreaking stories of how the shutdown impacts them, their families and the mission. As part of our military and nat’l security operation, we must work so they never go another day without pay.
After 35 days of suffering two missed paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, the president has finally decided to re-open the government he proudly shutdown. Now, let’s keep it open, pay our civil servants have honest negotiations on border security. #NoWall
