Congressman Ben Cline Announces 2019 Congressional Art Competition #va06
Bedford County Sheriff Mike Brown has dedicated nearly a quarter-century of service to protecting the county’s citizens. I took to the House floor today to thank him for a job well done and wish him well in retirement. #va06
The Notify ICE Act is an important piece of legislation designed to protect Americans. If an illegal immigrant fails a background check due to their status, that information should be reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Watch this report from @WHSVnews. #va06
I thank @WDBJ7 for covering last Friday’s Read Across America Day at Central Elementary. I enjoyed returning to my former school and teaching our region’s young people about Congress. #va06
An estimated 20 vets a day die by suicide. That is unacceptable. I am hopeful the executive order on veterans suicide prevention signed today by @realDonaldTrump will bring the full power of the federal government to reduce and end this national tragedy.
I met with a group of bright students today at Spotswood High School. They asked thoughtful questions about my work in Congress and the direction of our country. #va06
Thanks for noticing, Roger - this is just the first of many ‘kerfluffles’ I plan to cause.

Don’t forget – tomorrow is the first Service Academy Day of 2019. Come to Heritage High School in Lynchburg on Saturday between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. to get information on attending one of America’s five service academies.
I spoke with @trish_regan last night about @realDonaldTrump’s recent summit with the North Korean leader. Just like President Reagan with Gorbachev, President Trump showed strength by walking away from a bad deal.
I thank Central Elementary for inviting me to read to students on Read Across America Day. I was delighted to return to my former elementary school and meet with students full of big dreams. #va06
Getting ready to talk to @trish_regan on @FoxBusiness about @realDonaldTrump’s meeting with Kim Jong-un.
Today, I welcomed Shenandoah Valley Adventist Elementary students to the United States Capitol. They are a wonderful group of students who represent #va06 well!
Rep. @SteveScalise is a co-sponsor of the Notify ICE Act, which I introduced yesterday with 14 other co-sponsors.
Notify ICE Act Introduced by Rep. Ben Cline #va06 @JudiciaryGOP
Gun control measures like #HR8 do not address the problems of gun violence and the only thing this bill does is limit the #2ndAmendment rights of law-abiding citizens.
We can’t afford it. That’s the message I brought to Congress last night, joining @RepAndyBiggsAZ and several of my House colleagues urging a return to regular order and addressing the federal government’s fiscal crisis, which threatens our economic and national security. #va06
I was disappointed the Rules Committee failed to adopt my amendment to #HR8 which would notify ICE when an illegal immigrant applies to purchase a gun. This shows that this bill is not about protecting Americans, but instead is about taking rights away from law abiding citizens.
During a visit to @DaVita Kidney Care in Harrisonburg this morning, I met with patients and healthcare professionals about how to improve access to care. #va06

The VA Medical Center in Salem provides care to many #va06 veterans. This year marks 85 years since President Franklin Roosevelt commissioned this facility. I am pleased to see this VA-rated Five Star Facility still serving the men and women who served their country in uniform.
I thank the citizens of Lynchburg for attending tonight’s town hall. I will take your views and concerns with me to Washington. Thanks again! #va06
During today’s visit to @centra, we discussed the care provided by the health system, including the new Fifth Street Community Health Center, a facility providing free health care to those in need in downtown Lynchburg. I thank CEO Michael Elliott for the informative visit. #va06
Today, Virginia remembers the first of many presidents to call the Commonwealth home. George Washington was a hero during the American Revolution. As our first president, he set an example of true leadership for the 44 other presidents who have followed. #va06

All stories deserve to be heard. Congressman @SteveScalise’s story is one of courage in the face of pure evil. It is absurd that Democrats blocked his testimony on the 2nd Amendment yesterday.
