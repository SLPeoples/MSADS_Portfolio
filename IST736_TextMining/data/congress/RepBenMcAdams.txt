We must have serious bipartisan conversations about the debt. It is clear our country is on a dangerous and unsustainable course. The decisions won’t be easy, but our children and our grandchildren are counting on us to make this right. @HouseBudgetDems #utpol
I support results-driven policy agenda and ensuring scarce federal resources are invested in what works; more wisely using tax dollars and improving outcomes for young people, their families, and communities. @HouseBudgetDems #utpol
I support @repjimcooper's #NoBudgetNoPay legislation. Everyone in this country understands that if you don’t do your job, you won’t get paid. The same rules should apply to Congress. If we don’t pass a budget and funding bills, Congress shouldn't get paid. @HouseBudgetDems #utpol
By generally prohibiting the federal govt from spending more than it receives in a fiscal year, we can start to fix the debt problem. I will work with Congress to advance a #BalancedBudgetAmendment, championed in the past by the @HouseBlueDogs. @HouseBudgetDems #utpol
@HouseBlueDogs Task Force on Fiscal Responsibility Govt Reform will be responsible for crafting policies that increase transparency, hold Congress accountable to the taxpayers and ensure that money is spent wisely. #utpol @HouseBudgetDems

It is critical, in our first in our first votes in the House on the rules package, that we kept pay-as-you-go. Every Utah family understands that when you decide to make a purchase, you must first show how you’ll pay for it. #utpol @HouseBudgetDems
The national debt is fiscally irresponsible and morally reprehensive to saddle generations yet unborn with these bills. @HouseBudgetDems #utpol
The interest on our debt is now the fastest growing part of the federal budget. Next year, we will spend more on interest than all the federal funding for our kids. By the year 2025, our interest payments will exceed the cost of our defense budget. @HouseBudgetDems #utpol
Our $22 trillion debt is a bipartisan problem. Both parties got us into this mess. Both Democrats and Republicans have acted in a way that suggests debt doesn't matter. But I'm here to say - it DOES matter. @HouseBudgetDems #utpol

@bonuslife @ObesityAction @Eggface @asmbs @ZaherToumi Thank you for coming by!
@darinbushman That’s my point. Both sides reached a bipartisan deal. Neither side loved it. That’s compromise. If the President, R or D, can do whatever they want when Congress doesn’t agree with them, then that is a dangerous precedent and undermines our constitutional balance of powers.
I support the resolution to block the President from spending almost $8 billion w/out approval from Congress. Our Constitution separates powers to ensure a democratic process. The President's action sets a dangerous precedent harms our constitutional checks and balances. #utpol

@darinhorrocks No. If a budget is not passed on time, the bill makes it so the govt will continue operating under an automatic concurrent resolution. It will also stop all congressional salaries and travel funding, and prohibits some White House and cabinet member funding during that time.
@SlateandStylish @NFBUtah I’m glad I beat out that stiff competition! No matter what they say about me, I will always know that at least I’m better than a case of bronchitis and a trip to the hospital. � Get well soon. We missed you.
