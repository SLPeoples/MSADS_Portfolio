Yesterday, I paid special tribute to the life of Jack Restivo of Bryan. Jack’s life was defined by his service to his family, to our country, to Texas University and to our Central Texas community.
Today, I paid special tribute to the life of Dr. Francis Graham of Waco. Frank’s life was defined by his service to his family, to our country to our community. He will be forever remembered as a husband, a father, a grandfather, a veteran, a selfless servant a great friend.
Today, I voted against H.R. 1. This bill is a deliberate attempt by the House Democratic Majority to suppress First Amendment rights, spend taxpayer dollars and empower Washington bureaucrats – all under the guise of election reform. 
In just a few minutes, I will be speaking on the House floor to recognize and honor members our community. I invite you to tune in and watch these special recognitions on

I applaud and support @POTUS's actions to prevent and reduce veteran suicide. It is our duty as Americans to help our nation’s heroes, who have sacrificed much for our country.
