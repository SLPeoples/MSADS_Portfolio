#IWD2019 is a chance to pause and remember the innumerable contributions women have made. Today and every day, we honor their sacrifices that helped pave the way toward equality and a better world for everyone. #InternationalWomensDay
I was proud to vote for #HR1 that will restore the fundamental principles of our democracy and return to a government by the people, for the people. #ForThePeople.
During #WomensHistoryMonth, I salute the amazing women who have led the way in the fight for gender equality. It’s time we make sure women everywhere reach their full potential and that they live in a world free of discrimination. #HERStory @HouseDemWomen
I was proud to join @PPFA and my colleagues in Chicago this morning to take a stand against @realDonaldTrump's attempt to restrict women’s health care access. #nogagrule
I'm proud to introduce a resolution this week with @RepUnderwood, @SenatorDurbin, and @SenDuckworth honoring the victims and police officers who were injured in the shooting at Henry Pratt Plant. #AuroraStrong
I was proud to vote for commonsense legislation to #EndGunViolence this week in Washington. Nearly 40,000 Americans lose their lives each year because of gun violence. Enough is enough. #HR8 and #HR1112 are good first steps to improving our background check system.
RT @RepDean: Today the House makes history. We will hold a vote on #HR8, a bipartisan bill to expand background checks help save lives. M…
I will vote to block @realDonaldTrump’s national emergency tonight. His declaration is an egregious abuse of presidential power. There is no national security emergency on our southern border and no need for a wasteful border wall. #FakeEmergency
More than 50 years after passage of the Voting Rights Act, racial discrimination still persists when Americans go to vote. We must come together and finally #RestoreTheVote. Congress has the power to restore essential protections so our democracy works for everyone.
ICYMI: I led Congress in a moment of silence last night to honor the victims of the shooting at the Henry Pratt Plant in Aurora. We stand united in our grief as we remember the victims and the family members they left too soon. #AuroraStrong
Today, I led Congress in a moment of silence to honor the victims of the tragic shooting at the Henry Pratt Plant. Five employees were taken from their friends and families too soon. We stand united in our grief as we remember them.  #AuroraStrong 
RT @RepLucyMcBath: The pain of losing a child to gun violence never goes away. I know – it's that pain which drives me every day in my work…
Today marks one week since we lost five people to gun violence at the Henry Pratt plant in Aurora. There's more Congress can do to prevent these senseless tragedies.
Every patient deserves to know what health care options are available. The Trump Administration’s gag rule would block doctors from giving their patients ethical, quality care. #NoGagRule
Our community endured unspeakable tragedy last week. It was heartening to see so many people come out this weekend to honor the victims and the families they left too soon. #AuroraStrong
Join us this Thursday in Oswego for a community discussion of how our communities have been affected by the heroin and opioid epidemic over the past year.

My office is aware of the situation and is monitoring it closely. Thank you to all of the first responders who are on the scene right now.
The #FakeTrumpEmergency is a gross and egregious abuse of presidential power that circumvents Congressional authority and sets a dangerous precedent for our democracy. Let's be clear: there is no national security emergency on our southern border.
Join us at @BenU1887 for a discussion of the importance of #VAWA and the resources and grants available to colleges and universities to provide professional training for staff and support services for students who are victims of sexual assault.
All attraction begins at the atomic level so #ValentinesDay is perfect timing for @ENERGY to announce $12 million for new research on Quantum Information Science for particle physics.
RT @RepTedDeutch: Standing today and always with the community of Parkland and the families of the victims of the MSD shooting as we honor…
Thank you, Opportunity. You opened our eyes to the Red Planet and proved to be a true lean-mean-out-of-this-world science machine. #ThanksOppy
Science and scientific research benefit immensely when everyone has a seat at the table or a place in a laboratory. It’s past time to change these numbers and give everyone the opportunity to achieve great things without discrimination or prejudice. #WomenInScience
Congratulations to Naperville North High School! #NSB2019
.@JohnDingell’s commitment to public service made our country a better place. His work has helped millions of Americans get the health care they need. We will remember him as a fearless legislator whose life and legacy will be impossible to forget.
I commend @GovPritzker and @KwameRaoul for their leadership on this important issue. The public health of the Willowbrook community should remain our top priority.
Today, @RepTedDeutch and I introduced legislation to make sure immigrants held in detention centers are given information about their legal rights.
The science continues to show that #climatechange is real. A new study by @NASA and @NOAA found that global surface temperatures in 2018 were the fourth warmest since 1880.
I am currently reviewing the new data from the air quality emissions tests. The public health of Illinois residents should remain our top priority. @EPA was established to protect the well-being of Americans, and I hope it will continue to honor that mission as we move forward.
Congress is finally getting its kicks and voting to honor #Route66 today. I’m proud to support legislation to establish a commission that will honor its history and legacy.
It's time for @realDonaldTrump to accept the world in which we live not the world in which his political base would like to live. It's time to stop using falsehoods to undermine policies that made our country great work to strengthen our future. #SOTU
It’s great to welcome Marilyn Weisner to the #SOTU this evening. Her work at the Aurora Food Pantry has helped hardworking families in our district put healthy food on the table. #StateOfTheUnion
106 years ago today, Rosa Parks was born. We honor her courage that forever changed the course of history. #BlackHistoryMonth
I am proud to announce that Marilyn Weisner, Executive Director of @aurorapantry will be my guest for the #SOTU address.
I’m proud to join the House #Census Caucus and work with my colleagues to provide people with a better understanding of the important role the Census plays and to protect its integrity.
I’m excited to continue my work with @HouseNewDems, @RepChrisPappas, @RepHaleyStevens, and @RepLBR  to understand the way automation and technology are changing the way we work. We need fact-based policies so that the American dream remains accessible to everyone. #FutureofWork
Ten years after President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act, women are still battling the #wagegap. It's past time for the #PaycheckFairness Act. #Ledbetter10
Again, please talk to a scientist.
This would never happen at @Fermilab. �
I am relieved that we have finally found a temporary solution to reopen the government. The #TrumpShutdown was useless and accomplished nothing except provoking economic hardship, anxiety, and uncertainty in the lives of hardworking Americans.
The #DoomsdayClock remains two minutes to midnight. We all agree that nuclear deterrence is essential for our national security. It is vital that @realDonaldTrump engage with experts who have the technical knowledge to reduce the threat of these powerful weapons.
On the anniversary of #RoevWade, I'm proud to stand with Americans who support a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. A majority of Americans agree that reproductive rights are human rights. #7in10forRoe
Transgender service members serve in our military with honor and risk their lives for our country’s national security every day. They deserve nothing less than respect and support.
Today, we recommit ourselves to the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and follow his example of service to our communities and commitment to equality justice for every person. #MLKDay
Anyone who purchased a copy of _The Art of the Deal_ should receive a refund. This offer is dead on arrival. Let us know when there’s a plan that doesn’t waste taxpayer money on fabrications for political gain. #TrumpShutDown
I’m in Chicago this morning to listen to federal workers about how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting their families. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown.
I’m proud to announce my support for H.R. 1. It’s time to make our democracy work for all Americans and end political corruption. #ForThePeople
I’m in good company this Congress as we welcome more scientists to the #116thCongress. More technical backgrounds will help us tackle important issues like #climatechange and energy innovation. It’s time for Congress to get #backtoscience.
It was great to join my colleagues in the @ProChoiceCaucus and @DrLeanaWen to recommit ourselves to the fight for #healthcare for all women. #NoGagRule
The #TrumpShutdown is now the longest shutdown in history and has hurt federal employees and hardworking families. @realDonaldTrump’s stunt has gone on long enough.
20 days into the #TrumpShutdown, we are starting to see the effects of @realdonaldtrump's reckless leadership. Federal workers will not receive a paycheck tomorrow. Crucial services like airline and food safety inspections will be impacted. It's time to #EndtheShutdown.
As a scientist, I look for facts when I make policy decisions. I didn’t see or hear any tonight to justify this wasteful idea. #TrumpAddress
97% of Americans support passing commonsense background check laws – and yet these bipartisan measures have been held up in Congress for years. Thankful to see the introduction of #HR8 today. #NeverAgain
I will donate my congressional pay to @ILfoodbank during this reckless and unnecessary #TrumpShutdown that is hurting hardworking families across the country.
As the #116thCongress gets underway, here’s a look back at some highlights of the work my offices in DC and Illinois accomplished for the people of #IL11 over the past two years.
The #TrumpShutdown has gone on far too long. @HouseDemocrats passed legislation last night to reopen the government. Now it’s time for @realDonaldTrump to do his job and end this #shutdown.
I am excited to get to work in the #116thCongress. The American people deserve a Congress that puts their priorities ahead of special interests, invests in scientific research and embraces facts, and takes its oversight responsibility seriously.
I was proud to vote for @NancyPelosi for Speaker of the House. It’s time for the new Congress to get back to fact-based policy to help all Americans. #116thCongress
ICYMI: the #TrumpShutdown could adversely affect scientific research. Innovation discovery require sustained federal funding. When @realDonaldTrump fails to lead, we risk losing new medical treatments new technology that could fight
I am deeply saddened to learn that Mayor Tom Weisner passed away. Mayor Weisner led Aurora through a period of great change and growth, leaving it a more vibrant place to live, work, and play. My thoughts are with his family during this difficult time.
Happy #Kwanzaa to all in Illinois and around the world who are celebrating.
Best of luck to Santa tonight as he and his reindeer defy the physics of the space-time continuum. Thank you to everyone at @NoradSanta for the updates! #MerryChristmas to all who are celebrating!
I introduced a bill to close the Congressional gym during a government shutdown. @SpeakerRyan continues to use it during the #TrumpShutdown as federal workers face uncertainty over the holidays. The only task we have right now is ending the #TrumpShutdown.
The #TrumpShutdown is unnecessary. I am ready to support an agreement that funds the government and does not waste resources on a border wall.
RT @FSCDems: #RELEASE: Committee #Democrats Stand Up for #DACA Recipients Seeking Access to #HomeownershipREAD: h…
I am proud to announce that @UofStFrancis will receive a major @NSF grant to support local students pursuing #STEM degrees.
I opposed this bill because any funding for a border wall is a waste of resources that are better spent on other priorities like education and infrastructure. Tonight, we saw @HouseGOP bring us closer to an unnecessary shutdown.
I’m proud to support the #FirstStepAct to begin reforming our criminal justice system.
Any funding for a border wall is a colossal waste of resources. That’s money we could use to fund new infrastructure projects and new schools. We all agree we need to fix our broken immigration system but threatening to shut down the government isn’t the way to get things done.
Millions of Americans have access to life-saving health insurance thanks to the #ACA. Republicans should stop their attacks on health care and work to make it stronger.
Tomorrow is the deadline to sign up for health insurance through the  marketplace. Don't miss your chance to #GetCovered!
Six years ago today, 20 children and 6 adults were shot and killed at #SandyHook. The best way to honor the victims of senseless gun violence is to take action and pass reforms that will make our communities safer. Thoughts and prayers are not enough.
This week, I introduced common-sense legislation to allow patients to access their medical records for free up to once a year, removing an unreasonable financial barrier to health care.
I am proud to join with my colleagues @RepChuck, @repbenraylujan, and @RepLeeZeldin to support the vital work of the men and women at our nation’s national labs.
Today, I announce my support for @NancyPelosi as Speaker of the House for the 116th Congress. She has signaled her commitment to transfer her knowledge to the next generation of leaders so that they may effectively lead the Party into a new era.
We know #climatechange is real and largely man made. The #ParisAgreement was a landmark agreement to reduce carbon emissions and limit global warming. We must commit to protect our planet for future generations.
Open Enrollment is only 5 more days – until December 15. Don’t miss your chance to #GetCovered on for 2019!
Today, we pause to remember the sacrifice and bravery of the men and women who defended our country at Pearl Harbor. #PearlHarborDay
Thank you to everyone who attended our discussion on mental health and the impact of social media last night in #Naperville.
From Abraham Lincoln to Jane Addams, Enrico Fermi to @BarackObama, the impact of Illinoisans on the great story of America is undeniable. I am proud to join in celebrating 200 years of our history as a state. #illinois200
I was honored to join students competing in @ENERGY’s annual Cyber Defense Competition this weekend at @argonne. The event brings together teams from across the country and is a great example of how we can inspire the next generation of #STEM leaders.
Wishing a #HappyHanukkah full of family and happiness to everyone celebrating the Festival of Lights.
Our thoughts are with the Bush family as we mourn the passing of George H.W. Bush. President Bush gave decades of service to our nation - from Naval pilot to Commander-in-Chief. America is a better country because of his service leadership. #Bush41
Whether @realdonaldtrump wants to believe the #NCA4 or not, #ClimateChange is real, it’s largely man made, and failing to #ActOnClimate endangers the prosperity of future generations of Americans.
Today, I introduced legislation with @SenDuckworth, @SenatorDurbin, @RepLipinski, and @RepSchneider to help @EPA communicate effectively and efficiently about the public health risks of chemicals like ethylene oxide.
A new report by @CDCgov is a sobering look at how drug overdoses and suicides are negatively impacting U.S. life expectancy. We have a lot of work to do if we are going to reverse these trends and prevent unnecessary deaths. #opioidepidemic
Tune in now to see the #MarsLanding!
We have known that climate change is real and largely man made. If @realDonaldTrump fails to act, he abdicates his responsibility to ensure prosperity for future generations. It’s time to listen to scientists, Mr. President.
Talk to a scientist

Helpful bacteria, lactic acid, hydrogen atoms, and osmosis – also known as a scientist’s recipe for making pickles delicious. #NationalPickleDay
It was an honor spending time with Vietnam #veterans this weekend in Naperville. We owe so much to those who’ve served and sacrificed for our freedom.
On #VeteransDay, we show gratitude to our veterans for everything they have sacrificed in defense of our freedom.
As our economy becomes increasingly STEM-based, it has never been more important to increase opportunities for #STEM education and training. #NationalSTEMDay
The #IranNuclearDeal was a success. Because of this deal, Iran removed much of its nuclear material and rendered the core of its heavy water nuclear reactor inoperable.@realDonaldTrump’s decision shows his diplomatic incompetence. You don’t need a PhD in physics to see that.
Open enrollment in starts today!  Make sure you #GetCovered.
Open enrollment for the marketplace starts tomorrow! From November 1 through December 15 you can compare health insurance options for 2019 and choose the plan that’s right for you. Don’t miss your chance to #GetCovered.
This announcement is another example of the President's attempt to walk away from the principles that made this country great and to instill fear in the immigrant community and the individuals who lawfully seek asylum in our country.
Tonight, we are thinking of the victims and their family and friends. We grieve with them and hope that this country can find a path to healing.
We should ask for more than thoughts prayers. We ought to ask for leaders who don’t use racist rhetoric and who condemn any act of violence against people for who they worship, what they look like, or who they love. Can the American people have that leader @realDonaldTrump?
Tomorrow is #TakeBackDay! Follow the link below for more information on where you can drop off unused medications. ��
This decision would be antithetical to American values. For centuries, the United States has stood as a beacon of hope for all those who seek safety from oppression and a better life for themselves and their children. History will not look kindly on this decision.
We refuse to allow these attempted attacks on public officials and journalists to instill fear among us and stoke political divides. We are grateful to the first-responders who put their lives at risk to keep us safe.
.⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩: do not use the word “science” to justify your Administration’s bigotry. Everyone deserves respect regardless of who they love or what gender they identify as. If you want policies based on science, try action on #climatechange.
This type of dangerous rhetoric has become the norm for @realDonaldTrump, but it’s important to take a stand against it. Promoting violence against journalists is malicious and stands against American values.
I’ve joined over 150 of my colleagues in demanding @BetsyDeVosED provide answers about why @usedgov has failed to implement the Public Student Loan Forgiveness program that Congress authorized. Our public servants deserve better.
I am honored to receive a 100 on @HRC’s Congressional Scorecard for my support of #LGBTQ equality. No one should be discriminated against because of who they are or who they love. #HRCScorecard
Yesterday, I joined @advocatehealth as they announced a new initiative to provide free naloxone kits to patients treated for opioid addiction or overdose. This is a proactive way to confront the #opioidepidemic, and it will save lives.
ICYMI: @realDonaldTrump claimed on @60Minutes that scientists have a political agenda. It was an unfortunate example of his inability to understand the importance of science and how scientific research can make our world a better
I had a great visit to a local Will County farm today and learned more about the machinery farmers use to do their work. #NationalFarmersDay
It’s #HispanicHeritageMonth! #Latinos have a significant, positive impact on our culture economy in Illinois and our nation. Read more about their contributions here:
I’ve called on @GovRauner to address the damage the Republican tax plan will have on #Illinois taxpayers.
Thank you to everyone who attended our #STEM fair at @JolietJrCollege on Saturday – including a slithery friend from @brookfield_zoo!
More evidence that it’s past time to take science and climate change seriously. If we don’t take action soon, our planet and the well-being of vulnerable populations will be at risk. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to get #backtoscience.
Leon Lederman was a brilliant physicist whose love of scientific discovery was inspirational to so many and whose work transformed our understanding of the world around us.
Proud that @usedgov has named Naperville North HS a @NatlBlueRibbon school! This is a testament to the hard work of teachers, administrators, students, and parents who make education a priority in @Naperville203 our community. #nbrs2018
The United States has stood as a leader for human rights, because our policies have reflected openness and acceptance. This decision turns back the clock on progress and is a disgrace. The global #LGBTQ community deserves nothing short of equality.
Congrats to Arthur Ashkin, Gerard Mourou, and especially to Donna Strickland for winning the Nobel Prize in physics.  We need to do more to encourage and celebrate #WomeninSTEM so that it’s not 55 years until the next woman wins a #NobelPrize.
Join us this Saturday at @JolietJrCollege for an interactive #STEM fair featuring local organizations including @brookfield_zoo!
Happy Birthday! For sixty years, @NASA has inspired explorers, young scientists, and our imaginations to understand the world beyond our own planet. #NASA60th
ICYMI: Important news out last week regarding @realDonaldTrump’s accountability to our country as President. No one is above the rule of law.
I had the honor of speaking at the @letscispeak premiere last week. It underscores the important work that scientists do and why we need them and their research now more than ever. #letsciencespeak
I’ve joined @SenatorDurbin and @SenDuckworth to ask @EPA and Sterigenics to immediately conduct testing air quality in Willowbrook to detect emissions of ethylene oxide and make the data public.
Proud to join @SteveKnight25 in announcing our bipartisan legislation – the Better Energy Storage Technology (BEST) Act – was signed into law last week.
Join us on Saturday in #Naperville for a discussion on the link between mental health disorders and substance use, as well as how effective mental health treatment can help prevent people from turning to drugs or alcohol.
Great news!
.@realDonaldTrump have you no shame? Your immigration policies - your Muslim Ban, your reduction of the number of refugees allowed in the United States, and your family separations - are nothing more than a degradation of our country’s values.
My district offices in Aurora and Joliet are seeking interns for the fall and winter terms.
I am proud to see @northcentralcol has joined the #YouAreWelcomeHere scholarship program. Its commitment to international students makes our community stronger. We all thrive when we welcome diversity.
G’mar Chatima Tova to all observing Yom Kippur tonight and tomorrow in Illinois and around the world.
I stand with my colleagues in Congress - the Senate should postpone the #Kavanaugh vote until there is a thorough investigation into the sexual assault allegations.
As technology becomes more important in our lives, lawmakers need the Office of Technology Assessment to make the best decisions for all Americans. It’s time to bring back the OTA so we can prepare for future challenges.
#DoddFrank made our nation’s economy stronger and gave Americans confidence in a system that is safer, more accountable, and more transparent. Democrats remain committed to fighting to protect American consumers and ensure our economy works for everyone. #10yearsafter
As a scientist, I can tell you it’s impossible to make facts disappear simply by outright denial. It’s past time for you to show leadership to our country and - perhaps - a little bit of human decency for your fellow Americans.
.@realDonaldTrump’s assault on the environment continues. Gutting @EPA’s methane rules will make it easier for oil and gas companies to pollute the air we breathe.
Tune in now to hear more about what policymakers can do to advance #Alzheimers research. #AtlanticStateofCare
It’s been 17 years since that fateful day that changed our nation  forever. It is vital that we #neverforget the lives we lost on  #September11th – or the bravery and sacrifice of first responders who  ran into harm’s way to help the victims.
Thank you to everyone who joined us in #Naperville on Saturday to learn about pursuing a nomination to one of America's service academies.
Shana tova to everyone celebrating tonight!
This is despicable. Subjecting families seeking lawful asylum to separation and detention for long periods of time is inhumane. We are a stronger country when we respect the basic human rights and dignity of every person. #JusticeForAll
Today, Republicans are in court to strike down protections for people with pre-existing conditions. I stand with my colleagues today to fight against any attempt to destroy protections the ACA guarantees. #ProtectOurCare
Federal employees perform vital work for our country’s national security; they respond to natural disasters; and, they conduct important research to make sure our country remains a leader in technology and science. This decision is unacceptable and destructive.
If you are a high school student interested in pursuing an education at one of America’s service academies, join us for Service Academy Day on Saturday, September 8 in Naperville.
Nearly 3,000 fellow Americans died in #PuertoRico. @realDonaldTrump’s response to Hurricane Maria was an abject failure.
Arming teachers will only further endanger students and educators. That’s why I’m joining @HouseDemocrats to demand that @BetsyDeVosED prohibit the use of federal education money to buy firearms. #buybooksnotguns
Senator McCain served his country honorably and devoted his life to public service. Thank you, Senator, for showing us how to lead with honor and integrity to the very end.
We all agree a nuclear North Korea is a threat to our national security. @realDonaldTrump needs to listen to diplomats and scientists who have the technical qualifications to advise him on the deeply complicated denuclearization process.
Wishing everyone who celebrates a joyous Eid! #EidMubarak
Once again, @realDonaldTrump has placed special interests ahead of the health and safety of our children and the future of our planet. Ending the Clean Power Plan will have serious public health consequences.
Let’s be honest. This idea was always terrible and a waste of taxpayer dollars. Our men and women in uniform work already hard to protect our country. Let’s use our resources wisely commit our military to real threats to our national security - not ridiculous displays of power.
Yesterday, I had a chance to tour the @MortonArboretum in Lisle and meet with their great staff. #IL11
On the one year anniversary of #Charlottesville, we continue to fight against racism, bigotry, and hatred. White supremacy is not welcome in this country. We must work together to ensure equality and freedom for all - despite the presence of some individuals who argue otherwise.
It was great to join #NationalNightOut events in Aurora and Joliet yesterday in support of strong partnerships between police and the communities they serve. #IL11
Join us Thursday in Warrenville for a community discussion on the importance of apprenticeship and training programs for America’s future economy. #IL11
53 years ago today, President Johnson signed the #VotingRightsAct into law – a momentous step forward for equality and a more representative democracy. We still have a lot of work to do to make sure every American can exercise their fundamental right to vote.
Join us tomorrow in Aurora for a discussion on recent policies the Trump administration implemented that are instilling fear in immigrant communities. #IL11
Thank you for having me!
It’s impossible to overstate the importance of #TitleX. @SecAzar should protect this program and keep access to health care open and accessible.
We need people in Congress with technical knowledge to tackle the issues of the future.

Today, I called on @HHSGov to re-open a database of up-to-date, evidence-based guidelines on how best to diagnose, treat, and prevent over 1,000 medical conditions or diseases.
Proud to stand with @AFGENational and all federal workers everywhere to tell @realDonaldTrump to stop undermining workers’ rights.
Today, I introduced legislation that will better equip the federal government to make well-informed decisions that help grow our economy, promote innovation, and create a better world for hardworking Americans.
We have until July 31 to tell @HHSGov that the gag rule is dangerous. Click here to make your voice heard #NoGagRule
Proud to stand with @janschakowsky, @RepLoisFrankel, and @rosadelauro to tell @HHSGov that the gag rule will have dangerous consequences for health care services. #NoGagRule
Our national parks and public lands make America unique. The idea that these beautiful areas belong to everyone - not just the rich - has preserved them for generations. We must protect them from leaders who see profit from their destruction.
ICYMI: We need better health care in this country for hardworking Americans. Check out my op-ed in the ⁦@Joliet_HN⁩. 
49 years ago today, #Apollo11 landed on the Moon, and America showed that #science can conquer even the greatest frontiers. Check out @NASA’s archived photos and videos from the historic mission.
We must stand up for our democracy and freedom even if some of our leaders will not.
Proud to attend the @scicoalition’s All-Star reception last night. I have the hand-eye coordination you expect of a physicist, so it’s a true honor to have a personalized @wheaties box. Thank you to all the scientists and people who love science for their support of our field.
Republicans need to stop these senseless political stunts and bring commonsense immigration legislation to the House Floor.
A sad day for the United States and our democracy. We will not tolerate meddling in our elections. @realDonaldTrump should understand that the interests of the American people and our country should be his only priority.
We are an information society with a Congress that understands very little about the technology we use everyday. That’s why I’ve worked with @RepMarkTakano to bring back the Office of Technology Assessment.
It's worth repeating again and again: seventy percent of Americans support #RoeVWade. They don’t want @realDonaldTrump and Brett Kavanaugh’s extreme, anti-choice agenda. We must #StopKavanaugh. #WhatsAtStake
We will have to #StopKavanaugh to protect women's rights. #RoevWade guarantees women’s essential rights – to privacy, to health care, to freedom, to choose. We cannot turn back the clock on progress. #WhatsAtStake
Today, I joined @RepMikeQuigley and @janschakowsky at @UCSUSA to discuss nuclear weapons and the need for @realDonaldTrump to take qualified scientific advice seriously during his negotiations with North Korea.
We will continue to advocate for these young people who deserve to be reunited with their parents as soon as possible. #FamiliesBelongTogether
Our country is a nation of immigrants, and we are stronger because of their dedication and commitment to our national security. These men and women deserve our highest respect - this report is despicable.
.@EPAScottPruitt’s resignation is long overdue. He deliberately reversed years of environmental regulations and climate change research, and he wildly misused taxpayer money for wasteful purchases. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to nominate someone who supports science.
Happy #IndependenceDay! Check out @NASA for interesting facts about our country’s mission in space.#IndependenceDay2018
On the 54th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, we remain as committed as ever to the fight for equality, justice, and freedom for all.
We all agree a nuclear North Korea is a threat to our national security. That’s why @realDonaldTrump should take the time and listen to qualified scientific advisors who understand the challenges of this process. North Korea cannot and will not denuclearize after one meeting.
A free press is the foundation of our country’s democracy - this means freedom to express ideas without persecution or harm. We honor the memory of the individuals we lost today with a recommitment to the freedom of all people to go to work or school without fear of violence.
I am proud to announce that @UofStFrancis will receive over $950,000 from the @NSF to provide scholarships for undergraduate #STEM majors who are pursuing teaching careers. #IL11
Simply put, House Republican leaders wasted our time with a failed #immigration bill that provided no real solutions to the immigration crisis.
I am deeply concerned that the Supreme Court’s #Janus decision will weaken our strong labor unions that have given our workers a safer work environment, fair wages, and collective bargaining rights against unfair working conditions.
Today is the third anniversary of the #SCOTUS decision that legalized marriage equality, but we need to do more. The Equality Act will extend equal protections to #LGBTQ community. It’s time to end the discrimination that is still legal in 30 states. #EqualityForward #LoveWins
Women deserve affordable and accessible health care. This includes access to facts that are clear and answers to their questions without bias. #EndTheLies
It’s a sad day for our country when our legal system condones bigotry and xenophobia. I will continue to hold this administration accountable for their actions. #NoMuslimBanEver
.@realDonaldTrump’s cruel policy separated children from their parents without a plan for reunification. Even worse, they deported some moms and dads before they were able to recover their children. We must #KeepFamiliesTogether!
Voting is a right, not a privilege. Five years after the Supreme Court gutted the VRA, Americans want the full freedom to vote back. It’s time to #RestoreTheVOTE.
All of the great images from #CephalopodWeek are a reminder of the diverse creatures that live in the oceans and the need to protect them for future generations. (Maybe every week should be #CephalopodWeek)
