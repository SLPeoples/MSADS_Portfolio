I encourage @POTUS to take up President Carter on his #NorthKorea offer --&gt; @RepRoKhanna This is not an issue of Republicans or Democrats or left versus right; this is an issue of American national security, and is important to everyone.
Standing with GM Lordstown families today by wearing a blue tie for #TrueBlue Friday. We aren’t ready to give up this fight. #SaveLordstown #DriveitHome @ywchamber
Liberal Democrats now don’t want a vote on their “Green New Deal” because they view it as a “trap” -despite 6 of their presidential candidates announcing their support for it, and dozens of Democratic members ‘co-sponsoring’ this bill! Are you kidding me!?
We all hoped that this week wouldn’t come at the General Motors Facility in #Lordstown, but, here we are. However, we aren’t giving up. #GM #DriveitHomeOhio

The terror attack against Indian forces in Kashmir resulting in over 40 deaths +seriously injuring many more was despicable. Terrorism cannot be accepted in any part of the world, and Pakistan must end the support and safe haven for any terrorists groups operating in its country.

What is Nancy Pelosi afraid of? Sitting behind the President in view of the camera or her chair being empty while he speaks to the American people? #SOTU
Great to hear from Dr. Omid Bagheri, Asst. Professor of Economics @KentState Salem yesterday. We talked about the need for immigration reform. He brought a very interesting perspective being Iranian-born.
Some of Nancy Pelosi’s Democrat colleagues are urging her to be reasonable, to get to the table and negotiate. I agree...the American people want our government open, and they want border security. We should have both. If not now, when?

With the entire federal legislative branch in the same room, it would be a great opportunity to craft a deal - right before the eyes of the American people, so they could see for themselves who is willing to negotiate, and who is not.   #SOTU 2/2

Honored to recognize Jim Sylvi Caporale with a Congressional proclamation on the occasion of their 50th anniversary-to celebrate this joyous milestone they selflessly requested that donations be made to children and their families who are fighting various cancers.
Remember the “stimulus” signed into law by President Obama? Total cost - $830 billion. @POTUS is asking the Democrat House majority for less than $6 billion ($5.7 to be exact) to protect our nation’s border…and can’t get it.

I’m very disappointed with GM’s announcement to close the Lordstown plant. My heart goes out to the hard-working men+women who work there. While locally we have seen a big economic upswing for many industries and sectors, it doesn’t make today’s news any easier to take (1/2)
