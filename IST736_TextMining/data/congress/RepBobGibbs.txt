Whether it is lowering healthcare costs, strengthening American infrastructure, or even securing our borders, there is opportunity to work together if Democrats are willing.
Having worked with the previous Republican Congress to achieve this, the President is right in calling on Democratic leaders to end their impulsive resistance to working with Republicans.
Over the past two years, we have seen incredible job growth and a strong economy fueled by tax cuts for all Americans and regulatory relief for the private sector...
Tonight, the President offered an optimistic vision of how we can work together to tackle important issues in a bipartisan manner--if all parties can agree to come to the table...
