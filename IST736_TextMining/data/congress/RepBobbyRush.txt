Here's what I think about Bill Shine leaving the White House. The House just passed #HR1, a sweeping government reform bill that will end the era of dark money in politics. @HouseDemocrats came together to pass a once-in-a-generation reform package to restore our democracy.
Actually, @HouseDemocrats just voted to:️Get big money out of politics️Ensure clean and fair elections️Strip away corrupt influence in Washington️ To sum up: #HR1 makes sure that Washington works #ForThePeople.
Today, I was proud to vote for #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. This historic legislation will clean up corruption, get dark money out of politics, and restore voting rights. I urge the Senate to pass this legislation so that we can restore Americans’ faith in government.
Leaders. Trailblazers. Artists. Politicians. Caretakers. Today and every day, we honor the women who have changed our lives. #IWD2019
"When a young woman of color sees me in the Speaker’s Chair, I want them to think ‘I can do that,’ that’s part of why I’m here.” — @RepDebHaalandI’m proud to serve in the most diverse Congress in history and celebrate the women who shape our history. #WomensHistoryMonth
A “power grab?” #HR1 isn’t about petty partisan politics — the kind that @senatemajldr and @HouseRepublicans love. It’s about making sure that Washington works #ForThePeople.
Thank you @repmarkpocan for highlighting another difference between the two parties.
There’s nothing partisan or political about ending the scourge of domestic violence and sexual assault. That is why Congress is taking bipartisan action today to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act to support survivors. #VAWA

Republicans have spent the last two years rewarding wealthy donors and special interests while leaving American families behind. That ends now. Democrats are working to pass #HR1 — a once-in-a-generation reform bill to clean up Washington once and for all.
Trump has evaded public accountability for his near-daily attacks on our basic legal, ethical, and constitutional rules and norms. That ends in the #116th Congress. The public deserves to know what is going on and @HouseJudiciary will finally get some answers.
While this is a step in the right direction, the price of this lifesaving medication is still unaffordable for many Americans. We need to do more to make sure that the people who need insulin to live are able to access it in a financially-sustainable way.

Today, we passed #HR1112 and @HouseDemocrats answered the call from many Americans who simply want commonsense legislation that strengthens the background check system. I am proud of the steps we are taking to end the epidemic of gun violence in our country.

Trump on Putin: "...Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today."Trump on Kim Jong-Un: "...I will take him at his word."Trump on the intel community: "The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive..."Trump believes the wrong people.
96% of gun background checks are completed within 3 business days. #HR1112 would allow the FBI additional time to complete the remaining 4% of background checks to ensure firearms don’t fall into the wrong hands.

Congress refused to give @realDonaldTrump funding to build his ineffective, wasteful, multi-billion dollar concrete border wall — so now he has declared a #FakeTrumpEmergency. We’re not going to stand for this.
“Illinois Rep. Bobby Rush was the first congressman to sign on as a co-sponsor of the bill and said that he was overwhelmed and inspired by these students' dedication and persistence.”
The #FakeTrumpEmergency comes with an omelette.
Saddened to learn of another mass shooting. My condolences to the victims and their families. This is a tragedy no community should endure. @HouseDemocrats will examine gun violence and work to advance legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. #EnoughIsEnough #Aurora
The President is declaring an emergency over a crisis that does not exist. But the Senate Leader is trying to blame @HouseDemocrats. Unbelievable. The facts are clear. This is a #FAKENationalEmergency.
My statement on @realDonaldTrump's #FAKENationalEmergency:"Not once on the campaign trail did then-candidate Trump say, ‘Mexico will pay for the wall but when my lie is revealed I will force the taxpayers to fund the wall and when that fails I will declare a national emergency.’
The last #TrumpShutdown cost our economy billions and federal workers are still recovering, which is why I support this deal and urge the President to sign it immediately. Our country cannot endure another reckless shutdown.
This deal will give a 1.9 percent pay raise to federal civilian workers, provide $3 billion for state and local law enforcement, address the opioid crisis, and rebuild America’s infrastructure, which will bring in nearly $100 million in additional highway funding for Illinois.
The government funding deal, which includes seven appropriations bills rejected President Trump’s deep budget cuts and instead make bold investments in top priorities, which will have a positive effect on my constituents in Illinois’ 1st Congressional District.
It denies President Trump the billions of dollars he demanded for a wasteful and ineffective border wall, places a check on his out-of-control deportation policy, funds a more humane immigration system, and provides resources for smart, effective border security.
While this is not the agreement I would have written, it does, reflect the true spirit of compromise and the best possible deal to responsibly fund our government and secure our border. This deal to keep government open secured major victories on our key Democratic priorities.
Today, I voted to prevent another senseless #TrumpShutdown. I am pleased that we were able to work in a bipartisan way to fund the remainder of the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year.
And I will cosponsor it. This #FakeEmergency is a disgrace.
Your tweet thread attempts to trivialize the attack that @JussieSmollett experienced. Regardless of who the perpetrators were, an attack of this nature is and will always be unacceptable.
Here are the facts: There is no “emergency.”An emergency declaration violates existing law.This damages our constitutional system of separation of powers and checks and balances.This is a desperate act by @realDonaldTrump who has failed as a deal maker.
This was a horrific attack and I stand with @USAmbIndia in solidarity in condemning this act of terror. My condolences are with the Indian people, the victims and all families impacted by this tragedy.
