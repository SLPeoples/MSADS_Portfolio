The abrupt closure of 22 Dream Center-owned schools will leave 1000s of students saddled w/ debt an unclear path for how to move fwd w/ obtaining a quality education. The @usedgov has a responsibility to protect these students now must work with them to discharge their loans.
It was wonderful to meet with @AMAmedstudents from Oregon in my office on #InternationalWomensDay. These women represent the next generation of @AmerMedicalAssn doctors and I look forward to seeing what they accomplish.
Today is #InternationalWomensDay! Let’s all take a moment to think about the women who have inspired us. By supporting each other, we can strengthen our influence for good in the world.
We must set a higher bar for protecting workers’ rights. Everyone should be paid fairly for the hours they work.
The Obama Administration issued a stronger rule in 2016 to update the income threshold and guarantee updates every three years. According to the DOL's own estimates, the new proposal from the Trump Administration would cover fewer workers.
The overtime salary threshold is a fundamental tool to make sure that workers are paid fairly for their work. Unfortunately, it has not kept pace with inflation and the needs of working families.
The @USDOL's new overtime proposal fails to adequately address the needs of workers who are struggling to make ends meet. The DOL should be doing more to make sure workers are compensated for the hours they work.
I encourage the Senate to take up the For the People Act so we can strengthen our democracy and remove barriers to voting.
H.R. 1, the #ForThePeople Act, helps states across the country follow Oregon’s lead by expanding automatic voter registration, online registration, and vote-by-mail to make it easier for millions of people to exercise their right to vote.
I am proud to support #HR1 because it includes many overdue government reforms that will make sure the voices of Oregonians and Americans across the country are heard, keeping power in the hands of the people.
It is past time for Congress to strengthen protections for the most fundamental and crucial elements of our democracy: voting rights, elections, and government accountability. #HR1 #ForThePeople

I call on the U.S. Department of Education to protect and promote the civil rights of all students, and promptly enforce the Equity in Individuals with Disabilities Education Act regulation.
The regulation requires states to identify address when students of color are inappropriately identified for special education. A 2013 GAO study found that only about 2% of school districts were taking action despite pervasive persistent disparities.
The disproportionate representation of children of color in special education contributes to segregation in our ed system perpetuates the school-to-prison pipeline. Children with disabilities, particularly African American students, are suspended expelled at higher rates.
I wrote a letter to Secretary DeVos last year to explain problems with the Department of Education’s decision to delay this important rule, which addresses widespread disparities between white students and students of color with disabilities.
I am glad to learn that the DC District Court has vacated the Department of Education’s delay of the “significant disproportionality” rule.
Just this week, the FDA confirmed there was asbestos in cosmetics sold in stores across the country. I encourage my colleagues to protect our communities from this harmful carcinogen by quickly passing the Alan Reinstein Ban Asbestos Now Act.
It is unacceptable that Oregonians and thousands of people across the U.S. continue to die from asbestos-related diseases each year. Thank you to @SenJeffMerkley, @FrankPallone, @RepSlotkin, and @Linda_ADAO for your work on this lifesaving bill.
Asbestos causes disease and death, and we must protect families and communities from this known carcinogen. I am proud to introduce the Alan Reinstein #BanAsbestosNow Act to finally ban the importation, manufacture, and distribution of asbestos.
Reproductive rights are human rights, but last year @StateDept erased #reprorights from its annual Human Rights Reports. This is unacceptable. Today, I joined 148 of my colleagues to introduce the #ReproRightsAreHumanRights Act to require this important reporting.
HBCUs are engines of opportunity and advancement for historically underrepresented students. It was my honor to participate in #HBCUSTEAM Day and talk about how we can fight for equity in education and strengthen the pipeline of people of color in the #STEAM workforce.

We cannot allow predatory lenders to exploit Oregonians and others across the country during times of financial need.
Instead of fighting predatory lending, the Trump administration is easing rules designed to hold payday lenders accountable. Congress must stand up for consumers by passing the SAFE Lending Act.
For too long, predatory lenders have taken advantage of consumers who experience periods of financial instability, pulling families and individuals into a cycle of debt they can’t escape.

Here in Congress, we are finally taking action on serious issues like gun violence and campaign finance reform, which have been ignored or avoided for decades.

I will continue to do all I can to hold Wheeler accountable and provide oversight of the Trump administration’s repeated efforts to undermine protections for public health and our planet.
He continues to put our communities and our planet at risk by dismissing scientists, defending polluters, and ignoring scientific evidence on climate change.
Wheeler’s actions as Acting Administrator demonstrate that he is not committed to protecting public health and the environment, and show that he is willing to act counter to the mission of the Agency he is now confirmed to lead.
The Senate’s confirmation of Andrew Wheeler as Administrator of the EPA is deeply disappointing. It is unacceptable that a former coal lobbyist who ignores science was approved to lead the EPA.
Your advocacy helped make this possible. Thank you for all of your work.

We held a hearing on my bipartisan COAST Research Act to improve research so coastal communities can better prepare for mitigate the effects of climate change. I look forward to working with my colleagues on @HouseScience to pass this legislation quickly
Oregon’s #shellfish industry and researchers at @OregonState have collaborated on mitigation strategies that are helping the shellfish industry survive. Their research shows what is possible when we invest in science to help coastal communities adapt to climate change.
The economic vitality of coastal states like Oregon depends on the health of our oceans, but #GHG emissions and #ClimateChange are causing ocean chemistry to change. Acidic waters make it difficult for shellfish and marine life to build their shells and skeletal structures.

Evidence shows that Oregon and other states that have already passed comprehensive background checks have 35% fewer gun deaths, and 47% fewer women shot by their intimate partners. Congress is finally doing more than offering thoughts and prayers.
By passing #HR8, we are heeding the call of the hundreds of thousands of students who marched for their lives. This bill will save lives because it requires a background check for nearly all firearm sales and transfers. #EndGunViolence

Quality health care should be available for all, not just the wealthy. I encourage my colleagues to pass #MedicareForAll.
#MedicareforAll is especially important for people with pre-existing conditions, like:o Jennifer, a 57-year-old with high blood pressure who works freelance short-term jobso Diane, a 60-year-old small business owner who has arthritis a son with autism
Everyone should have access to affordable, quality health care. I’m proud to co-sponsor #MedicareForAll, which would provide needed system-wide reforms.
Protecting public lands reflects our state's best values – environmental protection, stewardship of our land, community partnership. I will continue to fight to protect our nation’s natural resources so our public lands may be enjoyed and preserved for future generations.
The package includes several provisions from @RonWyden's Oregon Wildlands Act. It would create the Devil’s Staircase Wilderness, and protect the Chetco River, Rogue River, Molalla River, Jenny Creek, Wasson Creek, Franklin Creek, and Elk River.
Today the House passed a broad public lands package with my support. The bill will permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. #LWCF makes it possible for us all to enjoy the precious outdoor areas that make Oregon so special.
Oregonians know that protecting our #PublicLands, national parks, forests, scenic areas, and wildlife refuges, means protecting the natural beauty and recreation our communities enjoy and the robust habitats fish and wildlife depend on for survival.
After a quiet decision to change leadership at @NOAA yesterday, it appears that Neil Jacobs may have significant conflicts of interest because of his previous work at Panasonic Avionics Corporation. I will work with my colleagues to call on Dr. Jacobs to provide more information.
Additionally this is the longest NOAA has gone without a permanent, confirmed Administrator. There are also significant concerns about conflicts of interest regarding Pres. Trump's nominee, Barry Myers, who led AccuWeather, a private forecasting firm that relies on data from @NWS
The public deserves to know that the @NOAA Administrator is acting in the best interest of improving our scientific understanding of changes in climate weather and the effects on oceans coasts, not putting industry interests ahead of the public good.
Schools in Oregon and across the country are in desperate need of repair and improvements. I’m proud @EdLaborCmte passed the Rebuild America’s Schools Act today to provide critical resources that will help schools prepare for earthquakes tsunamis, replace pipes, and more.
Gender-based wage discrimination is an injustice to millions of working families. The Paycheck Fairness Act, which passed @EdLaborCmte today, will help achieve #EqualPayForEqual work by eliminating loopholes that have allowed gender-based wage discrimination to continue.
I urge my colleagues to join me in rejecting the President’s abuse of power.
Building this wall is not a good investment and it will not stop crime or illegal immigration along our southern border. Instead of building walls, we should instead build bridges to those who are fleeing violence and legally seeking asylum in our country.
I support taking action to make sure we have the appropriate personnel, equipment, facilities, and resources to protect our borders from criminal activity like trafficking in drugs or people.
This declaration is an unacceptable abuse of power that circumvents the constitutional authority of Congress.
The President is using this declaration as a false pretense to divert taxpayer money, primarily away from the Department of Defense, toward the construction of a wasteful, ineffective wall along the southern border.
Today I will vote in favor of the resolution to terminate the President’s declaration of a national emergency. No such emergency exists on the U.S.-Mexico border.

We don't need a new panel to tell us if #ClimateChange threatens national security. Scientists from 13 federal agencies already outlined the connection between climate change national security in the Trump Admin’s Fourth National Climate Assessment #NCA4

We have the opportunity to disrupt a national cycle of discriminatory pay that keeps too many women and families in poverty. We can finally make equal pay for equal work a reality by passing the #PaycheckFairness Act.
Several states, including Oregon, have acted to address pay inequities, but it is time for Congress to address persistent wage discrimination nationwide.
The lack of easily accessible data on wages makes discrimination difficult to detect, let alone prevent. Even when wage discrimination is discovered, working women still face significant barriers to meet the heavy burden of proof for holding employers accountable.
The Equal Pay Act has been law for more than a half century, but in 2019 #EqualPayForEqualWork is not always a reality. Across the country, far too many women are still being paid less than men for doing the same work.
In 1963, Pres. Kennedy signed the #EqualPay Act and our country enshrined into law a fundamental concept: equal pay for equal work, regardless of sex. We have made progress, but unfortunately loopholes and insufficient enforcement have allowed wage discrimination to persist.

The color of our oceans is going to change as a result of greenhouse gas emissions and changes to phytoplankton.
Our oceans absorb about 93% of the heat trapped by human greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in sea levels rising, coral bleaching, changes to fish migration patterns, more extreme weather events.
The scientific evidence about the effects of #climatechange on oceans is alarming. The latest National Climate Assessment dedicated an entire chapter to the consequences of inaction for oceans marine resources. We must act quickly to #ProtectOurOceans
As Co-Chair of the House Oceans Caucus, I know that the health of our oceans reflects the health of our planet. I’m glad that my colleagues on @NRDems are working to #ProtectOurOceans and held a hearing today on ocean health climate change. #ActOnClimate
The most recent increase to the federal minimum wage in 2007 failed to address inflation rates, driving persistent income inequality. Congress must act. The #RaiseTheWage Act is good for workers and good for the economy.
The origins of a tipped minimum wage are deeply intertwined with the history of slavery in the US. Oregon is one of seven states that prohibit employers from paying tipped workers a subminimum wage. The #RaiseTheWage Act will gradually phase it out at the federal level.
The majority of workers earning a minimum wage are women and people of color. The #RaiseTheWage Act will address these persistent wage gaps and allow workers to afford the “bare necessities of life” as intended by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
When workers are paid wages that leave them in poverty, they struggle to pay for rising rent, essentials like food transportation, and child care. In Washington County, a worker making the local min wage would have to work 73 hrs/wk to afford a one-bedroom apartment.
