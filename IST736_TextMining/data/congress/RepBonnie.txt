@robbiedaly @MadisonSiriusXM @MrDavidJohns I read about that too. Unfortunately a bone marrow transplant is not a viable option for most people with HIV/AIDS. PrEP is a far safer option.
Women across the country are sharing their stories of domestic violence. Listen to them. The Violence Against Women Act lapsed during the shutdown. It’s time to reauthorize it.
This morning, I had the incredible opportunity to discuss HIV/AIDS and treatment, including my bill to make PrEP more accessible with @MadisonSiriusXM and @MrDavidJohns

There is much work to be done to address economic injustice. I will continue to work to ensure women are paid fairly. #InternationalWomensDay
I’d like to remind everyone recognizing #InternationalWomensDay that the gender pay gap persists in the United States. Today, a woman’s earnings are 80% of a man’s. The gap is even worse for Hispanic (53%), Black (61%), AIAN (58%), and Native Hawaiian women (62%).
PrEP is the closest thing we have right now to a vaccine for HIV and yet it’s underutilized, particularly by those with the highest risk.

A3 cont: And It as much the result of the public and private discourse at our kitchen tables and barbershops as it is about our access to both the facilities and socioeconomic opportunities that correlate to better health #NWGHAAD

I’ve introduced the Prohibit Auto Insurance Descrimination Act (or PAID Act) to put a stop to the policy that descriminates against good drivers simply because they make less money or don’t have a higher degree
The fact is, someone’s profession, income, or level of education - all used by insurance companies to determine your rate - have nothing to do with someone’s risk of having an accident. This policy is discriminatory and must end.
The bill to overturn President Trump's National Emergency Declaration overwhelmingly passed the House 245-182 with bipartisan support. The House is exercising it's constitutional duty. Will the Senate?
Securing the right of all Americans to vote was once a bi-partisan issue with renewals of the Voting Rights Act occurring 5 times under both Republican and Democratic Presidents and Congresses. I call on all my colleagues to support this legislation. #restorethevote

There is no such thing as abortion after the birth of a child - a lie @realDonaldTrump repeated again last night. That is an egregious lie presented solely to score political points. He's trying to deceive people in an effort to distract from his horrendous record on healthcare.

One of the goals in creating the @CFPB was to protect hardworking Americans from lenders who would seek to take advantage of them. The Trump Administration has sought to undermine it since Day One. This is the latest step in that effort.

In the last Congress, Republicans passed a tax bill that did a lot for corporations, wealthy shareholders, and high-paid CEOs. Yet, as many people are going to discover on this year's returns, it did little for regular Americans. THIS Congress is going to change that.
Students often struggle with real-time costs and future debt for the education they need to pursue their dreams. The #EITC Modernization Act would allow roughly 3 million students who are eligible for Pell Grants (many of whom have dependents) to receive the EITC.
By 2020, an estimated 117 Million Americans will need caregiver assistance. Often this care is given by unpaid caregivers, primarily women, who provided billions of dollars in unpaid care in the United States in 2012 yet are 30% more likely to face financial instability.
When EITC has been expanded, poverty decreases and financial stability increases for working- and middle-class people. The #EITC Modernization Act increases allows caregivers and students to access EITC.
While Republicans propose more tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires on the false promise that the money will "trickle down" to everyone else (a promise that has failed to materialize over and over) the Earned Income Tax Credit has been proven to work.
Working families are no longer making ends meet. Wage growth for most workers has been stagnant while costs have gone up. The ability to save is non-existent, a medical emergency or a broken-down car can send people over the edge.
This Congress I'll be reintroducing the #EITC Modernization Act, a bill that would make a simple but important change to the tax code, allowing caregivers and full-time, emancipated higher-education students to receive the earned income tax credit.
