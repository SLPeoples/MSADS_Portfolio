More good news for Ohioans. Thanks to tax reform, Ohioans are projected to save on utility bills.

“The tax cuts and the lifting of regulatory burden have produced an economic takeoff that had failed to occur under the policies of the previous administration, despite a doubling of the national debt and the greatest monetary easing in the history of the Federal Reserve.”

A secure border ensures the health and safety of all Americans #SecureOurBorder
Border security is a key component of our national security, the common defense, and homeland security. #SecureOurBorder
Sometime between 9/11 and today, our conversation about border security got muddled. The wall, border patrol, surveillance of human trafficking routes – all of these have been recast exclusively into the context of immigration policy.
I am grateful to live in a nation where more people want to come in, not out. However, open or unsecure borders put the lawless ahead of those who play by the rules. #SecureOurBorder
Funding for border security shouldn’t be a political point. This should be about keeping Americans safe, keeping illicit drugs out of our country, protecting families, and our precious lives. #SecureOurBorder
Lawmakers take an oath to the Constitution. We fail in our sworn duty if we refuse to ensure the sovereignty, security, and well-being of this nation through secure borders. #SecureOurBorder
Our government was founded for one purpose: to fulfill the charges set forth in the Constitution, “. . .establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty.”
Our border security weaknesses invite a humanitarian crisis. Without a wall, we leave room for drug smugglers, human traffickers, and other threats to enter our country. We must secure our borders to know who and what is coming into our country. #SecureOurBorder
60,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended crossing the border last month. We need a wall and increased border security to help enforce and strengthen our nation’s legal immigration processes. #SecureOurBorder
Both parties agree that we have a border security crisis but Republicans also have an answer. Congress needs to approve wall funding in order to properly address the national security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border. #SecureOurBorder
Today we mourn the loss of a dedicated officer and a hero in his community. My thoughts and prayers go out to the family and loved ones of Colerain Township Police Officer Dale Woods.

Record low unemployment, hundreds of thousands of job additions, increased wages show that tax reform the Republican pro-growth agenda are strengthening our economy. Dems want to undo tax reform, which would reverse these trends. We must defend economic prosperity growth.
I am disappointed by my Democratic colleagues' refusal to fund the wall and much-needed border security. We have a constitutional duty to protect our nation and its citizens—a failure to secure the border neglects this responsibility.

Border security is national security
Immigration reform is not possible without a secure border
Read more on why securing the border is an important part of the fight against the opioid crisis:
Lawmakers take an oath to the Constitution. We fail in our sworn duty if we refuse to ensure the sovereignty, security, and well-being of this nation through secure borders.
Our government was founded for one purpose: to fulfill the charges set forth in the Constitution, “. . .establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty.”
Earlier tonight, I took to the House floor to explain why I voted to increase funding for border security.
Today’s historic bipartisan First Step Act does just that - reduces recidivism, reforms sentencing, and increases community safety.
Our criminal justice system should be tough but fair. I applaud any measure that helps those leaving prison to become contributing members of society, rather than return to a life of crime.
