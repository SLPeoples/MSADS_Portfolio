Worse yet, it permits the use of taxpayer funds for the advancement of hate speech by fringe groups on the far right and far left, and permits the use of taxpayer funds for more false and misleading TV ads, robocalls, mail, etc., which Americans are already sick and tired of. 4/9

I helped introduce H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, which is a first step to preventing gun violence. This bipartisan bill is just one of many steps I’m taking to protect our communities. (4/4)
We must close loopholes in our background check system so that people cannot purchase a firearm unless they clear a background check. This will not restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens, it will prevent those seeking to harm others from accessing firearms. (3/4)
Since I took office in 2017, our state and nation have experienced many tragedies involving firearms. I’ve spoken with countless people in our community and we all agree - it’s time to act. (2/4)
It’s time for common sense laws to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and those who are a danger to themselves and others. Today I joined Parkland survivors and my colleagues who are committed to keeping our communities safe. (1/4)

Great news this morning as U.S. employers added the most workers in 10 months as wage gains accelerated and labor-force participation jumped.
Today, I voted to support the House rules package, which seeks to break gridlock in Congress. Read my full statement:
These ideas introduced today transcend political parties and strike at the heart of what our country needs: a rebirth of belief in our leaders and institutions so we can tackle the challenges we face and accomplish great things in this new era.
It is an honor to represent and serve the people of Bucks and Montgomery counties in the 116th Congress. I look forward to serving as their independent voice in Washington during a time when our citizens face broken Washington.
Government shutdowns are not an effective way to govern. Read my full statement, including my intention to abide by my ‘No Budget, No Pay’ proposal:
Today’s action demonstrates an investment and confidence in our fellow Americans. While there is still more work to accomplish, this vote marks a generational shift towards a criminal justice system that establishes a more practical framework to keep our communities safe.
I’m proud to cast my vote in support of the FIRST STEP Act with my fellow Problem Solvers Caucus members today. As a former FBI agent, I understand criminal justice reform is critically important to reducing crime and recidivism.
Federal workers work hard every day. While the Senate previously approved a 1.9 percent increase, I am disappointed it was not included in this latest spending package. Members of @AFGENational @3Afge simply deserve better.

The FBI, the Pittsburgh Police Department and first responders are selflessly working to secure the scene and save lives. Action must, and will, be taken to end this hated against our Jewish Faith Community and all of our communities.
I am closely monitoring the tragic situation at the Tree of Life Congregation Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Hateful rhetoric and acts of violence in a synagogue—or any other peaceful house of worship—is the epitome of evil. An attack on the Jewish faith community is an attack on all.
I have full confidence that law enforcement will apprehend those responsible for this despicable operation. The perpetrators of these acts will be held accountable. We must stand together against those who seek to divide us through evil, as violence has no place in our society.
These actions are appalling and a setback to civil political discourse. Terrorism is a tool of the weak and must be universally condemned by all Americans, regardless of political persuasion.
The attempted attacks against the Obama and Clinton families, Governor Cuomo, CNN and others are vile acts of terrorism. These malicious efforts to divide Americans endangered public servants, media personnel, and the public at large.
