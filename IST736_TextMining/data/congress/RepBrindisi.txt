Happy Anniversary to the @AmericanLegion! The American Legion has served veterans and servicemembers for the last 100 years, and I was proud to honor their achievements at American Legion Riders Post 189 in Norwich.
We introduced a bill to hold cable and internet companies accountable for frequent rate hikes, poor quality, and bad customer service. Do you have a story you want to share? Tell us here:
ICYMI: We’re working to crack down on unwanted, intrusive robocalls. We co-sponsored the Spam Calls Task Force Act and called on the FCC to take immediate action. Read more here:

#HR1 PASSED: Today I voted to help fix our broken political system, reduce corporate influence, ensure everyday people’s voices are heard. We also passed my amendment to extend voting hours in Upstate New York. I'll keep working to deliver results for #NY22.
Happy #InternationalWomensDay! Today we celebrate all the incredible, hardworking women in our lives. I'll keep working in Congress to stand up for #NY22 women and families, like passing the #PaycheckFairnessAct to finally ensure equal pay for equal work.
This week, the House and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committees continued hearing from veterans service organizations on their legislative agendas. Thank you to all the men and women who work tirelessly to ensure our veterans have the support and resources they need.

We’re working to provide better oversight of cable and internet providers. When a company enters into an agreement, it should be required to hold up its part of the bargain.  We can’t keep giving these companies a free pass. Read more from @uticaOD:
Our team joined the City of Binghamton to raise a flag in honor of #WomensHistoryMonth and celebrate the incredible accomplishments of women in #NY22 and across the country!
I've heard countless stories from Upstate NYers who feel like they are being cheated by their cable company. That’s why my first bill is focused on holding cable internet companies accountable. Here are a few of the stories we heard. Share yours here �
Conservation shouldn’t be a red issue or a blue issue, it should be a green issue. Proud to join members from both sides of the aisle to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund and protect our environment, public lands, and outdoor economy.

Joined @RepKatko to make sure @JeffBezos @amazon knows Upstate New York is ready and willing to be open for business.
I agree with members on both sides of the aisle that declaring a national emergency sets a dangerous precedent, undermines the role of Congress and our Constitution, distracts from our ability to find serious, long-term solutions.
8.7M people in NY are not getting high-speed internet, and Chenango Tioga counties have some of the worst broadband coverage in NY. This is exactly why I invited FCC Chairman Pai to #NY22. He needs to see firsthand the challenges rural consumers face.
It’s also an example of what we can accomplish if we put aside our differences and work together to find common ground. That’s the kind of leadership our country deserves, and it’s the approach I’ll continue to take. (2/2)
I am glad both sides were able to work together to prevent another govt shutdown. Shutdowns hurt everyday Americans threaten our country’s safety security.  This deal is not perfect, but it is an important step to help secure our border and keep our country safe. (1/2)
There are real consequences to these all-or-nothing political games, where people refuse to work together to find common ground. NY has now lost thousands of good-paying jobs revenue that could have been invested in our roads, bridges, schools communities all across NY state.
Join me next week for our Utica and Binghamton open houses! Stop by to meet our team and learn more about how we can help with issues like veterans’ benefits, Social Security and Medicare, health care, student loans, grant applications, more! More details �

For years, Sauquoit Creek flooding has wreaked havoc in Oneida County - threatening people’s homes and livelihoods. @SenSchumer, Sen. @gillibrandny, and I called on @FEMA to provide the Town of Whitestown much-needed funds to help mitigate future damage.
ALL TIME HIGH: Our natl debt just passed $22 trillion. This is irresponsible and threatens our natl economic security. I joined @HouseBlueDog co-chairs to call on Republicans Democrats to commit to fiscal responsibility address our skyrocketing debt:

UNACCEPTABLE: @NYSDPS has given Charter ANOTHER extension to come up with their New York state exit plan. This is completely unacceptable. Charter has taken advantage of consumers, and the PSC must hold them accountable.

Excited to get to work on @VetAffairsDems and @HouseAgDems Committees and bring the voices of NY-22 farmers and veterans to Congress.
RT @HouseAgDems: Welcome to the House Ag team, Congressman!
I’m setting up 2 advisory councils made up of folks from NY-22 who can help guide my work in Congress. I will meet regularly with our Vets our Ag Advisory Councils to hear directly from those on the frontlines about the challenges they face and the work that needs to be done.
On the @VetAffairsDems committee, I will work every day to meet the needs of our veterans and ensure the VA has the tools and resources it needs to give veterans the best possible care.
The NY-22 dairy industry supports nearly 4,000 direct jobs, more than $235 million in wages, and generates an economic impact of $1.83 billion. On the @HouseAgDems Committee, I’ll make sure our dairy farmers have the support and resources they need to thrive.
Excited to stand with NY-22 veterans and farmers today to announce that I will serve on the @VetAffairsDems and @HouseAgDems Committees.
Our mistake. Today’s news conference at Smith Post in Rome announcing appointment to @HouseAgDems @VetAffairsDems committees.
U
Our thoughts are with the families of the four Americans whose lives were tragically taken during the attack in Syria. We mourn our country’s loss and thank our service members and their families for their service and sacrifice.
We have to get the government up and running and have serious discussions about border security. As long as the government is closed, our security, safety and economy are at risk.

FDA listened to our concerns will restart food safety inspections for high-risk foods; however, employees won't be paid some inspections still won't happen. This is an important step but not a real solution. Let's work together end the shutdown now.
Tune in tonight.
We need food inspectors back on the job. The House passed bipartisan legislation to reopen USDA and FDA - time for the Senate to do the same. Read more from @RomeSentinel ️
Stopping routine inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables and other foods puts us all at risk. This shutdown has real consequences for everyday people and has gone on long enough. We need to end this shutdown now.
This investment will not only bring good-paying jobs to our region, it also puts the Southern Tier at the forefront of a brand-new industry. This is exactly the innovative, forward-thinking action we need to grow our economy create opportunity for people in the Southern Tier.
This shutdown has real consequences for everyday people. Families shouldn’t have to worry if the food they’re eating is safe, and farmers shouldn’t have to worry that government dysfunction could threaten their livelihood.
Stopping routine food safety inspections of seafood, fruits, vegetables and other foods at high risk of contamination because of the federal government’s shutdown is a recipe for disaster. Mitch McConnell should bring the bill to reopen USDA and FDA to the Senate floor now.
Stopping routine food safety inspections because of the govt shutdown is a recipe for disaster. We need to get USDA and FDA employees back to work. The House passed a bipartisan bill last week to reopen these agencies. Mitch McConnell needs to bring it to the Senate floor now.
FDA SHUTDOWN: Bad food on store shelves here at home would be a recipe for disaster and something we need to fix ASAP. More later this morning.
I will hold a town hall each month, visiting every county in #NY22 in 2019. First stop: Binghamton on Tuesday, January 22. See you there!
It's time for Congress to do its job. That means listening to YOU and working hard to solve problems. I will hold town halls in every county in the district and fight for commonsense solutions like #NoBudgetNoPay to hold Congress accountable.
Today the House passed a bipartisan bill to help combat anti-Semitism. We must continue to unite around actions that put an end to hatred and violence targeting Jewish communities here and around the world.
Looking forward to our first of many #NY22 town halls! See you Tuesday, January 22nd at American Legion Post 1645 in Binghamton.

Today I voted to reopen important agencies including the IRS. Washington’s dysfunction shouldn’t stop people from getting their tax refunds on time.
We can't go back to when insurers could deny coverage or raise costs for people w/ pre-existing conditions. Time to stop the partisan games find solutions to protect those w/pre-existing conditions, lower RX prices ensure everyone has access to quality, affordable health care
Today is Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. Thank you to all the men and women who put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe.
We just passed bipartisan legislation in the House to reopen the govt hopefully the President’s message tonight will spur Mitch McConnell to bring this same legislation to the Senate so we can address comprehensive border security and immigration reform in a functioning govt.
The President’s address to the nation underscores my main hope: to end this needless shutdown before it does lasting damage.
Each month, I will hold a town hall in #NY22 because listening to you is my top priority. Excited to kick things off in Binghamton on Tuesday, January 22 at 6pm at American Legion Post 1645 (39 Louisa St, Binghamton). Hope to see you there!
Today I cosponsored the No Budget No Pay Act because if members of Congress can't do their jobs and pass a budget, they shouldn't get paid.
This government shutdown isn’t good for anyone. That’s why, until the President can signal to Mitch McConnell what to bring to the floor of the Senate and pass, I will be pushing to open various agencies that YOU depend on every day. We should be able to do that much.
My main focus: get things done for the people of Upstate New York.
