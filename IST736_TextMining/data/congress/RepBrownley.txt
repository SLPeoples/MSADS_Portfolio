I am especially pleased that this legislation includes two bills I authored to end partisan gerrymandering and fix the redistricting process. In Congress, I will continue to work to return our government to one that is of, by, and for the people once again.
Today, the House passed #HR1 — a major win for our democracy for the American people. We are one step closer to passing transformative legislation to fight special interests, take money out of politics finally put the power of our democracy back in the hands of the people.
I met w/ Stephanie Wiggins, new CEO of @Metrolink, to discuss this important part of Ventura County’s transportation system. As a member of @TransportDems, I'll continue to work diligently to secure funds for local transportation initiatives that keep our community safe moving.
My favorite 3 words in our Constitution are the first 3 words: #WeThePeople.The will of the public is the basis of our entire democracy. But for far too long, special interests have rigged the system against everyday Americans.That changes with #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.

On this day in 1980, Channel Islands National Park officially became America’s 40th national park. We are so lucky to have this gem right in our backyard, and I will continue to fight to protect America’s beautiful lands so they can be enjoyed by future generations.
Last week, @VetAffairsDems held hearings with VA @SecWilkie, @DAVHQ @AmericanLegion to discuss the issues facing @DeptVetAffairs. As Chairwoman of Health Subcommittee, I will continue working with our VSOs VA to ensure our vets get high-quality care they've earned deserve.
That is why I am proud to support the Servicemember and Veterans’ Empowerment and Support Act, which will help make reporting and seeking care for military sexual assault easier, and ensure that these survivors can get the support and care that they have earned and deserve.
It is simply unacceptable that any member of our Armed Forces has to endure sexual trauma, and our country continues to fail survivors by putting up unnecessary roadblocks for them to get the care they need.
I am looking forward to continuing to work with members of the Caucus to ensure our military has the resources needed to support our major range and test facility bases, like @NBVCCalifornia, which play a critical role in protecting the U.S. military’s technological advantages.
I am proud to announce that @DesJarlaisTN04 and I will serve as co-chairs of the Congressional Range and Testing Center Caucus in the 116th Congress.
The Congressional Award recognizes young people for achieving goals in volunteer public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition/exploration. I look forward to seeing where the future takes both of these terrific young people!
Recently, I had the pleasure of presenting the Congressional Award’s Gold Medal to Mark Hanson of Oxnard and the Bronze Medal to Jacqueline Emanuel of Thousand Oaks.
Recently, I met with constituents from the Southwinds Neighborhood of Oxnard to discuss their concerns and to hear how we can work together to ensure our cities and neighborhoods receive the support and resources they need to thrive.
I will continue to work across the aisle to end the veteran homelessness crisis, ensure we continue funding important housing communities like the Ormond Beach Villas, and advance bills I’ve authored to strengthen federal programs that help homeless veterans find safe housing.
It is simply unacceptable that any veteran is living out on the street. Recently, I had the opportunity to tour the Ormond Beach Villas, a new affordable housing community designed specifically for veterans and their families in Oxnard.
Protecting every American’s right to vote is critical. That is why I am supporting the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which will address the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Shelby County v. Holder directing Congress to update the Voting Rights Act. #VRAA #RestoreTheVOTE
I support the Child Care for Working Families Act because it will:️ Ensure parents have quality, affordable child care️ Expand access to quality preschool️ Ensure that teachers are paid a living wage so they can support themselves their families #ChildCare4All
I'm hosting Income Tax Assistance Workshop on 3/23 from 11 a.m. – 3 p.m. in Oxnard for constituents whose income is less than $55,000 per year. Volunteer tax preparers will meet one-on-one with constituents. To schedule appointment, call my district office at (805) 379-1779.
As a member of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, I will be focused on bold steps that we can take to ensure that our country's infrastructure is supporting and advancing our efforts to combat the climate crisis.
Infrastructure investment will play a pivotal role as we #ActOnClimate to steer our nation to a cleaner, greener future. This week, @TransportDems heard from experts on how we can help communities reduce carbon emissions and make our infrastructure more resilient.

Today, I voted to permanently reauthorize the Land Water Conservation Fund, which has protected our nat'l parks open spaces for decades. I'll continue to fight to protect wild lands, including right here in Ventura County, so they can be enjoyed by future generations.

The 1928 Saint Francis Dam collapse was one of the deadliest tragedies in CA history, yet the events of this historic day aren’t widely known. The bill @RepKatieHill I co-authored to memorialize this disaster for future generations is finally on its way to the President's desk!
President Trump’s #FakeEmergency declaration makes a mockery of our Constitution and the will of the American people. My full statement on today’s vote to terminate it 
From the establishment of the 805UndocuFund, to the halt of the NRG power plant proposal, to ongoing efforts for community-driven change on the environment, I commend the good work that CAUSE is doing across the Central Coast.
I recently had the opportunity to meet with representatives of @CAUSE805 to discuss how the initiatives the organization is undertaking to address voter engagement participation, environmental justice climate change protections for our region’s working families.
I look forward to continuing to work with them to ensure all veterans have access to high-quality care in a safe and welcoming environment.
I was so pleased to meet recently with Paula Kemp and Suzanne Baeza with Veteran Sisters to discuss how the VA can better address the unique needs and concerns of the growing population of women veterans.
Over the years, we've seen successful expansion growth of the Port as a critical point of entry to our economy. These projects will support growth of exports imports, reduce congestion most importantly, help create sustain good-paying jobs at Port throughout our region.
Yesterday, I had the pleasure of participating in the groundbreaking of critical upgrades to the @portofhueneme including wharf improvements, berth and harbor deepening, pavement improvements, and the modernization of cargo handling facilities.
As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Quiet Skies Caucus, I will continue to fight to address the impact airplane noise has on my constituents.
Most recently, I co-sponsored the Air Traffic Noise Pollution Expert Consensus Act, which will require the FAA to sponsor a National Academies Expert Consensus Report, to ensure we have the best information on the health impacts of air traffic noise and pollution.
I have heard from many of my constituents in Ventura County about airplane noise in our district that is disrupting daily lives and diminishing quality-of-life, and I have been hard at work to address this issue in Congress.
Every student should have access to a safe, welcoming, and high-quality public school. That’s why I support the Rebuild America’s Schools Act, which would invest more than $100 billion to improve public schools across the country #BuildSchoolsNotWalls
They include:️Incentivizing states to implement extreme risk protection orders to keep guns out of hands of individuals in crisis️Banning high-capacity magazines that make shooters more dangerous️Reinstating assault weapons ban to get weapons of war out of our communities
There is no single answer that will stop all gun violence, but there are clearly common sense steps that we must take. That’s why I also support other critical policies that were introduced last week.
As we marked 1 year since #Parkland last week, House Dems moved forward with 1st major gun safety bill in decades. I’m proud to support #HR8, which passed out of @HouseJudiciary last week is a critical 1st step to keeping guns out of the hands of those who shouldn’t have them.
During #BlackHistoryMonth, we come together to reflect and honor the invaluable contributions the African-American community has made – and continues to make – to the fabric of our nation’s history. #BHM
I am pleased that Congress has reached bipartisan agreement to prevent another shutdown and fund key priorities for Ventura County, including infrastructure investment and further securing our borders. My full statement ️

Vets who are in crisis or are having thoughts of suicide, or those who know a vet in need, can call Veterans Crisis Line for confidential intervention and support 24 hours a day. Call 800-273-8255 press 1, send text message to 838255, or chat online at
In 2016, legislation I authored to analyze efficacy of suicide prevention programs based on gender was signed into law. This will continue to be major focus of mine as Chairwoman of VA Health Subcommittee because female vets face suicide rate nearly twice that of civilian women.
This week marks 4 years since landmark Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act was signed into law while we've made strides in improving vets’ access to quality mental health care, there's still more work to be done to end devastating veteran suicide epidemic.

We will continue to stand for hope and against hate, because as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, “Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.”

While this was an important step forward, there's still more that we must do to ensure workers have access to paid leave so they can continue to make ends meet pay the bills. In Congress, I'll continue to fight to ensure workers have access to paid time off when they need it.

The two issues are inextricably connected, and the path to righting the ship requires rational solutions consistent with our values.
Going forward, we must work together to craft legislation that not only protects our borders, but also honors the contributions immigrants have always made, and continue to make, to our success as a nation.
His threat that he may do it again shows that he caved to pressure, not that he learned from his mistake.
While it is high time that President Trump finally agreed to reopen the government, the fact that he held 800,000 workers hostage to use as leverage for something he couldn’t get through the appropriate legislative process is simply reprehensible.
In Congress, I will continue to work to ensure that the VA is ready to meet the needs of this growing population of women veterans so they can get the care they have earned and deserve.
As more women serve our nation in uniform, it is imperative that they have access to high-quality, gender-specific care in a safe and welcoming environment.
Today marks six years since the Defense Department rescinded the ban on women serving in direct combat and opened our military up to a new generation of American heroes.

I am incredibly honored and humbled to serve alongside so many incredible women in the 116th Congress, and I look forward to working with them as we pick up the torch and continue to fight for equal rights.
Although there remains much work to be done to ensure equal treatment for all, we are reminded of all the great American women who are blazing a trail for one another and fighting for a more perfect union.
I know our solutions may vary, but we're all striving for a more perfect union where our democracy creates conditions for equality, opportunity, justice security for all. Those are the principles I continue to be guided by I know they are the principles you want me to uphold.
So it is on this day that I want to reiterate to you that I am working hard to represent your interests during this very challenging time, and I will continue to engage in a dialogue with you.
This is also Day 31 of the longest government shutdown in our nation’s history. As Martin Luther King would have made clear if he were here today, our democracy is stronger when we communicate with each other, and the best policy comes from collaboration.
Today is also the anniversary of the flawed Citizens United ruling by #SCOTUS that allows the voice of the wealthy few to have undue influence in our elections and our democratic process — making our country inherently less equal and less just, a far cry from Dr. King’s vision.
Today we honor the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. — a man who dedicated his life to the principles of equality democracy who believed dialogue, not monologue, is essential to moving our country forward to more quickly bending the arc of history toward justice for all.
