The president set forth an agenda that strengthens families and workers. There are clearly areas he discussed that both parties can work on to solve problems. I’m committed to cutting through the dysfunction in Washington and working with my colleagues to get results. #SOTU
“'My goal is to be as accessible as I can,’” Steil said. “‘I love hearing what people’s thoughts are on policies...I’m one month in, so I’m learning. What I want to be is your voice in Washington. To do that, I need to listen.'"More on my listening session in Bristol below:

Now that we have a deal, let’s get to work on a permanent solution to fund the government and secure our border.
Today, I grabbed coffee with a local mother whose daughter serves in the Coast Guard. Her story is like many others throughout the country right now. We must do our jobs, find common ground, and end this shutdown.
Hitting the road this morning for a busy day in #WI01...I knew it was cold...I didn’t think it was THAT cold!
A couple of things...1- Today’s vote in the House was more political theater, not a solution to end the shutdown2- We should be in D.C. tomorrow and every day until we reopen the governmentLet’s do our jobs, stay in D.C., and end this shutdown!
The Coast Guard's commitment to serving our country is admirable. Many are reporting to duty, without pay, to protect our nation. The shutdown should've ended 34 days ago, but if it lasts a day longer, we must pass this bill today so @USCG can receive pay.
Every child should have the opportunity to attend a school that is best for them. In fact, 81,000 students in Wisconsin attend a private voucher or a charter school. #SchoolChoice

Attended today’s One Voice, Many Stories #MLKDay celebration at @gatewaytech in Kenosha. Great to honor those in Southeast Wisconsin who continue to inspire and embody MLK’s spirit. “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’” -MLK
Today we honor the legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. I joined the Southeastern Wisconsin Baptist Pastors Fellowship for their Dr. King’s Celebration event on Friday—a great evening. We should all strive to incorporate MLK’s teachings into our daily lives and communities. #MLKDay
Thanks to everyone who came out to today’s swearing-in ceremonies in Racine and Janesville! Special thanks to Judges Boyle and Werner for administering the oath of office. It’s a great honor to serve the people of Southeast Wisconsin. #WI01
Today, President Trump offered a path to end the shutdown. Now it is time for Senate Democrats and Nancy Pelosi to display a similar willingness to compromise and finally bring an end to this impasse. I'm hopeful that with the president’s offer, real progress is finally possible.
Huge win!!! #OnWisconsin
