Somehow, not a single Republican voted for this bill.  Yet consistently we find these same Republicans supporting voter suppression and restrictive voter ID laws in their home states. We must fight #ForThePeople because this still AMERICA.
This bill is also a bill of second chances. The #ForThePeople Act also restores the right to vote to Americans who served their full sentences and paid their debts to society.
It should not matter who your parents are, the color of your skin, or where you live. If you are an American citizen, you deserve to vote without fear, intimidation and discrimination.  Period.
