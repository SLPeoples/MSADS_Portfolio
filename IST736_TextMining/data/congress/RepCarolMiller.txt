This #InternationalWomansDay we must focus on building up women and making sure our daughters and granddaughters have more opportunities. I am honored to stand by other women and give our unique voice to this Congress.
I asked for unanimous consent from the House to consider the Born Alive Act. This is the 15th time Democrats have voted to not protect babies who survive abortion. We must do better. 
I spoke with Kris Warner, the WV Director of @USDA, this morning to talk about how we can work together and fund projects to improve water, sewer and infrastructure in our community. As a member of @TransportGOP, I am committed to rebuilding our state!
As a wife, a mother, and a grandmother, I know how precious our children are. I met with @SBAList today to discuss the importance of protecting ALL lives.  ��
The opioid crisis is plaguing our country, our state, and our community. My district is the epicenter of this devastating epidemic and we must do everything we can to alleviate the impact. Watch our committee hearing here

During two separate hearings today I talked about the importance of clean energy, taking care of our veterans, and improving our infrastructure. It’s amazing what we can do when we focus on good governance instead of playing political games!
I appreciated @WestVirginiaAG    taking the time to stop in my office today to discuss how together we can work to keep improving WV!

See more information about how  #HR1 will waste your hard earned money on electing politicians you wouldn’t vote for below:
Instead of using tax-payer dollars to build our infrastructure, grow our economy, and improve transportation, Democrats want to create a fund to finance campaigns. They call H.R. 1 the “For the People Act” but it’s not for the people at all.
I am so excited about @facebook’s plan to provide 275-miles of fiber optic cable to connect our state. I met with their representatives to talk about improving our access to broadband. Thank you @SenCapito and @WVGovernor for all your hard work for WV!
I welcomed a group of future doctors to the US Capitol last night. It’s good to have a great set of doctors, especially @WVSOM doctors, on your side! If your group is interested in a group tour, please reach out to our office.
Last night I stopped into one of my favorites, Shonet’s Country Cafe in Milton. I enjoyed catching up with Mayor Canterbury and Joann!
The last stop on my tour today was a sneak peek of the Grand Patrician Resort in Milton. This hotel is bringing adequate lodging to our state, diversifying our economy through private investment, and building more infrastructure. I am excited to see it officially open!
Next stop ️ the Prichard Intermodal Facility in Wayne County. This facility is crucial to connecting our state. Thank you for letting me ride the Reach Stacker, that lifts train cars onto semi-trucks for their transportation!
This morning I toured the Neonatal Therapy Unit in Hoops Family Children’s Hospital at Cabell Huntington Hospital and spoke with women in the MOM’s program. Treatment and recovery for both infants and mothers is crucial and I appreciate them sharing their stories.
I was honored to attend the Community Leaders Prayer Breakfast this morning a pray for our country and for our state. Prayer is so powerful. Thank you to Pastor Mike Greider and Mission Tri-State for serving our community.
I have officially been promoted from a Major to a Lieutenant Colonel in the Civil Air Patrol Congressional Squadron. I am very impressed by these young cadets from the West Virginia Wing and their commitment to WV and to our country.

Imagine what we could have spent the day working on - job creation, career and technical education, or infrastructure.
Part 2/2
We should be spending our time solving the crisis on our border, diversifying our economy, and building our infrastructure, NOT playing political games. Part 1/2 of my questioning at @GOPoversight hearing today ️

It is important to remember that today coal is clean, affordable, dependable and allows our country to be self-reliant. Read my complete thoughts on the #GreenNewDisaster
In 2014, Pres. Obama requested funds for the “humanitarian crisis” at our border. Today, Democrats voted to terminate @POTUS’s emergency declaration on the same issue. They don’t care about finding solutions to our problems, only playing games. We need to secure our border!
The democrats #GreenNewDisaster is nothing more than a phony plan to reignite the war on coal @POTUS worked so hard to end. It kills coal, eliminates all diesel and gas powered vehicles, and ends air travel. WV and America deserves better than this!
I spoke to the WV @AmericanLegion today about important Veterans’ issues like mental health and access to good care treatment. I always enjoy it when they stop by the office to say hello to #MarshalltheBuffalo and I!
Stopped into a West Virginia favorite on the drive back to DC. The town of Thomas is such a neat place, if you haven’t been, grab a bite at the Purple Fiddle and listen to some live music!
Last night I met with some students at the @WVGovernor Mansion. We talked about economic development and job creation. These young people were inspirational and our future is looking bright!
Today I hosted a roundtable discussion at Princeton City Hall focusing on economic development in the region. Working together, we can unlock the great potential here!
Today I opened my district office in Beckley, WV along with the help of my friend #GeorgeTheBuffalo! We are here to work for you. Come stop by and say hi �
Today, we remember the brave soldiers who landed on Iwo Jima this day 74 years ago. I’m proud to call one of those heroes my friend, WV’s own @WoodyWilliams45, who received the Medal of Honor for his action. Watch the video below to hear his story. Thank you for your service!
This Presidents’ Day, we honor those who held the highest office in the land. Today, we remember the legacy of all our Presidents and thank them for shaping our country into the America we call home! @POTUS #PresidentsDay
West Virginia has been hit especially hard by illegal drugs smuggled across our southern border. Just two weeks ago, Customs and Border Protection seized enough fentanyl to kill every person in West Virginia 32 times over. If that’s not an emergency, then I don’t know what is.
Yesterday, Congress secured funding for 55 miles of border wall to be constructed where it is most desperately needed - but that doesn’t go far enough. We have a humanitarian and security emergency on our southern border, and our President is addressing that crisis.
My statement regarding the President’s Declaration for a National Emergency to address the security and humanitarian crisis at the Southern Border:
It was great meeting with you! Thank you for stopping by to discuss our common goals. #steel #trade #health
I am a wife, a mother, and a grandmother. I have felt life quicken in my womb and I know the blessing of children. This why I stand for life and demand protections for our youngest citizens. We must take care of our children! Listen to the rest of my speech here ️
Did you know that cardiovascular disease is the #1 cause of death for American women, and that every 80 seconds a woman loses her fight? This is why I joined other congressional women to #GoRedForWomen and raise my voice in support. #HeartMonth ️ @American_Heart
Great seeing some friends from back home today. Together we can grow our small businesses and diversify our economy. Thank you for all your hard work!
I am so excited about this plan between Apple and Dept. of VA. Our veterans put everything on the line for our country and it is our duty to take care of them back home. This will make healthcare so much easier for the 140,000 veterans in the 3rd
Happy Birthday @GenChuckYeager, 96 years young! Hope to see you back in Lincoln County soon! �
I was touched when @wvsosoffice surprised me in my office this afternoon. I worked with him during my days at the @wvhouse. Together, with #MarshallTheBuffalo, we are working to make our state bigger and better!
It was great to see @ChamberAlerts President Bill Bissett today. We spoke about creating jobs and making the most of our natural resources. I appreciate his advocacy and dedication to the people of Huntington and all of WV!
#GreenNewDisaster
Congratulations to White Sulphur Springs and thank you for all your hard work @SenCapito on the @US_EDA grant. WV has fought hard to grow our state and this award is key to unlocking our future!
Democrats claim the Green New Deal will help the future of our nation, but it will only end up hurting us. Did you know:   93% of WV electricity is generated by coal Over 30,000 are employed in the WV coal industry  Coal revenue provides billions to our state each year

Coal sure does keep the lights on, especially in a polar vortex! I toured AEP’s 1300 Megawat Mountaineer Plant in Mason County. They employ over 150 people and use 3-4 million tons of coal a year. #WVPowersTheNation

This morning the @HouseGOP  voted AGAIN to pay government workers including, @DHSgov, @CBP, @ICEgov, @USCG, and @TSA. Take a look all 214 Democrats who voted against this measure:
We are in day 34 of this shut down and Democrats have voted twice against paying furloughed federal workers. We need to secure our borders and take care of our workers at home.
We must hold everyone serving the taxpayers to the highest standards. I am honored to join with my colleagues @GOPoversight to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse.
