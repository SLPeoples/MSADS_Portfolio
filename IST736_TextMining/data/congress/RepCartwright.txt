RT @govtrack: H.R. 762 by @RepCartwright passed the House yesterday (→Senate). Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act of 2019
Last night, the House passed my bipartisan bill to help our nation’s schools become more energy efficient. Schools saving energy helps our taxpayers, our students and our planet. #ForThePeople
Too many schools today need vast improvements to meet their energy needs. That’s why I’m proud the House passed my Streamlining Energy Efficiency for Schools Act tonight, which will help schools find ways to cut energy costs and improve our children’s classrooms. #ForThePeople
Last year's election brought a record 131 women to the halls of Congress. Proud to stand with @HouseDemWomen as we celebrate this progress and continue fighting for equality and #ForThePeople. #WomensHistoryMonth

Happy Presidents’ Day, everyone. Have a look at this short editorial. It’s about HR 1, the #ForThePeople Act, authored by my good friend @RepSarbanes. Let’s protect the democracy Washington fought so hard to create, and Lincoln fought so hard to preserve.
As a senior member of @AppropsDems, I’m concerned about protecting the spending power of Congress. And as an American, I’m really concerned about the constitutionality of this kind of declaration, as it threatens one of the core pillars of our republic: the separation of powers.
The president's emergency declaration is not a smart move. Democrats and Republicans worked hard to reach a bipartisan deal to keep our government open, one that would strengthen and invest in border security in effective ways.
It's been one year since the #Parkland community said goodbye to 17 beautiful souls, whose lives were lost in a matter of minutes. Let's keep working to make sure these tragedies like these never happen again. #MSDStrong #NeverAgain

We all saw this coming when Republicans rammed through a huge tax cut for millionaires and billionaires. Now they target your Medicare and Social Security benefits as the way to pay for their ill-advised tax cuts for the
Rising costs in housing, specialty medical treatment and hospital services, and prescription medicines.I support adjusting the way Social Security COLAs are figured to better reflect rising prices in the areas of need and expense for seniors. #ExpandSocialSecurity.
Today’s Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement of 2.8% is welcome news to seniors who have seen their living and out-of-pocket medical expenses rise. But we need Social Security benefits to keep up with all the rising costs that hit seniors hard.

When you propose good legislation that will save lives money, like my #OrganDonor Clarification Act will, support comes in from all over. Here’s Republican former Speaker @newtgingrich with a strong endorsement of my bill:
Today’s deadline imposed by #China on US air carriers is an unnecessary provocation. The gov’t and people of #Taiwan should know that we stand with them as friends. 
The #AderholtAmendment is a thinly veiled #LicenseToDicriminate. The amendment would allow child welfare organizations to discriminate against #LGBT people, denying loving homes for children who need them most.
115,000 people await an organ transplant in America. My #OrganDonorClarificationAct will save lives and billions in Medicare costs. That’s why I have support from Rs Ds, orgs individuals, Nobel winner Al Roth conservative tax reformer @GroverNorquist
Nothing was more important to the development of the middle class than America's labor movement. After this week's #Janus decision undermined workers' rights, it's more important than ever that we give Americans #ABetterDeal.
#SCOTUS decision in #Janus was not jurisprudence, it was bare-knuckle politics. My bill protects collective bargaining rights for employees. Organized labor is a time-honored tradition in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act defends it #Union
The #SCOTUS #Janus decision is an outright attack on unions, an attack on working people the causes we fight for every day. We stand with our union brothers sisters. This decision will not stop our efforts.#UnionProud #UnionStrong
Three years ago marriage equality became the law of the land. Today we continue to push for progress and seek to end all remaining discrimination. #EqualityForward
