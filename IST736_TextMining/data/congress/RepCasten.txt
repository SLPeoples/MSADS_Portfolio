The CFPB was created to be critical protector of students who are swindled by loan companies. This week I pressed the agency’s leader to affirm that mission.
It's about time Congress addresses climate change and I'm proud to work with my colleagues in the House Majority to advance those priorities.
I have made it a priority to support and expand women’s rights and opportunities — by re-authorizing the Violence Against Women Act #VAWA and #PayCheckFairness Act. #InternationalWomensDay

In DuPage County, we saw voting issues firsthand – from faulty to broken machines to long wait lines - It’s time to modernize our election systems. Read my full statement on #HR1:
Today we delivered on our promise to pass #HR1 to: ️Get dark money out of politics ️Limit special interests’ influence ️Make elections clean and fair️Demand more of elected officialsI'm proud to work w/ my colleagues on this historic legislation #ForThePeople.
Heading to the Floor to vote for #HR1 #ForThePeople to modernize secure our election systems, get dark money out of politics, increase transparency. This isn’t a “power grab” - it’s about making sure that Washington works #ForThePeople. Now over to you, Senate.
I'm proud to co-sponsor the 2019 #VAWA Reauthorization Act.
From 2014 to 2016, #VAWA funded programs provided legal assistance to an average of 28,553 victims every 6 months. Let’s continue this service by reauthorizing #VAWA4ALL
Devastated to hear about the tragic passing of Deputy Jacob Keltner. My heart goes out to his family, friends, and the entire McHenry community at this difficult time. We are forever grateful for his service.

.@RepUnderwood I introduced the Taxpayer Extension Act to give American taxpayers an additional 5 weeks (equal amount of time as the #TrumpShutdown) to file their individual tax returns for 2018. During the shutdown, the IRS sent close to 90% of its workforce home without pay.
I am proud to serve on the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis where I believe we can help to do just that.
The President is fiddling while Rome burns.  It’s time Congress stood up, asserted itself and showed leadership in combatting the climate crisis.
As sea levels rise and historically damaging storms ravage our coastal communities, this Administration continues to roll back important protections to our environment.
200 million tons. 200 million tons of climate pollutants. A year. That is the high cost of this President’s careless climate policies.
Looking forward to voting to modernize secure our election systems by voting later this week to pass #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.
In the Financial Services Committee hearing last week, I questioned Federal Reserve Chair Powell about the continued harm climate change, specifically rising sea-levels, have on the housing market and if the agency has factored that into their reports.
This study shows one of the ways that the climate crisis is already impacting the lives of Americans across the country. Our inaction has a high cost that is growing daily. We must do more to protect our communities and transition to a net-zero emissions economy.

I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the #EmpowerAct, which takes on all types of harassment in the workplace by combating secrecy. It limits the use of mandatory NDAs that prevent people from speaking up and requires public companies to report info about harassment to the SEC.
#ICYMI: As Americans struggle with ever-increasing healthcare costs, I joined @RepGolden to introduce a bill last month to help address unfair price hikes for prescription drugs.
This is alarming. By rolling back coal ash regulations, the Trump EPA Administrator Wheeler have chosen to put the interests of corporate polluters ahead of our communities. Instead of weakening regulations, we should be working to make them better.

This is a blatant attack that prevents women from receiving necessary care. Our country should be expanding women’s access to reproductive and preventive healthcare, not taking it away.

The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency's issuance of a seal order has been a welcome action area residents are relieved that the seal order has been upheld in U.S. District Court. But I will continue to press for answers to ensure the safety well-being of the community.
That’s why I’ve joined my Illinois colleagues in pushing for two bills that would hold the @EPA accountable for its poor oversight of ethylene oxide emissions.
As more -- and apparently conflicting -- data is released, the more distressing and inadequate I find the @EPA ’s handling of emissions from the plant.
Even before I was elected to Congress, I was calling for swift, decisive action to address reports of elevated emissions at the Willowbrook Sterigenics plant.
Happy belated birthday to a dear colleague. Forever grateful for your leadership and service.

It is time to talk about sensible gun control, background checks, and assault weapons ban, because we don’t have any more time for thoughts and prayers.

Today I toured the Glen Ellyn civic center renovation and discussed economic opportunities for small businesses to succeed.
(5/5): During my committee hearing, I focused on domestic violence victims and homelessness to bring awareness to both issues.
Another senseless gun rampage. This one, apparently targeting coworkers -- in Aurora. My heart breaks. I stand ready to help victims and families and to fight for sensible gun laws.
The Constitution is clear. The power of the purse is vested in People’s representatives and no funds can be used from the Treasury without appropriations made by law. The Founding Fathers would be appalled by this President’s abuse of power.

(4/5): Judie is a survivor of domestic abuse and spoke to me about the negative consequences the government shutdown had on abuse survivors who depend on the Family Shelter Service.
(3/5): We are all too aware that women who are fleeing violence are at a disproportionate risk of homelessness. Recently, I hosted Judie Caribeaux, the Executive Director of the Family Shelter Service in DuPage County at the State of the Union.
(2/5): In 2018, it was reported that 106,871 women, 111,592 children, and 37,878 veterans are homeless.
(1/5): This week the Financial Services Committee held its first committee hearing – focusing on homelessness in America and solutions to end this problem that plagues our nation.
to his pet project – a proposal the Congress has just thoroughly rejected.  He is making a mockery of the Constitutional power of the purse that is vested in the Congress. It is beyond childish.  It is an absolute abuse of power and one the Congress must soundly reject.
I hope, begin to focus on the very real challenges facing our country.   The people have spoken through their directly elected representatives, but this President refuses to accept the verdict.  Instead, he plans to declare a national emergency to divert billions of dollars
But the fact that Congress would – after weeks of delay – finally stand up to an out-of-control Executive by exercising its Constitutional powers is little cause for celebration. Nevertheless, I am glad that this unnecessary shutdown drama has been put aside and we can,
Both Houses of Congress voted to keep the government open, ending a politically driven show-down that has been playing out since before I took the oath of office. It is a relief to families all across the country who felt the pain of the most recent shutdown...

I am confident that this Congress can find solutions that help limit emissions while promoting economic growth."I asked Dr. Mahowald, Faculty Director for the Environment @Cornell to further discuss these opportunities and the role this Congress should play.

We must demand accountability at the EPA and I will commit to do so in my oversight roles on the Science Committee and Select Committee on Climate Change.
In the longer term, it compromises the ability of the EPA to attract people to their agency who are motivated by the agencies mission. This ultimately destroys the consent of the governed upon which our country is based.
The EPA is staffed with lifetime public servants who are committed to their mission.  But at the leadership levels, we have a President and an EPA administrator who see their role as being to reduce the regulatory burden on polluters rather than protecting the environment.
In Willowbrook IL, residents are fearful of rising cancer risks from a local facility that is releasing ethylene oxide but EPA has been too slow to monitor, collect data and determine if further enforcement actions are required.
If this was because there were no causes for inspections or violations that would be great news. But that simply isn't the case. In Illinois, the Region 5 office staffing is down by over 10%, leaving fewer bodies to monitor much less determine who should be inspected.
The job of the @EPA is to protect the environment. Under the Trump administration, that increasingly isn't happening. As reported, EPA inspections are at a 10 year low.
I hope this is true because if this Congress fails, now, to keep the government operating, we will have proven just one thing: an aisle is a stronger barrier than a wall.
Our federal employees and contractors are not bargaining chips. We owe them and fortunately, we seem to be on the verge of passing a funding package to avert a looming second shutdown of 2019.

tangible measures to reduce the gun violence epidemic in this country; a commitment to women’s rights, including the right to choose and a push for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women’s Act.
I would have liked to have heard: a call for united action on climate change that includes real solutions like reducing CO2 emissions; a plan to repair the damage done in the last two years to the Affordable Care Act to ensure affordable, accessible health care for all;
I appreciate his rhetoric on reducing drug prices and his acknowledgement of strong female leadership in the house, but ultimately his remarks fell short of the kind of bipartisan unity that our nation needs.
I would have liked to have seen statesmanship and an end to the divisive rhetoric that has been a hallmark of his candidacy and his time in office. The President fell short. He could have demonstrated a willingness to solve problems that we all agree need to be addressed.

In addition to those subjects, I hope he will use this opportunity to address reducing the risk of climate change; push for common-sense gun safety legislation;
We need solutions, and I hope the President will take the opportunity provided by tonight’s address to put politics aside, end his divisive rhetoric, and demonstrate statesmanship to tackle these critical matters.
