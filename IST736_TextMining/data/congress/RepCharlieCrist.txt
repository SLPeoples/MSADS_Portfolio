Systemic failures at All Children's found by federal investigators. Long road ahead to restore trust in the institution by our community. Will be meeting with HHS officials next week to discuss.
We will continue working with neighboring countries to deliver much-needed humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan people.
The U.S. and international community recognize the legitimacy of Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s Interim President, and support the people of Venezuela in their effort to free themselves from Maduro’s dictatorship.
Time and time again, Maduro forces the Venezuelan people to pay the price, now depriving them of desperately needed food and medicine.
Violently blocking aid to ease the humanitarian crisis he created, Maduro’s latest moves to preserve his illegitimate dictatorship represent a new, detestable low.
Despite tremendous growth in #STEM careers, women only make up 13% of engineers in the work force. More important than ever to remove barriers for women in engineering and invest in our #STEMeducation  – introducing students through innovative early learning! #GirlDay2019

We must protect all God’s creatures, great and small! Preventing known animal abusers from breeding dogs is a no-brainer! @RepBrianFitz @RepMcGovern @CongressmanGT
Department of Defense MUST protect ALL military personnel who’ve dedicated their lives to defending our freedom. It’s the right thing to do – for our national defense and our American values.
Very honored to have Chris and Chelsey Gutierrez, from @USCG Clearwater, in DC tonight for the #SOTU — we must protect our military families from another harmful shutdown!
Congratulations to Mt. Moriah Christian Fundamental Academy on receiving @nehgov grant funding for “Revisiting the Founding Era” program through St. Petersburg Libraries – encouraging children to understand and engage with our Constitution!
Honored to have @USCG Air Station Clearwater family Chris and Chelsey Gutierrez as my guests at the #SOTU. Their story is a powerful illustration of the human impact of the #shutdown, and why we shouldn’t allow it to be repeated.

I look forward to discussing enhanced border security proposals in the coming weeks and will continue pressing for passage of legislation to fully fund our  government for the remainder of the fiscal year, preventing another shutdown.
I strongly support border security, but holding the federal government hostage to push a specific policy proposal was inappropriate and not how our democracy should work.
The shutdown was irresponsible, causing harm to millions of Americans in the public and private sectors, damaging our economy, and weakening our safety and security.
All @BankOfAmerica clients impacted by gov’t shutdown and in need of financial assistance can call (844) 219-0690 to learn more about their Client Assistance Program – click below to learn more. #EndTheShutdown

The National Weather Service has been facing a staff shortage. Now thousands of  @NWS employees that help keep our communities safe from extreme weather storms are working 24/7 without pay. This is not sustainable, and it is not right. #EndTheShutdown
VA appeals reform promises to reduce backlog, speed up decisions for our veterans. We’ll be monitoring closely, but optimistic that this new process, stemming from legislation we passed last year, will be an improvement.
Florida families demand we #ActOnClimate – protecting the environment and their wallets. Less carbon + monthly check $ to every American = win-win #ForThePeople!

Keeping our promise to our seniors, fighting #ForThePeople!
Standing with @TSA, @NATCA, and @AFGENational employees at      @FlyTPA who are working without pay during the #shutdown. For them and their families, this is a crisis. It’s past time to do the right thing for      hardworking American families. #EndtheShutdown
LIVE @FlyTPA with @USRepKCastor @AFGENational discussing how the #shutdown is hurting local workers. Tune in

Grateful for the work being done through @JWBPinellas to help struggling families during #shutdown crisis – and every day of the year.
The shutdown is harming @NOAA’s efforts to track and help deal with harmful algal blooms like #RedTide. One more reason we need to re-open government before more damage is done to our state.
Federal employees and others impacted by the government shutdown can dial 2-1-1 to speak with a @UnitedWay @211tbc specialist and find out what assistance may be available. Visit the website ↓ for more info.

Praying for a swift and full recovery for my friend and colleague @RepHastingsFL. One of the strongest fighters I know!
SCAM ALERT: @MyFDOT issues warning on fraudulent SunPass invoices being sent via email – click the link below for info on what to look out for.
Affected federal workers are eligible to apply for unemployment benefits to help stay afloat until the government re-opens. These benefits would  need to be re-paid after the shutdown ends, if back pay is received.  Learn more and apply here:
The partial shutdown is now in its 3rd week, the longest in history. Affected federal employees will miss a paycheck today. For families on a tight budget, with a mortgage, car payments, daycare…it’s a crisis.
The shutdown is causing real pain and uncertainty for thousands of families who will miss a paycheck today. Just voted to guarantee ALL federal workers receive back pay ASAP when the government re-opens.
Diverting disaster funding to the border wall is unacceptable. Floridians, Puerto Ricans, Texans Californians continue to struggle in the wake of recent disasters. This move would punish them further. We need to re-open government and get back to the peoples’ business.
Honored to be joining @AppropsDems. Fighting #ForThePeople – to combat #climatechange, protect clean air water, provide for a strong national defense, support our veterans, build better roads bridges, and strengthen programs for those struggling to make ends meet!

Wonderful work being done at @Lighthouse_LHP – helping folks in Pinellas with vision impairment live safe, healthy, and independent lives!
Floridians acted decisively and clearly to amend our state Constitution, restoring the voting rights for 1.7 million of our neighbors. Tactics of delay and confusion should be rejected. The people – our bosses – have spoken. Amendment 4 goes into effect on January 8th.
No place better to discuss the impact of #climatechange than Tampa Bay. @USRepKCastor and I invited the UN to host major 2019 Conference in our community.

Wise words from a man that understood the importance of showing kindness and compassion to others, even during times of division.

Introduced bipartisan carbon fee bill this week to cut carbon emissions return revenue to American households in a monthly check – putting a #PriceOnPollution ! #ClimateFriday
Pinellas families depend on the #NFIP before, during, and after storms, providing peace of mind that their home will be covered if disaster strikes. Congress must #reauthorizeNFIP to protect Florida communities!
Local leaders share views on @usfsp consolidation – goal is to strengthen the university our community.
#NFIP doesn’t just protect homes, businesses also depend on this program for coverage. We must #reauthorizeNFIP now to protect Pinellas #smallbiz!
Troubling report by the @TB_Times – the families, and our community, demand answers.
Putting a #PriceOnPollution is key to combating #climatechange. Our bipartisan bill takes historic steps towards a greener cleaner economy, AND uses the revenue to cut a monthly check to every American!
Our bipartisan carbon fee bill takes historic steps toward reducing carbon dependency – key to addressing climate crisis – while using the revenue generated to cut a monthly check to every American. A win-win solution!

We’re unveiling historic, bipartisan carbon fee legislation needed to fight climate change – tune in now!
Families fleeing violence and persecution have traveled thousands of miles to legally apply for asylum. Women and young children were met with tear gas. It’s inhumane, un-American, and unacceptable.
