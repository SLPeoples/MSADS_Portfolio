At the Dollar General today in Hampton for a Supermarket Saturday where folks told me Congress needs to get results for the American people. That’s why I helped pass the #ForThePeople Act yesterday to clean up the culture of corruption in Washington.
I’m so proud of my good friend @RepKatiePorter — she’s courageous and inspiring. It’s essential we reauthorize #VAWA.

Happy #InternationalWomensDay! Today I’m thinking of all the extraordinary women who paved the way and made it possible to have 106 women serve in the House. Let’s keep going!
Took to the House floor today to talk about how the #ForThePeople Act @HouseDemocrats will make it easier to vote, protect the integrity of our elections ban members of Congress from serving on corporate boards.
Up next with @HallieJackson to discuss #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. Tune in to @MSNBC!
As the wife of a sheriff, I know today is the nightmare any family of a law enforcement officer fears the call one prays they never have to pick up. Law enforcement officers put their lives on the line every day I want to thank the first responders who were at the scene.
My heart aches for the McHenry County Sheriff’s deputy who was shot and killed this morning – and I join the community of Rockford and all Americans to pray for him and his family.
Closely following this – my heart goes out to the people of Rockford the first responders on the scene. Prayers for the officer who was shot. Please follow @RockfordPD’s instructions to stay safe, vigilant avoid the area—suspect is reportedly armed fled the scene.

Today in @AppropsDems Military Construction-VA Subcommittee I asked @DeptVetAffairs Sec. Wilkie about transportation concerns of veterans in rural areas. Our veterans have made so many sacrifices defending our freedom deserve nothing but the best care.
Thank you to @ILfoodbank for taking the time to meet today. Keep up all of the great work you do to feed the hungry in our community and across Illinois.
It was great to welcome @GovPritzker to Washington last night with the rest of the Illinois Congressional Delegation! Our region faces real challenges but I have so much hope for our future. Excited for the possibilities to work together!
Thanks for taking the time to chat, @WKEIRegionalDN! Enjoyed seeing your wonderful new facility in Kewanee.
As we continue to celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, we must recognize the history that's been made right here at home. Charles Box served as the first African-American mayor of Rockford, IL and was committed to improving the community through public service.
I hope everyone enjoyed FFA week! Agriculture plays such an important role in our region and it's crucial we provide our future ag leaders with the tools, knowledge and skills they need to succeed.
Fun fact from my Cheri on Shift @McDonalds today: The Quad Cities restaurants sell the most McRibs in the U.S. I had a blast getting behind the counter today to work the grill and drive-thru!
Thanks to everyone who took the time to share what’s on your mind with me at the Save-A-Lot in Kewanee. I’m proud to be your voice in Washington and focus on the kitchen table issues important to our region.
As a member of @HouseAgDems since I first came to Congress, I’m proud to have partners like the Henry County Farm Bureau. Producers and farmers across our region drive our local economy and it was great to sit around the table and discuss the issues with them today.
Took to the Mississippi River for my Cheri on Shift today with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers where I helped with the maintenance process on a dewatered lock. Investing in our infrastructure remains one of my top priorities this Congress.
Earlier today I toured the National Guard Armory in Milan. As a member of @AppropsDems Subcommittee on Defense, I’ll work to ensure our region’s defense priorities are addressed and our nation’s military remains strong. Thanks for showing me around!
Important step forward for workers who too often are silenced through forced arbitration. Now we need legislative action to end this practice and give a voice to women and workers who experience discrimination and harassment in the workplace.

Put simply, leaders don’t just shut down the government or declare a national emergency any time they disagree with Congress.
And while I’m encouraged Congress was able to come together, I’m concerned w/ POTUS' reported plans to declare a national emergency to build an ineffective, costly border wall he said Mexico would pay for. He's breaking a signature promise he’s setting a dangerous precedent.
Today’s bipartisan agreement achieves two important goals – it keeps our government open and takes critical, effective steps to secure our borders. While the bill isn’t perfect, both sides had to meet in the middle and that’s how governing ought to work. It's what folks expect.
Farmer bankruptcies are the highest they've been in at least a decade. Where I come from, President Trump's trade war is the real national emergency. Watch more on @MeetThePress:

As we celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, we honor those who made lasting impacts on our country and in our communities. Black history is American history – so check back throughout the month to celebrate some outstanding leaders from right here in our region of Illinois.
Thrilled to continue to serve on @HouseAgDems! Agriculture is the number one driver of Illinois’ economy I’m looking forward to what we can accomplish this Congress.
This morning we covered quality of life in the military at my first hearing on the @AppropsDems Military Construction-VA Subcommittee. In this role, I’ll work to ensure our service members, past and present, are taken care of and have access to the resources they need.
Today was our first Labor-HHS-Education subcommittee hearing. While the White House is in court to strike down patient protections for folks w/ pre-existing conditions, @AppropsDems are committed to protecting and improving their health care. #ProtectOurCare
The @ruralhealth association does outstanding work to ensure our rural communities have access to the care they need. Discussed this w/ Genesis Medical Center from Aledo today it will remain a top priority of mine this Congress!
I had a productive conversation today with @ChamberQC and appreciate them stopping by! It was great to discuss economic opportunities in the region and I look forward to our continued work to ensure we have a strong local economy.
The American people sent us here to govern w/ a purpose – not to bicker, but to solve problems. I’ll continue working w/ anyone on either side of the aisle to bring down the cost of health care, to invest in our infrastructure to clean up the corruption in D.C. #ForThePeople
The president spoke at length about bridging divides and healing wounds. I hope these weren’t just lines in a speech – but that he will stick to his word to find common ground and avoid another government shutdown in the coming weeks. #SOTU
And people with pre-existing conditions cannot ‘choose greatness’ when Washington Republicans continue working to rip away their critical patient protections. #ProtectOurCare #SOTU
However, the families we serve deserve real solutions – not just soundbites. Farmers cannot ‘choose greatness’ when the president’s #tradewar is eliminating the very markets where they need to sell their goods. #SOTU
I’m also hopeful we can work together to bring down the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and families and, as the president proposed, make meaningful investments to fight conditions such as childhood cancer. #SOTU
Pleased tonight’s #SOTU included a commitment to invest in our infrastructure. I’ve worked to bring both parties together on this issue – and @HouseDemocrats are ready w/ a trillion-dollar plan to create jobs rebuild our crumbling roads, bridges, hospitals, and locks and dams.
RT @voxdotcom: Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-IL) is bringing a farmer from Trump country to the #SOTU address to send the president a clear message:…
RT @benthomaspayne: I asked Mueller—who grows corn, soybeans, and hay, and who raises beef cattle on 750 acres—how his opinion of Trump has…
Thanks for chatting #SOTU w/ us. Farmers like Tom are navigating a tough farm economy – and this trade war is making it worse. POTUS’ theme tonight is “choosing greatness,” but farmers can’t choose greatness if they don’t have markets to sell their goods.
I had a blast introducing my #SOTU guest, Tom, to @SenatorDurbin and the rest of the stellar Illinois Delegation this evening. Thanks for having us – we’re ready for the speech!
Proud to stand with my colleagues as we wear suffragette white today to the #SOTU. With a record number of @HouseDemWomen serving this Congress, we’re ready to get to work #ForThePeople again!
It was great to meet with the president of @Augustana_IL today to discuss the importance of higher education. I’ll continue working to make sure institutions have the resources they need to make college more affordable for students in our region.
Because it's people like Tom who put food on the plates of families across our nation and world. I'll continue to fight to ensure our family farmers have the resources, tools certainty they need to succeed. I'm grateful Tom shared his story and is with me here today. [END]
That's just not right. Instead, we should be fighting for policies that open markets for our farmers and reward their hard work – not hinder it. As a member of @HouseAgDems since I first came to Congress, I've always been a strong voice for our family farmers.
Soybean farmers across Illinois have felt the impacts of this trade war on their bottom lines. Tom said it best when he stated, “the reckless trade policies coming from the White House seriously threaten the future of family farms like mine.”
[THREAD] Today is the #SOTU and I’m so glad to have Tom Mueller as my guest. Tom is a third-generation family farmer like so many producers across our region, he's concerned about the economic impact of @realDonaldTrump's trade war.
.@POTUS’ trade war has been a gut-punch for farmers like Tom. Instead of opening trade markets, he’s closing them. Instead of building trade allies, he’s alienating them. We need stability sensible trade policies – but all farmers have gotten from the White House is chaos #SOTU
Ms. Barnes’ 2nd grade class has a message for you! Don’t forget to submit your handmade Valentine’s Day cards for local veterans by this Friday to one of my Illinois offices:
Can’t underscore how vital local news is to our communities. I know this as a former newspaper reporter. We should do everything we can to support their efforts to keep our communities informed and to hold the powerful accountable. 
I always love walking the supermarket aisles to hear what’s on the minds of hardworking families across Illinois. I look forward to bringing the concerns I heard at Morrison’s Market in Viola back with me to Washington.
As Americans, we must come together to reject racism and prejudice. Our leaders should be held to the highest standard in this regard. The photo we saw today was reprehensible and Gov. Northam must resign.
2,150 – that’s how many books we’ve delivered to libraries across our region. Thanks to the Warren County Public Library for letting me stop by today on our @librarycongress Book Delivery Tour!
I had a blast making Valentine’s Day cards today with Ms. Barnes’ 2nd grade class! My sixth annual “Valentines for Veterans” program is off to a great start and I can’t wait to see all of the cards being made to show local veterans our appreciation. Thanks for having me!
The River Bend Foodbank serves so many across our region and today I paid them a visit to hear the impact the government shutdown had on their services. So grateful for their work to care for families in our community.
Without Kylie, this wouldn’t have been possible, and I thank her for her willingness to tell her story. Because of her, nobody will have to go through the same experience she did. 5/5 [END]
She was then confronted with costly lease cancellation fees that no family in that situation should face. This legislation fixes this issue and protects Gold Star families by allowing them to terminate residential leases w/o penalty in the wake of a service member’s death. 4/5
When I called to give Kylie the news, she told me a heartbreaking story. After her husband's passing, Kylie chose to bring her family back to Illinois from Texas, where he was stationed, to be with the rest of their loved ones. 3/5
Kylie’s husband, Sgt. Douglas J. Riney, made the ultimate sacrifice while defending our freedom in Afghanistan in 2016. The Fairview Post Office has since been dedicated to honor his life and bears his name today – after I passed legislation to do so. 2/5

I’m proud to help introduce the #PaycheckFairnessAct with @rosadelauro @HouseDemocrats to help close the wage gap and ensure women receive equal pay for equal work. This is an economic issue for women and families across our region – let’s get it done!
As a proud graduate of the University of Illinois system, I’m pleased to see them make this announcement. It’s important that Illinoisans have the opportunity to be educated right here at home and gain the skills needed to go on and join the workforce.
To our farmers and everyone else braving these tough conditions to get the job done, we are thinking of you and please stay safe!
Today was my first day as a member of @AppropsDems! I’d like to congratulate my friend @NitaLowey on becoming the first woman to chair this committee. Ready to make sure the needs of our region are being met, whether that's investments in our infrastructure or rural hospitals.
My friend @RepGwenMoore displayed incredible strength today by sharing her story. She’s not alone – we must continue the fight to improve our health care system and protect care for people w/ pre-existing conditions.
Couldn’t agree more. Thank you for leading the charge, @RepSpeier. Women should have equal opportunities—no matter the setting. Let’s get it done! #ERANow
As extreme weather conditions sweep through our region and state, please take all of the proper precautions and stay safe! Take a look at this important thread from @GovPritzker �
Shutting down the government is simply no way to govern and it is my hope that this report makes that clear. Constant threats to shut down the government must end so we can instead focus on policies that grow our economy help families succeed. 
Folks want us to work together and get something done. Enough partisan fighting. That’s what I heard at today’s #SupermarketSaturday in Moline. Ready to focus on the kitchen table issues families care about.
One of my favorite parts of this job is nominating students to our United States Service Academies. Thanks to our panelists who made the selections. Enjoyed meeting the students and their families today!
Stopped at the Cambridge Public Library to donate books from the @librarycongress — our 41st book drop so far!
My statement on the short-term deal to #EndTheShutdown.
Also stopped by Casey's heard about their decrease in business because of the shutdown. In a town w/ fewer than 600 people, this can hurt the economy. Pleased by the temporary solution – but we need to provide a permanent solution that brings an end to shutdown hostage taking.
Was in Thomson today hearing from workers about the shutdown and the financial strain it's causing for their families. These stories are nothing short of heartbreaking. Nobody should have to work without pay.

Just spoke w/ @kwqcnews about my efforts to open the govt, #EndTheShutdown and keep communities safe. There’s a real human cost to this crisis—hardworking men and women shouldn’t be missing paychecks while Congress has policy negotiations.
Thanks, Phil, for showing me around the 28th annual Quad Cities farm equipment show yesterday. I had a great time speaking with farmers and vendors from across the region. Despite being faced with a tough agriculture economy, it’s amazing to see all the great work taking place!
Had lunch with the Carroll County Farm Bureau yesterday. Despite passing a #FarmBill that provides our farmers with the support they need, the shutdown has made implementation impossible. We must #EndTheShutdown so farmers can get the support during this tough farm economy.
This government shutdown is making our communities less safe as TSA border patrol work w/o pay. I've voted to #EndTheShutdown 9 times now, along with effective measures to secure our borders. Read more about my efforts in the @qctimes�
Today I celebrated the life and legacy of #DrMartinLutherKingJr. with the Rockford community. I hope this celebration of his life reminds us that together we can overcome any challenges, because “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice”.
On #MartinLutherKingJrDay we honor a man who put his faith into action and organized with a message of hope, love brotherhood. Although we still have a lot of work ahead to realize his dream, he taught us that when we unite under a banner of peace, we can change the world.
Nobody should have to work w/o pay—but that’s what’s happening for TSA workers at Rockford’s airport due to this shutdown. It’s wrong and it’s hurting families. #EndTheShutdown
Stopped at a supermarket in Rockford today. Folks are ready to #EndTheShutdown so we can make progress on the kitchen table issues they care about—bringing down the cost of health care and investing in our infrastructure.
RT @FLYPIA: Thank you @RepCheri for your support!
But because of the shutdown, the USDA program they planned to use to make this expansion has been put on hold. I’ve voted 9 times to #EndTheShutdown — time for Mitch McConnell to take up our bills and open the government.
Today I visited Hammond-Henry Hospital in Geneseo to see how loans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's rural development program will allow them to update their facilities to provide even better care for their patients.
This week, I received a note from Ray in Knoxville, IL that truly shines a light on how the shutdown is hurting brave men and women who’ve put their life on the line for our country. POTUS @senatemajldr McConnell can take up our bills to #EndTheShutdown now!
�� that’s absolutely right. This assignment to the Appropriations Committee is a win for our region and a win for Illinois. Ready to get to work!
I’ll work tirelessly to make sure our region gets its fair share and that communities across our region have a strong voice at the table.
After being appointed to @AppropsDems’ subcommittees on Defense; Labor, Health Human Services, Education;  Mil. Con. and Vets Affairs, I'm better positioned to fight for our regions defense priorities, veterans who’ve served Illinoisans trying to make ends meet.
Since I was elected to office, I promised families across Central Northwest Illinois that I would be their voice in Washington.
Thank you, Chairwoman @NitaLowey! Ready to hit the ground running and go to bat for NW Central Illinois as a member of the Appropriations Committee.
This shutdown might be a stubborn game of chicken for the White House, but hardworking families across our region know that this is no way to govern – we must put the shutdown to an end. #EndTheShutdown #TrumpShutdown
And by prolonging this shutdown and rejecting bill after bill to fund our government, the president is making us less safe by not paying our border patrol and TSA agents.
This weekend, I spoke with a TSA agent who has no other choice but to dip into her wedding savings to make ends meet. She deserves better than this!
People in Illinois are hurting because of the shutdown – farmers are facing more uncertainty without the trade assistance they were promised by POTUS and too many Illinoisans aren’t getting their paychecks in the mail.
#TrumpShutdown thread → This month, @HouseDemocrats have voted for 7 different funding bills to keep folks safe, end the shutdown reopen our govt. Despite previous broad bipartisan support, Mitch McConnell the WH are holding these bills hostage to score political points.
This unnecessary shutdown has created hardship for too many families, and we owe it to the American people to do everything we can to mitigate the damage and #EndTheShutdown.
More than 7,000 federal workers across IL don’t know how they’re going to pay rent or put food on the table, let alone make student loan payments. That's why I joined @RepBonamici called on @BetsyDeVos to help student loan borrowers hurt by the #TrumpShutdown.
With the passage of this bill, all American flags purchased with taxpayer money will be American-made to ensure that the symbol of our nation is preserved while supporting American jobs and manufacturing. Hopeful the Senate will move on this bill get it to POTUS' desk.
He informed me that the American flag in the corner of the room could have been made overseas, and that he went into the service to fight for the USA, not China. Since that conversation, I have worked across the aisle to require the DOD to purchase American-made flags.
Today, the House passed my bipartisan bill that requires all American flags purchased by the federal government to be made in the U.S. from materials grown or produced in our country. This idea came from a Vietnam veteran in Moline.
Edward wrote how hard the shutdown has been on agriculture. Our ag producers already face a tough farm economy – and w/ POTUS’ trade war it’s only gotten worse. This shutdown is causing even MORE uncertainty. Time to end the #TrumpShutdown.
Last week, I reached out to the hardworking men and women across #IL17 to hear the impact of the govt. shutdown. Many of you wrote to me sharing the heartbreaking truth about what happens when you put politics over people.
Thanks to the @Dispatch_Argus for the kind words – we've got to invest in our infrastructure, hospitals and rural communities. Looking forward to fighting for our region as a member of the @AppropsDems! 
Such a cool project by the @nytimes. Looking forward to serving with a record number of women in the 116th Congress!
I went to the Moline airport to hear directly from the TSA Airport Director Agents that have been working to keep us safe, despite working without pay since the President shutdown the government. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown.
The lives of far too many across our region have been impacted by the #TrumpShutdown – time to open the govt. so the Ag Lab can continue advancing research that drives American agriculture and our economy.
This morning I took to the House floor to the recognize ground-breaking research at the Peoria Ag Lab, which has been brought to a grinding halt as a result of the #TrumpShutdown.
POTUS promised Mexico would pay for his wall. Now he’s trying a bait-and-switch on the American taxpayer. We can’t let that happen.
About to head on @hardball to discuss  how I’m working #ForThePeople impacted by the destructive #TrumpShutdown. We need to end this now. Tune in!

With this committee assignment, I plan to help cut through red tape, rein in wasteful spending and make government work for the people of our region again. Read more below:
To renew the promise of our region, one of my top priorities will be major investments in our infrastructure. We also need to work harder to meet the needs of rural hospitals that provide critical care while funding ag. priorities like the research at the Peoria Agriculture Lab.
Today, I am pleased to announce that I was appointed to serve on the House Appropriations Committee, which will allow me to better advocate for Illinois families– ensuring the needs of our region are being met and properly funded by the federal government.
It looks like I’ll be seeing another friendly face when I’m in Washington. Congratulations  to Rock Island native, Chasson Randle, for signing with the Washington Wizards! �
Whether it’s a mother that survived cancer or a child that has asthma – they shouldn’t be discriminated against or priced out of the insurance market. I’ll continue working to defend and improve health care for families in our
Folks from every corner of the district have reached out to share their deep concerns over partisan attacks on affordable health care, which is why I helped pass legislation today to protect Illinoisans with pre-existing conditions.
I will continue putting our families first and work with anyone, and everyone, willing to put this shutdown to an end.
Today I voted to fund the Department of Treasury and the IRS to ensure that Illinoisans receive their tax returns on time, so that small businesses can get the support they need to grow our local economy and to ensure consumer protections can be carried out.
Illinois families sent me to Washington to fight for them, and it is my job to ensure that their financial security does not fall victim to President Trump’s reckless shutdown.
On #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay, I want to recognize the brave men and women who work tirelessly to keep our communities safe. A very special thank you to my husband, Gerry, who has served the Quad-Cities for more than 3 decades. You make me so proud.
I had such a fun time this afternoon speaking with over 60 college women interested in pursuing careers in public service- including 4 from our very own @Augustana_IL! It is inspiring to meet so many young people looking to make a difference in their communities.
While the White House has threatened to keep the government shut down for ‘years,’ I’ll work with anyone to end this reckless shutdown and honor our commitment to keep communities safe. #TrumpShutdown
