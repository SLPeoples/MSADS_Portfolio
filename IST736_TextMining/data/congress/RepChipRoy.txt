Today, I met with the @TxDPS Director Steve McCraw to listen to the state's border security concerns.
Other notable benefits: - Supports efforts to curb both foreign and domestic terrorism financing  - Stigmatizes and isolates FTOs - Deters economic transactions to FTOs- Increases much needed public awareness and knowledge of FTOs- Signals our concern to other governments
Why do this? -To make it unlawful for those providing “material support or resources” to these cartels from entering the U.S. -To prevent these cartel members from entering the U.S. -Allow @stevemnuchin1 to block cartel assets
Why does it matter? 1) They terrorize through fear, violence, and murder in order to control the government, manipulate media, and bend society to their will.2) They have operation control of our border, which endangers the U.S., Mexico, the migrants who seek to come here.
Why do these specific cartels qualify as a Foreign Terrorist Organizations? They:- are a foreign organization. - meet the definition of ‘terrorism’ and engage in terrorist activity as defined by (22 U.S.C. § 2656f(d)(2)) and (8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(B)) of the U.S. code.
