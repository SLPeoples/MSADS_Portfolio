Our politics doesn't work when big money interests and politicians have all the power. #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, will reverse that trend so we can begin to tackle the big issues we were sent here to solve - issues like climate change, student debt, health care, many more.
Our VA policies should be rooted in a commitment to deliver quality care to our veterans that honors their service and sacrifice. As Chair of the VA Oversight Subcommittee, I believe we must ensure no undue influence over the VA from outside actors, including Mar-a-Lago members.
Today I proudly cast my vote in favor of #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. This bill will restore faith in our democracy allow us to refocus on important issues by fixing our broken campaign finance system, ending the culture of corruption in Washington, making it easier to vote.
On #InternationalWomensDay we resolve to advance the rights of women here at home and across the globe. I'm proud to be part of New Hampshire's all-feminist delegation fighting to advance gender equality every day in Congress.
New Hampshire is so proud of Exeter's own Dejah Rondeau her story which is featured on @adidas's #SheBreaksBarriers campaign for #InternationalWomensDay.

Current pharmaceutical marketing practices are unacceptable, and it’s something I hear about every day I’m out in the district talking to constituents. Thank you @SenatorHassan for taking a strong stand at yesterday’s Senate Finance Committee hearing.
I voted to protect the separation of powers prevent the President from violating the constitution in making his emergency declaration. We have too many real crises to justify a manufactured one, especially when it means upending our system hurting crucial funding elsewhere.
The House and Senate must act in a bipartisan fashion to stop President Trump’s unconstitutional emergency declaration. We cannot allow our democracy to be undermined so he can build the border wall that the American people and Congress refuse to support.
Today I was proud to join House members in co-sponsoring #VRAA, a bill to fully restore the 1965 Voting Rights Act. I support the bill because it would strengthen key protections and help secure the fundamental right to vote. #RestoreTheVote

I urge the President to exercise caution, skepticism, and restraint in this week's meeting with Kim Jong Un. No American president should "see eye-to-eye" with a brutal dictator like him.

Wow! Thanks to the 78 Raymond High School students for stepping up to raise this money for Special Olympics New Hampshire athletes. A tremendous accomplishment for a great cause.
I've co-sponsored legislation to stop President Trump from making an end run around Congress with his national emergency declaration. The President’s power grab is unconstitutional, and we need leaders from both parties to say so.

This morning I met with New Hampshire's Special Olympics delegation, including Kelsey Hannah from Alvirne HS. We discussed the outstanding work they're doing in unified programs to support students with disabilities.
NH should be a leader on clean energy. Instead we've lost solar jobs for 2 straight years because of President Trump's misguided tariffs lack of state support. Renewables are a win for our environment economy, and it's time to step up our investments.
2 more days to get your #ValentinesForVets in. You can drop them off at my office (660 Central Ave in Dover) or @MayorJoyceCraig's office (1 City Hall Plaza in Manchester). Let's show New Hampshire veterans how much we appreciate their service to our country.
No deal will be perfect, but it's a healthy sign that House Senate members from both parties are working to craft a compromise. This is how democracy is supposed to work. Shutting down the govt never will be an acceptable strategy for getting your way.
We're inviting everyone to join @MayorJoyceCraig me by making Valentines Day cards to give to our veterans. You can drop off your valentines @ 1 City Hall Plaza in Manchester or 660 Central Ave in Dover before Feb 14th. We’ll be delivering them to the #MHT VA on Valentines Day.

But we should be clear that any future threat of a shutdown has no place in the dialogue of how to keep this country safe or pass comprehensive immigration reform. No President or leader in Congress should ever use federal workers and critical services as political leverage. 4/6
The President showed why shutting down the government is never a responsible strategy. Our democratic process is the way we must work out our differences. I'm eager to be a part of good faith discussions about investing in effective, evidence-based border security proposals. 3/6
I’m looking forward to getting to work on matters critical to the people of New Hampshire with the government fully open for business. 2/6
This agreement is long-overdue an enormous relief to the 800,000 federal employees who have gone 35 days without pay. The past 5 weeks have paralyzed critical govt functions cut services. The shutdown was a pointless exercise that didn’t change a thing. Full statement: 1/6

This shutdown has forced federal employees to go 35 days without a paycheck, making it harder for families to pay their bills on time through no fault of their own. We're asking credit agencies to prevent late payments from hurting federal workers' credit score. #EndTheShutdown

You’ve worked 5 weeks today you got a 2nd paystub showing $0 earned. Meanwhile politicians Admin billionaires don’t understand the urgency keep playing political games.This is the treatment 800,000 workers are receiving on #Day35. We owe it to them to #EndTheShutdown now.

Today was the first meeting with my colleagues on @TransportDems. Repairing our crumbling roads bridges is essential for our public safety developing our economy. That’s why it’s imperative to #EndTheShutdown, pay our federal workers get back to our nation’s work.
I stopped by @WCKitchen #ChefsForFeds to help @chefjoseandres his team serve lunch to federal workers impacted by this govt shutdown. It’s amazing to see this kind of generosity, but heartbreaking how many hardworking Americans are suffering because of Washington dysfunction.
Glad to see this helping hand for @USCG families struggling through the shutdown. They dutifully serve us deserve our support. Thanks to @GatherNH for coming through in this time of need.

It's #Day34. Tomorrow 800,000 federal employees will miss their second paycheck. What is it going to take for the President and Senator McConnell to do the right thing? Let's stop the political brinksmanship, put people before politics, and #EndTheShutdown now.
Today the Senate is slated to vote on a bipartisan bill to re-open govt at funding levels they supported in Dec. That bill already passed the House, I'm hopeful Sen. Republicans will listen to constituents have the courage to send the bill to @POTUS’s desk #EndTheShutdown.
New Hampshire families shouldn't have to suffer because of Washington dysfunction. That's why I voted to #EndTheShutdown for the 10th time today increase border security by $1.6 billion. It’s time for Senate Republicans to re-open our government allow us to get back to work.
Today I voted for the 10th time to re-open the government, including $1.6 for border security. We should debate immigration reform, but we can’t do it with the government closed. 800,000 workers are not a political bargaining chip. #EndTheShutdown
Today is #Day33 of the longest government shutdown in American history. On Friday, more than 800,000 Americans will miss their 2nd paycheck. The government should never be shut down for policy disagreements. We need to #EndTheShutdown get to the important business ahead of us.
Hey @RepPressley, I’ve got your back. And since we’re the New England Patriots, I know @RepLoriTrahan, @RepJahanaHayes, @RepGolden will, too. @RepKatieHill, don’t bet against the @Patriots! #GOAT � #EverythingWeGot
Today is #Day32 of the shutdown, and we must continue to press the Senate leadership to take up the bipartisan govt funding bills. We can have a robust discussion about immigration 21st century border security once services are restored and 800,000 workers get their paychecks.
This ban makes our country less safe and politicizes our military. The Court’s ruling is a sobering reminder of the work ahead of us to protect LGBTQ rights. 2/2
Today’s action by the Supreme Court to allow the Trump Administration to ban transgender service members while a lower court case proceeds is a blow to the equality dignity of thousands of transgender troops. 1/2
46 years ago, the Supreme Court's landmark decision Roe v. Wade affirmed a woman’s right to choose. We must keep fighting for reproductive freedom and access to health services at a time when so many politicians are working to restrict them. #FightForRoe #Roe46
This afternoon I joined members of the community at Temple Adath Yeshurun to remember the life struggle of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. He blazed a trail toward justice equality, and his life should continue to inspire us to create a more perfect union. #MLKDay
Today is #Day31 of the shutdown. On #MLKDay we ought to remember that it's never the most well-off well-connected who suffer the worst consequences of political dysfunction. The shutdown is hurting millions of families for no reason, we must swiftly end it by reopening govt.
It was inspiring to join @CityYearNH this morning at Hillside Middle School in Manchester to celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Every day, City Year Americorps members are answering Dr. King's call to look out for others and serve the greater good. #MLKDay
Dr. King taught us not to be bystanders but to be actively engaged in the life of our community. He showed us that even against great odds—even when the deck has been stacked—we can be catalysts for meaningful change. #MLKDay
The �delivers again!! It wouldn’t be #SuperBowlLIII without the @patriots. #EVERYTHINGWEGOT
