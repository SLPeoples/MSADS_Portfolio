I voted for this watered down resolution condemning all hate. But the remarks by their members deserve to be specifically called out voted on.

If you support #HR1, you support: A 6:1 government match to any small donor contributions of $200 or less in a Congressional or Presidential campaign. Meaning, for every $200 donated, the federal government will use hard-earned taxpayer dollars to match $1,200.
If you support #HR1, you support: An inappropriate use of federal workers and taxpayer dollars by granting federal employees 6 days of paid vacation to serve as poll watchers.
If you support #HR1, you support: Changing the make up of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) from a balanced 3-3 ratio to a partisan 3-2 ratio. This gives the President the final say over election law violations.
If you support #HR1, you support: Giving any candidate for office the ability to sue to dispute the results of any election regardless of the margin of victory.
If you support #HR1, you support: Violating constitutional rights under the first amendment by expanding the definition of political speech increasing the power of the federal government to control it.

On January 4, 1896, Utah joined the union. Happy 123rd Birthday, Utah.
��� Believe it or not, one of the Democrats first actions controlling Congress is to make it easier for them to raise your taxes.I’m a NO vote.
Surely there must be room where we can find a compromise. The Democrats continue to reject offers that provide border security, including offers that take care of our dreamers.                                   
The only ones who benefit from this decision are our adversaries in the region, Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah.  We are working with the administration to see if we can change this policy to one that will protect our vital interest in the region.
Though we have always maintained a very small footprint in Syria, we have had a huge impact on humanitarian, political and military objectives.  Most troubling, if we withdraw, we leave our allies exposed and in a weakened position.
I believe the President’s new policy on Syria is a mistake. Having been to the region many times, working with our partners to bring stability to a very important part of the world, I believe it’s critical for America and our allies to remain engaged.
The Senate is proposing a short-term funding measure through February 8. This is a betrayal of conservative policy and, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will not support the status quo. Kicking the can down the road hurts Utah priorities.
Utahns expect the federal government to fulfill its mandate to provide border security while keeping the government open and operating. I am working on striking a deal that accomplishes both.
Today I joined a group of bi-partisan legislators urging the President to prioritize funding for programs that focus on mental illness, substance use disorder, and suicide prevention.
