Yesterday, I asked Director Kraninger of the CFPB to start gathering information that will help us understand the challenges Latinx college students face with their college loans. Watch here:
On #InternationalWomensDay I honor all women displaced by violence and extreme poverty. I honor their resilience and drive, their determination and strength. We must listen to their voices so we can advance their progress.
Power to the people! Today we passed the #ForThePeople Act, a historic package of democracy reforms, ethics standards, and voting protections to ensure government works for the public interest, not special interests.
Democrats defeated the MTR, we will continue fighting against Republicans' efforts to demonize immigrants.
Last night, I spoke about Beatriz, a DREAMer from my district, who despite the odds, graduated from college. We cannot turn a blind eye to immigrants like Beatriz. It’s time we act now to provide a reasonable pathway to citizenship.
The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California struck down the Trump Administration’s decision to include a citizenship question on the 2020 census, a big step to protect the constitutional mandate to count every person living in the USA.
Too many college students and working families have gotten ripped off by bad lenders. I’m proud to stand with @RepMaxineWaters in support of the Consumers First Act, which would help re-establish a dedicated student loan office within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
LIVE AT THE US CAPITOL -- Joining the @HispanicCaucus this morning to welcome DREAMers and TPS holders to DC. It’s time we fix our broken immigration system. Watch here:
I am outraged that our government detention centers hold people in inhumane conditions. We must continue to speak out for people being harmed in government centers. The Trump administration is violating human rights and we must end these practices.
El recorte de precio a la insulina anunciado ayer es un paso adelante. Debemos seguir luchando por reducir el precio de medicinas con receta para que todos los que las necesitan puedan tener acceso a ellas.
The price cut for insulin announced yesterday is a step in the right direction. We must continue to fight to reduce prescription drug prices so every person who needs lifesaving medications can afford them.
Happy 182nd birthday to my hometown, Chicago! ¡Feliz cumpleaños a mi querido Chicago!
Trump’s zero tolerance policy does not make our country safer. It inflicts pain on families fleeing poverty and violence. We must end this inhumane policy and hold USCIS accountable for the delays in processing immigration cases and asylum applications.
It took a lawsuit for DHS to extend #TPS till 2020 for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti and Sudan. It brings some relief, but we need permanent protections and a path to citizenship. I look forward to working with my colleagues on #HR6 the Dream and Promise Act.
Excited to have a date for the introduction of #HR6, the Dream and Promise Act.  #Dreamers and #TPS holders deserve a path to citizenship. Thanks to @RepRoybalAllard, @NydiaVelazquez @RepYvetteClarke for their work on this bill.
There have already been 241 shootings in Chicago this year, even with the strict gun laws we have. To protect our communities we need universal background checks. I support #HR8 and H.R. 1112.
Our health care system must do more to provide quality, affordable health care for people in my district like Victor, which is why I joined my colleagues today to introduce the #MedicareForAll Act.
LIVE AT THE CAPITOL with @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell Dingell introducing #MedicareforAll. Far too many people remain uninsured in this country, including many in my district. Health care is a basic, human right. We need #MedicareForAll.
Tune in to watch the #MedicareForAll press conference on my Facebook page at 11:15 ET with @RepJayapal and @RepDebDingell. Everyone deserves quality health care. There are people in my district who have to choose between their doctor’s appointment and paying their electric bill.
Congratulations to Carmen Ayala on her appointment as the first woman and Latinx Illinois State Superintendent of Education! I know she will help create more educational opportunities for students. Great choice by Governor Pritzker.
Since when do we call human beings in need national emergencies? We must reject the President’s premise that the presence of people like me in the country, of people like the constituents in my district, constitutes a national emergency.
I remain deeply concerned and disturbed to learn that the inhumane practice of separating children from their parents is still happening. No family should be torn apart by border patrol agents or by a broken immigration system. Stop Trump’s #FakeNationalEmergency
Border crossings are down to one-fifth of what they were in 2000. This emergency declaration is just one more step in the President’s anti-immigrant agenda and a violation of our democracy. Proud to stand with my colleagues to terminate Trump’s #FakeEmergency
Look at the creative thank you letter I got from the @HANACenter team! The work they do on immigration and Korean-American civic engagement in Illinois is so important.
Humbled for the recognition I received last night from the Chicago Area Project, an organization I was privileged enough to work with when I headed Enlace Chicago. What they have done over 85 years of existence for the Chicago youth is to be celebrated and applauded.
Community engagement and youth development have always been priorities to me in every job I’ve done. Now as a congressman, my commitment is still the same and I’ll continue working towards violence prevention in all of its forms.
These students had brilliant policy questions for me today. Topics ranged from financial services, to transportation and infrastructure to Puerto Rico. They make me hopeful about the future of our community.
Had a stimulating conversation with talented young Latinx students at @UICLares, the Latin American Recruitment and Educational Services Program, at my alma mater @thisisUIC. LARES helps students achieve their educational goals.
Thank you to @HACIAworks for having me at their 40th annual banquet. As a member of the Transportation Infrastructure Commitee, I felt privileged to speak on the importance of infrastructure solutions that have Hispanics at the forefront.
Niños y familias vulnerables buscando refugio en la frontera no es una emergencia nacional. Este abuso de poder por parte del Presidente Trump no se puede permitir en un país donde existe balance de poderes.
Vulnerable children and families seeking safety at the border is not a national emergency. This power grab by the president cannot stand in a country of checks and balances, and we’ll make sure it doesn’t.
Today in my home state, I joined civil rights leaders and groups to tell President Trump we will uphold the Constitution against his lawless emergency declaration.
I will be joining IL AG Kwame Raoul, immigration and civil rights groups today at noon at Chicago’s Federal Plaza to protest Trump’s unlawful emergency declaration. See you there!
Inspired, along with San Juan, PR Mayor @CarmenYulinCruz, to see the current generation of young Latinx leaders shaping our American democracy. They are not only the future but are the present, reclaiming the country we so dearly love.
Thank you to @TheUSHLI for the invite to discuss our broken  immigration system. Honored to share the stage with @RepDebHaaland, @RepRaulGrijalva, @CongressmanRaja, and Esther Lopez from The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW).
Another shooting has taken the lives of innocent people, now in Aurora, IL, just outside my district. My thoughts are with the families of the victims, and the families of the police officers injured in the line of duty.
The emergency declaration Trump announced today is an abuse of power. He wants to build an ineffective and wasteful wall to appeal to his political base. Congress must protect the integrity of our democracy and take action against the President's violation of the Constitution.
My parents, Miguel and Celia, came to the US to build a better future for me my family. It is the honor of my life to serve my community here in Congress. And I want to tell every immigrant in this country today: you are welcome here you are valued. #ToImmigrantsWithLove
Today marks one year since the tragedy at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Let’s pause to remember the 17 lives lost that day. #NeverForget
In honor of Black History Month, I'm remembering Mayor Harold Washington, my friend and political mentor.
Listened to the story of Christine, a TSA agent at the O’Hare Airport, who used her savings to buy gas and food during the last shutdown. For TSA workers like Christine, another #TrumpShutdown is not possible. Watch my remarks here:
Me enteré con gran tristeza sobre la trágica noticia de la muerte del pastor Vic de @LaVillitaChi, como todos lo llamábamos. Estoy agradecido de haberlo conocido y de llamarlo amigo.
I was saddened to learn the tragic news of the passing of Pastor Vic of @LaVillitaChi, as we all called him. He dedicated his life to improving our community, working particularly with at-risk youth. This is a huge loss for my district and for Chicago.
Jazz trumpeter @johndaversa and his band of 53 DREAMers won 3 Grammy awards last night. Congratulations and thank you for giving a voice to these talented and courageous musicians.
The passing of @RepWalterJones (NC-03) is a loss for all of us in the US Congress. He was one of the most moderate voices in the GOP, who constantly crossed the aisle to work in a bipartisan manner. My condolences to his family.
Gracias al Community Navigator Program por invitarme a la Reunión del Fondo de Protección Legal 2019. Estoy feliz de trabajar junto a organizaciones que ofrecen invaluables recursos a nuestra comunidad migrante para su bienestar legal.
Today I joined the Community Navigator Program at the 2019 Legal Protection Fund Convening. This is an essential program to help people in our community understand their legal rights.
Venezuela is living a political, economic and humanitarian crisis. But Trump does not have authorization to use military force. I am cosponsoring a bill prohibiting US military action in Venezuela. We need to work with allies and pursue diplomatic avenues.
He pensado mucho en Raquel Guerrero esta semana. Ella estuvo involucrada en todos los esfuerzos por hacer que Pilsen fuera una comunidad mejor. Ella alzó su voz por los inmigrantes y las familias trabajadoras. Agradezco haberla tenido como ejemplo.
I’ve been thinking a lot about Raquel Guerrero. She was involved in every effort to make Pilsen a better community. She was a fierce voice for immigrants and for working families. She was a strong woman and I am grateful to have had her as a role model.
Noah was proud to show his art book, which featured a Catrina face on the cover. His after-school program at Telpochcalli Elementary also includes running, and his mom tags along sometimes!
The Chicago Arts Partnership in Education (CAPE) just held an impressive art exhibit featuring the work of students from different schools, including North-Grand High School and Telpochcalli Elementary, both in my district.
Hundreds of thousands of young, talented DREAMers have benefited from the implementation of DACA. DACA recipients are the lawyers, business owners, and teachers who serve as the backbone of my home in the fourth district. They deserve to live without fear. #ProtectDACA
Wishing my friend and tireless predecessor Luis Gutierrez a fast recovery. Follow the doctor’s orders and don’t give your wife a hard time.
My deepest condolences @RepDebDingell. John Dingell helped shape crucial legislation in the US Congress, including civil rights and health care. His legacy of bipartisanship is something we should aspire to.
I joined @TransportDems to be a voice for my constituents and to help build a transportation system that works for everyone. Watch my first Committee hearing remarks here: 
People in my community use pay day lenders to get cash. They will be hurt by the Trump administration rolling back rules that were meant to protect them. As a Member of the Financial Services Committee, I will work to hold the administration accountable.
Chicago Urban Coalition takes on D.C. and visits Congressman Chuy García with Reverend Walter June, Mr. Howard Latham, and Ken Butler. @WGPStakeholders
My neighbors rely on the buses and Blue, Pink, and Orange lines everyday. How can something so valuable to people not be a national priority? #TheCostOfInaction
Today, @TransportDems will address our country's critical need for infrastructure investment. Because Chicago is one of the largest transportation hubs in the nation, fixing America's bridges and transit systems must be a priority.
I am an immigrant. I take this issue personally. The way the President has characterized immigrants denigrates the dignity and the humanity of millions around the world, including myself. Watch my speech on the floor of the House of Representatives here:
Trump gave one of the longest SOTU speeches ever but he failed to present an infrastructure plan to rebuild railways and transit and put people back to work.

My three words after @POTUS’ State of the Union tonight.
O’Hare International was the busiest passenger airport in the US last year. I'm looking forward to hearing what @POTUS will say tonight about investing in infrastructure projects in our country to keep major transportation hubs like O’Hare at its best.
We need to hold the Trump administration accountable for the damage it has caused to migrant children by separating them from their families. We must continue to work to ensure all children are accounted for and reunited with their families.
Thanks to @icirr for the invite! Walls are not a solution. We need to find a permanent solution for DREAMers and TPS holders and stop the Trump anti-immigrant agenda.
Ready for the 9th Annual Illinois Immigrant Integration Policy Summit and Citizenship Workshop with @icirr and @eriehouse! Proud to stand with my community and advocate together for immigrants who are working to become citizens.
Thanks to our courageous firefighters who helped save a family from a house fire in Little Village on Wednesday. Here are some tips from the Red Cross on how to keep your family safe in the winter. #StaySafe

Este sábado 2 de feb. estaré en el Taller de Ciudadanía organizado por Erie House y ICRR, empieza a las 8:30 AM, en Malcom X College, Conference Hall A, 1900 W. Jackson Blvd., Chicago.
Today, Chairman Jeffries, Vice Chair Clark, and I discussed our commitment to make healthcare accessible for all. In my district, people with diabetes are asking me to ensure that life saving medications such as insulin remain affordable.
Are you a fourth district resident? Then check out the list of parks in the district that are serving as warming places during the snowstorm:
Federal workers are heading back to work, but their paychecks have yet to arrive. What’s worse, employees of contractors will not get paid. Congress needs to address the aftermath of the #TrumpShutdown and pass a bill that pays all workers.
Holocaust Remembrance Day is a reminder of our failure to address racism and discrimination that still lives on today. The 6 million victims of the Holocaust and the lessons from their fate should never be forgotten. #WeRemember
Today's news of mandatory ground stops of flights is deeply concerning. This #TrumpShutdown is threatening the livelihoods of airport workers desperate for a paycheck and is impeding the flow of air traffic. Senator McConnell and President Trump must reopen the government now!
Catch me on @cspanwj tomorrow discussing the Trump Shutdown at 8:30 AM ET!
@SecretaryRoss is so out of touch with families who live paycheck to paycheck, he doesn’t understand why federal workers who aren’t getting paid are getting meals from a food pantry. Tell @senatemajldr and @POTUS to do their jobs and open the government.
Shelters in my district assisting domestic violence survivors, like Mujeres Latinas en Acción and Connections for Abused Women and Children, are losing resources because of the Trump shutdown. I joined this letter asking DOJ how it intends to fund life-saving programs.
@FTA_DOT safety inspectors who keep our commuters safe aren’t getting paid. Air traffic controllers who keep our airways safe won't be able to provide for themselves and their families. That’s why I voted for the 10th time today to reopen the government.
No nutrition programs means families and children are going hungry. It’s time to reopen the government and give working families their SNAP benefits.
The TSA workers at Midway and O’Hare are keeping us safe, but they’re not getting paid. They don’t know how they’ll pay their rent. @POTUS and @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell, do your job. #EndTheShutdown
DACA must be protected. We will not allow these young people to be used as a bargaining chip for @realDonaldTrump’s border wall. I and other House Democrats will not stop fighting for a proper pathway to citizenship.
The fate of #DACA is uncertain and it’s critical to #renewDACA immediately. #ProtectDACA
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. sought change through non-violent means and dreamed of an America where everyone would have equal opportunity regardless of the color of their skin. There is no better way to honor him by working everyday towards progress, fairness, and opportunity.

@POTUS has gone on television again with a proposal that is a sham. It fails to bring 800,000 public employees back to work and fails to address permanent solutions to DACA and TPS. President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell need to reopen the government.
Today at Federal Plaza, my colleagues @RepSchakowsky, @RepDannyDavis, @RepBillFoster, @RepRobinKelly, @RepUnderwood, @RepCasten, and I demand that President Trump and the Senate reopen the government. It’s day 28 of the shutdown. This is unacceptable.

When you think it can’t get any worse, a new report reveals thousands more children were separated from their families at the border. The real number is unknown. This unprecedented level of cruelty towards immigrants goes against our values. We must hold Trump admin accountable.
RT @TransportDems: Welcome to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, @RepChuyGarcia!
from homeownership and financial security. As a Member of the @TransportDems, I’m committed to bringing much needed economic development and investment to Chicago’s aging roadways, airports, railways and transit network, especially for communities long underserved.
My appointment to the powerful Financial Services Committee gives Chicagoans a voice in shaping important banking and housing policy. I plan to address unfair lending practices and decades-long, racial injustice issues that disproportionately bar low-income communities of color

Joined my colleagues @Ilhan, @RepJudyChu, and many other Members today in support of women’s health at a press conference with @PPFA. We must support and protect women’s rights to access vital health services against this administration.
Joined freshman Members of Congress to tell @senatemajldr about how families in our communities are being affected by the shutdown. It’s time for Senator Mitch McConell to do his job and end the shutdown.

I am proud that my fellow colleagues from the Chicago congressional delegation have already voted five times to open parts of or all the federal government. We need to open the government immediately.
Thank you @WBBMNewsradio for attending our community roundtable about the #TrumpShutdown. This government shutdown is irresponsible and harmful. It’s time to end it.
Each day the shutdown continues, the American people suffer. Instead of playing political games, this President and Sen. Mitch McConnell must recognize that for the average, hard-working American, the government shutdown is a lose-lose situation and families are suffering.
Watch our live press conference on the Trump Shutdown here:
In Chicago today to discuss how the #TrumpShutdown is having real effects on the lives of the constituents in my district. #EndTheShutdown
It’s Day 21 of the #TrumpShutdown. Americans are starting to receive their paystubs from the federal government that read $0. This wouldn’t be happening if @realDonaldTrump wasn’t desperate to try and get his wasteful wall. #EndTheShutdown
Since the day I was sworn in, my House colleagues I voted to reopen the government. This week, we tried again with one goal: to ensure Americans received their tax returns on time. It’s time for Republicans to step up and help end this irresponsible #TrumpShutdown

Because of the #TrumpShutdown, housing vouchers may not get to families in need, leaving them at risk of homelessness.
