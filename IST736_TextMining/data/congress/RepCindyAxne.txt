Today, I voted for #HR1 to make sure every Iowan's voice is heard. It's time to get money out of politics and corruption out of Washington.
All women in Iowa and across the country have the right to feel safe in their homes and in their communities. I’m proud to sponsor the bipartisan #VAWA reauthorization to keep our communities safer and better protect support millions of victims and survivors across the country.
Our legislation would reestablish the @CFPB’s Office of Students and Young Consumers and restore supervision to prevent unscrupulous lenders from targeting active duty military.
Student borrowers and active duty military in Iowa are particularly vulnerable to predatory lending practices. Yesterday, I joined members of the Financial Services Committee to strengthen protections against this type of financial harm. 
Caught up with @KMAMike today to talk about my plans to fix our broken health care system in order to improve access to quality, affordable care for all Iowans. Listen to the interview here:
I promised Iowans that I would fight to expand access to quality, affordable health care for everyone. That includes our children who were born with congenital anomalies. Thank you @WHOhd for talking to me about this important issue.
As an elected official, you should never be allowed to cash out on your service to the public. My amendment to #HR1 would prohibit Members of Congress from ever serving as lobbyists.
Iowans deserve to know that their hard-earned taxpayer dollars are being used to help move our country forward, not to pay for luxury travel for politicians. I introduced an amendment to #HR1 to ban Members of Congress from using taxpayer dollars for first-class flights.
I promised Iowans that I would be a voice for everyday people in Washington and fight to get money out of politics. I was proud to introduce two amendments to strengthen #HR1, the campaign finance reform bill. 
Last Friday, we visited the Evelyn K. Davis Center for Working Families to learn about how they educate and train Iowans for success. Director Marvin DeJear, Assistant Director Joy Esposito, and the entire team at EKDC are making an incredible impact on Des Moines families.
About to join @WHOhd to talk about bipartisan bills to expand access to health care and save taxpayer dollars that I’m working on in Washington. Watch LIVE here:

During #BlackHistoryMonth we celebrate brave leaders like Edna M. Griffin whose courageous efforts led to the 1949 Iowa Supreme Court ruling that made it illegal to deny service based on race in Iowa.
The Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act would close a coverage gap by requiring insurance companies and health plans cover serious dental and oral procedures needed to treat congenital anomalies, or birth defects.
There’s nothing ‘cosmetic’ about ensuring children suffering from genetic disorders can chew, swallow and speak. I’m proud to join @SenJoniErnst in this bipartisan effort to ensure Iowa children suffering from birth defects can get the care they need at an affordable price.
Meet Alli Steele and Amelia Lucas Ward from Dallas County. They suffer from a rare genetic disorder that prevents the development of teeth. Insurance plans can deny coverage for medically necessary procedures to treat birth defects, calling it 'cosmetic'
.@USDA Under Secretary Bill Northey and I worked together at the State of Iowa when he was Iowa’s Secretary of Agriculture. Looking forward to working with him again to help Iowa farmers and our renewable energy sector.
Last stop of the day: The Hub Grind in Council Bluffs. Talked with folks about how we can lower our national debt.

Had to say a quick thank you to the folks who keep our kids fed and full at Edmunds Elementary.
I sent both my boys to coding camp because I know how important it is for our kids to have these technological skills in our evolving digital economy. We need to make sure that every child in Iowa has the opportunity to learn computer science and STEM education.
Thank you @Google for choosing Edmunds Elementary to roll out the CS First Program! We need to make sure we’re providing kids w/ the skills they need for good-paying jobs. That starts w/ encouraging students, particularly young girls, to get excited abt computer science early on.
Heard from constituents at Smokey Row in Des Moines about ending homelessness in the community, supporting early education, and helping our entrepreneurs access capital.
See you soon DSM!
Medicare Advantage provides comprehensive, affordable health care services to over 100,000 seniors in Iowa. I’m committed to protecting this vital program. Honored to be a recipient of the 2019 Medicare Advantage Champion Award.
Back home in Des Moines this week. Had a great conversation with health care professionals about how we can lower costs and expand coverage. Looking forward to working on these issues to help hardworking Iowa families.
I'll be at Smokey Row in Des Moines tomorrow from 8:30-9:30am to catch up with constituents! Come swing by and say hi!

It was great to talk with people in Lacona about problems and challenges they’re facing in their communities and what I can do back in Washington to better help our farmers.

Tonight I voted for the bipartisan, bicameral deal to keep the government open and strengthen our border security. I strongly urge the President to sign this deal. It’s time to move our country forward.
Remembering the victims of the Parkland and Northern Illinois massacres today and the unimaginable grief their family and friends have experienced because of senseless gun violence.
Great to meet Iowa’s 4-H Healthy Living Ambassadors. Talked abt nutrition health policy and empowering youth to be leaders in their communities. As a 4-H alumna, it was great to reflect on the experiences I had, the skills I gained, and the positive impacts 4-H has on our youth
RT @WHOhd: Students Make Valentines for Iowa Veterans
To all the men and women who have served our country: Happy Valentines Day from first graders at Jackson Elementary!
Unfortunately I couldn’t be there in person because I’m in DC making sure we keep the gov’t open. But so glad my team back in Des Moines was able to join students at Jackson Elementary in making Valentines for veterans!
When it comes to decorating offices and suites, high-ranking government officials shouldn't have a blank check. Iowans deserve to know their hard earned tax dollars are being used to benefit the public good, not to decorate a suite. 
Joined @RepArrington in introducing the "No Budget, No Recess" Act. Our bipartisan bill is very similar to the Senate version introduced by @SenJoniErnst to prevent lawmakers from leaving Washington if they fail to pass a budget.

As a 5th generation Iowan from a farm family, I grew up with an appreciation for the amount of work it takes to feed people here in Iowa and around the world. I spoke with @agripulse about my plans to better support Iowa farmers.
Un-affordable child care should never prevent a veteran from receiving the care he or she needs. Proud to have supported the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act which ensures safe, cost-free child care options when a veteran has a medical appointment.
During our visit to Cass County Health System last week, I ran into these great young women from the Child Healthcare class at AHSTW High School in Avoca. As part of their curriculum, they were on the way to watch a birthing simulation with the hospital’s pregnant robot.

Just left our last stop in Guthrie County on our 8 county rural health care tour visiting health care centers across #IA03. I couldn’t be more proud of how our communities have come together to provide the best services for the people in our district.
Great discussion at Taylor County Public Health about how we can better provide in-house care for Iowans in rural communities.
I’m here at the Cass County Health System in Atlantic, Iowa on the 2nd stop of my #IA03 rural health care tour. I’m looking forward to talking with physicians patients to learn about what I can do in Washington to ensure families in Cass County have access to quality care.
Today I’m visiting 8 rural health centers, clinics and hospitals across southwest Iowa to learn about the unique challenges of providing access to quality, affordable health care in our rural communities. My first stop was at the Redfield Medical Clinic in Dallas County.
Wage discrimination continues to impact women and families across Iowa. Closing this pay disparity wouldn’t just help Iowa’s working families, but would provide a significant boom to our economy. I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct to ensure #equalpay.
Iowa can't afford another government shutdown. Joined @KCCINews to discuss my bill to end all shutdowns. Under my bill, if Congress and the President fail to reach a budget deal, the government stays open, but lawmakers don't get paid. It's time to hold Washington accountable.
At my 1st Financial Services Cmte hearing. Having spent a decade helping Iowa’s state agencies deliver services more efficiently, I know the importance of being a steward of taxpayer dollars and prioritizing gov accountability. I plan to bring my efficiency expertise to @FSCDems.
Today, I joined @RepFinkenauer and colleagues to introduce legislation to end government shutdowns. Our bill says: if lawmakers can’t agree on a budget, lawmakers don’t get paid. It’s time to stop punishing everyday Iowans for Washington dysfunction.

The significant hardship this shutdown has caused our economy, our communities, and our families was completely avoidable. Iowa federal contractors, farmers and small business owners won’t get reimbursed for the economic hit they took because of this government dysfunction.
I’m pleased Congressional leaders and the President reached a deal to re-open the government. But no matter which political party is in charge, the practice of using a shutdown to advance any political or policy agenda is unacceptable.

Congratulations to Gov Reynolds on her historic win. I'm looking forward to working with @IAGovernor on crucial issues like strengthening our rural communities, increasing access to mental health services, and ensuring every Iowan has the skills they need for a good paying job.
There is so much we can do to partner at the local, state and federal level to improve the lives of all Iowans. Joined by @RepFinkenauer, @ChuckGrassley and @SenJoniErnst at the @IAGovernor inauguration.
The federal grant process is supposed to help our local communities. But our current system is so outdated burdensome, we’re leaving money on the table. House passed my bipartisan bill today to streamline this process, making it easier to help Iowans.
Great news! I will be serving on the House Agriculture Committee. Proud to represent Iowa and serve as a voice for our farmers.
Today, I voted to increase federal emergency relief for Iowa farmers, biz owners, local counties struggling to overcome disaster-related hardships. As we work to build a stronger more resilient Iowa, our communities need help to get back on their feet.
I look forward to serving as a champion of bipartisan solutions to ensure our banking and financial institutions are working to support hardworking Iowa families and create jobs in our rural communities.

But first, we must re-open the government.
Proud to stand with my family as Judge Bob Pratt, US District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa, presided over my Iowa swearing-in ceremony. I am humbled and honored to represent #IA03. I'm committed to serving as a champion of commonsense solutions to move our country fwd.
Thank you to all of our dedicated public servants who are working to keep us safe and provide us with crucial services, without a paycheck.
Air Traffic Controllers are vital to the safety of air travel. Chatted today with the Des Moines International Airport Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) about how this shutdown is impacting the safety and efficient flow of air traffic across the world.

Iowans: this SAT at 10 am, I’m holding an in-district swearing-in ceremony at my Des Moines district office. After the ceremony, I will talk about my priorities for the 116th Congress, starting with the need to re-open the gov ASAP. Click here to RSVP:
Yesterday I took my first vote to protect Iowans with pre-existing conditions. I've said from day one, I will do everything in my power to make sure we never go back to a time when insurers could deny coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.
I do not believe that it is appropriate for Members of Congress to receive paychecks while Iowa families suffer and our security is compromised due to government dysfunction. I've requested for my paycheck to be withheld until the government re-opens.
Iowans are feeling the very real impact of this shutdown. Right now in our own backyard, small business owners are suffering, farmers are struggling to provide for their families and agencies tasked with keeping us safe are understaffed and unpaid. It's time to end this shutdown.
I will support measures that effectively strengthen our border security, but I want to make sure we spend taxpayer dollars wisely, while also keeping our government fully open and operational.
That's why I voted for over a billion dollars in funding for more border patrol agents, drones, e-sensors, and other innovative technologies that can better secure our borders and protect our communities.
I've always said we need to strengthen our border security. As a member of Congress, and as a mom, my first priority is to keep our communities and our families safe.
All Iowans are impacted by this partial government shutdown. But Iowa farmers are paying a heavy price.
Due to the shutdown, @USDA will now delay crucial crop reports, which could affect commodity prices for Iowa farmers already struggling with uncertainty due to government dysfunction.  It’s time for Congress to work together to re-open our government.
We are problem solvers. We are multi-taskers. And we are ready to get to work. #116thCongress
@ryanwfrederick Hi @ryanwfrederick, we were at the Warren Cultural Center earlier in December. I'll be back in Adair later this month! Please continue to check my Twitter feed for more updates.
Talked with the @OWHnews yesterday about my plans to work with my Democratic and Republican colleagues on policies to expand access to rural broadband and support our farmers.
On the air with @kmanews1 talking about my first day in office! What an honor it was to be sworn into office yesterday.
We have a responsibility to our constituents to find solutions to strengthen our border security without holding the paychecks of hundreds of thousands of federal employees hostage. This legislative package allows us to do just that.
Excited to start working with my friend and fellow Congresswoman, Abby Finkenauer! Chatting with @DavePriceTV this morning about our priorities and plans to support hardworking Iowa families in the #116thCongress.
While I look forward to passing crucial legislation to help hardworking Iowa families, my first order of business will be to re-open the government and ensure that every single federal employee receives the paycheck they’ve earned.
With the start of the 116th Congress, we have an opportunity, and a duty to our constituents, to put party aside and work together to move our country forward.
Today, I took the oath of office to serve as the U.S. Representative from Iowa's Third Congressional District. In the #116thCongress, I will work tirelessly to deliver the highest level of constituent services and ensure the voices of all Iowans are heard in Washington.
