Law enforcement professionals tasked with securing our borders don't need DC bureaucrats or politicians to tell them what their mission is. All they need is for Congress to provide the resources that they have clearly and properly requested.
According to @DHSgov, the crisis on our southern border is at a "breaking point" with 76,000+ apprehensions last month. We need an all-of-the-above strategy on border security, an end to legal loopholes, and more support for @CBP.

Relentless, vitriolic attack. Take a good look America. This is all you’ll see out of every Democrat controlled House Committee for the next 2 years - which Socialist can claw their way deeper into the pit. Every day, it will be a contest.
Their hate for President Trump is greater than their love for America.Time to secure our border.
In 2006, 26 Senate Democrats voted for The Secure Fence Act, which allowed for 700 miles of fencing along the border.In 2013, 54 Senate Democrats voted to invest $46B in border security improvements and added 700 miles of fencing.What's different now?
The House passed funding for the border wall. This is mission critical for our border agents. Senate Democrats will use the cloture rule to block this bill. We could end this shutdown fight and deliver wall funding by suspending the Senate cloture rule.
Once Speaker Pelosi takes the gavel, any effort to secure the border will be dead on arrival. The time to act is now.
