Pre-existing conditions are a real #NationalEmergency, but Trump and the Republicans want to sabotage the #ACA without presenting a replacement. So far the only component of #TrumpCare is a loss of coverage for millions of Americans. #SOTU
Estate tax relief was for the super rich like Trump and his mega donors at Mar-a-Lago #lies
Sadly not true. We are not the "hottest" economy in the world, and likely won't be with Trump's policies. #SOTU
Tomorrow morning the House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on #GunViolence in America. An era of ignoring the problems and offering hollow moments of silence is over. We are offering action. #GunSense #NeverAgain Watch live at 10am EST
Trayvon Martin would be 24 years old today. I continue to be disappointed by the miscarriage of justice in his case. His family and friends are in my heart, and the fight for justice and equality must continue. #SayHisName #TrayvonMartin
I'll be joining @RepJohnLewis and others in boycotting the #SOTU. I’ll come to the House Chamber for the State of the Union when I can hear from a president who will tell the #Truth. I’ll watch on TV, Trump’s preferred medium, although I won’t be his audience, his believing base.
Trump has always been lazy and self-absorbed. It’s no surprise he spends 60% of the day in #ExecutiveTime (getting guidance from Fox News) instead of doing his job.
Follow your shot!Clean up your own mess!Dont litter!
Every president since Nixon has voluntarily given their #TaxReturns. #Trump hasn’t. There’s a reason for that, he has a lot to hide.
#Trump says he won’t read the border security bill unless it has wall funding. I’m not sure he can read anyway. He’s not mentally, morally, or educationally up for the job. #UnFit
If he understood the horrors of Jim Crow segregation he wouldn’t have allowed that in his year book. This says something about him. He had no #SocialJustice in his heart or in his mind he didn’t look at African Americans as being equal to him. #NorthamMustResign
I’m about to go on @MSNBC with @AlexWitt to discuss the #TrumpShutDown, Trump’s #TaxReturns, and more.
Governor Northam @GovernorVA is now less favorable than  Howard Schultz. Dr. Northam needs to go Dunkin Donuts and smell the coffee.Resign!
Protect our feathered fellow species. #animallovers #birdwatching
Justice Department should pursue justice
