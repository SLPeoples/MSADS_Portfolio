The 116th Congress is the youngest, most diverse ever, and has the most women members in history. Honored to serve with these strong, leaders who fight every day for the communities they represent. #WomensHistoryMonth
I met with North Texans from @PVA1946 this week to discuss how we can all work together to ensure we get our veterans the health care they need. Thank you for all you do for veterans!
A statesman, veteran, Texan, and true patriot, Congressman Ralph Hall exemplified what it meant to be a leader and public servant. My thoughts are with Congressman Hall’s family and loved ones.

The @ymca made my life possible and every day the Y, its staff and volunteers make our country a better place.It was great to meet with Texans representing The Y in Washington today!
On my first day in Congress, I introduced a resolution that would protect the ACA in federal court and now I’m urging House leadership to focus on concrete action that will lower costs and strengthen the health care system for everyone. #ProtectOurCare
Citizens shouldn't be deterred from voting just b/c their polling place was moved. As a voting rights attorney, I know how partisan interests try to make it harder to exercise your right to vote. My bill is a step in the right direction: #ForThePeople
With 1 million outpatient visits and 240,000 ER visits, @Parkland plays an important role in our region’s health care system. I had the opportunity to tour Parkland and meet its dedicated and talented staff. Thanks for all your work for North Texas!
It was great to be with the @RichardsonTX_PD at their annual awards banquet this weekend to honor all the hardworking public servants for their bravery and dedication to keeping their community safe.
The American people are counting on us to get things done. That's why Congress must work together on things like infrastructure and lowering the cost of prescription drugs. Watch my interview with @NBCDFW where I discuss the latest from Washington and my work for #TX32. �
A key House committee has advanced H.R. 1, and we are scheduled to vote on it next week. This bill will clean up corruption in Washington, and with strong voter protections and campaign finance reform, will protect strengthen our democracy for everyone.
Proud of the bill I cosponsored which passed as part of #PublicLands package that will reauthorize the Historically Black Colleges Universities Preservation program. It funds renovations to restore preserve buildings at HBCUs in TX across the nation
Always so inspiring to meet with Texans interested in public service. Thanks to the @TheLBJSchool for having me for a discussion at their Washington campus this week.

I am so grateful for all your well wishes after spending some time back home in Dallas with family after the birth of our son, Jordan. Watch my quick video update on my week back in Washington working for the people of #TX32 in Congress.
Yesterday at @ForeignAffairs I had the distinct honor of asking some questions of former Secretary of State @Madeleine Albright. Diplomacy and engaging in the international community is more important than ever. Thank you Madam Secretary for your service and expertise.
I am grateful to celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth as a member of the largest @OfficialCBC in Congressional history. As we end this month, I hope we carry the determination and fearlessness of the American heroes who fought oppression and bigotry for a more equal and just America.
It was an honor to take part in a joint House @VetAffairsDems and  Senate Veterans' Affairs hearing today with the @AmericanLegion to discuss how we can work together for our veterans in this Congress.
As a new father, it's clearer than ever to me that keeping families and North Texas neighborhoods safe is paramount. Strengthening background checks is a common-sense move that protects the 2nd amendment while taking action to prevent gun violence. #TX32
58 former national security officials signed a letter opposing the @POTUS declaration. And tonight, I voted for @JoaquinCastrotx’s bipartisan resolution that stops @POTUS from setting a dangerous precedent by building a wall without Congressional approval.
Whether it’s high-speed rail or other smart transit, when we invest in our infrastructure we must consider climate change and its impacts. North Texas can and should lead the way. Watch our hearing today with @transportdems: #ActOnClimate

Civil rights leader Juanita Craft was the first black woman to vote in Dallas, and worked tirelessly to empower African Americans in N. Texas. Her efforts to end segregation, and her work for the NAACP, and the Dallas City Council made N. Texas a better place. #BlackHistoryMonth
North Texans know we need real action when it comes to investing in our infrastructure. As a member of @TransportDems I am dedicated to passing a bill this Congress that addresses our region's growing transportation needs. #TX32

Today we commemorate the birthday of our first president, George Washington and honor our nation’s Presidents who through difficult times showed leadership and upheld their oath to preserve, protect and defend our Constitution. #PresidentsDay
Student loan servicers need proper oversight and should be held accountable when they break the rules. Folks with student debt need the U.S. Department of Education to have their backs with commonsense protections. We must do better.
The tax bill that passed last Congress was incredibly irresponsible. The deficit is now up 41%. I am dedicated to governing responsibly, and helping working and middle class North Texans, not the special interests.
It was great to meet with @TXInstruments and take a tour of their campus. TI has an important role in North Texas and I am proud to represent its many workers who make this company thrive.
An emergency declaration by @POTUS to go around Congress and build a wall would set a dangerous precedent and undermine our constitutional system. We need comprehensive immigration reform that fixes our broken system, not more divisive policies or controversial tactics.
Congress has fulfilled its responsibility and passed a bipartisan spending bill that keeps our government open and working for the American people. I thank my colleagues from both parties for getting this done.
It was an honor to visit @VANorthTexas earlier this week and tour the facility, and deliver Valentine’s greetings from @PershingDISD. Thank you to all the vets who shared their stories with me during our visit, I’m proud to advocate for you as a member of @VetAffairsDems. #TX32

Listening to the people here in North Texas is one of my most important responsibilities as your representative in Congress and I thank everyone who, despite the rain, participated in my #TX32 town hall on Sunday at @richlandcollege.
I'm pleased bipartisan negotiators reached a tentative agreement to fund the government and prevent another shutdown. Let’s do the job we were elected to do and keep working together to get this across the finish line for the American people.

Congressman @JohnDingell was a giant and a powerhouse for good who fought every day for his constituents in Congress. His dedication to public service should serve as an inspiration to everyone. My thoughts are with @RepDebDingell and their family. We lost a legend today.
In 2017, congestion from overcrowded roads cost regular folks who drive an average of $1,445. The time is now to make real investments to address our transportation needs in North Texas and across the country. #TheCostOfInaction
This experience makes it clearer than ever that we need to provide basic paid sick and parental leave so that no matter who you are or where you live, hardworking people can have financial security and peace of mind while spending time with their families.
Family is so important and as a country, we must allow for parents to spend time with their babies because providing parents the ability to stay home during this critical period leads to better outcomes for men, women and families.
Yesterday, I left Washington to head back home to Dallas where I'll be taking a short paternity leave as Aly and I are expecting the birth of our son. We are so thrilled to start this new chapter in our lives. #TX32
The burden of student loan debt affects many generations. We need policies that will make it easier to retire in dignity and lift millions out of financial hardship.
Rosa Parks was a fearless voice for equality, and her decision to say no to injustice catapulted a movement and changed our nation forever. May we always be inspired by her courageous actions. #BlackHistoryMonth
Toured @AmericanAir HQ this week and met with all the hardworking folks who help this company succeed in North Texas and connect millions of travelers across the globe.

It's my hope that @POTUS moves past the politics of division tonight during #SOTU. We should focus on the many areas where we agree as a nation like lowering prescription drug costs or investing in infrastructure. We must work together to get things done for the American people.
I am honored to bring Nathan Cortez from #TX32 as my guest to the #SOTU. Nathan is the husband of the late Natalie Cortez, a brave advocate for protecting Americans’ health care. Her message of hope still inspires me to this day.

Today I visited my old school, @PershingDISD, to meet with students and join them in writing Valentine’s greetings to veterans thanking them for their service. I'm so humbled by these students who are showing appreciation to those who have sacrificed so much for our nation.
More evidence the reckless tax bill passed last Congress is neither helping workers or encouraging businesses to hire. We need common sense tax policy that lifts up small businesses and helps middle class families. 
This is simple, everybody should receive #EqualPay for an honest day’s work. Proud to cosponsor this bill to help ensure #PaycheckFairness.
Relieved the Houston police officers involved are now in stable condition. My thoughts are with the injured officers and their families during this trying and stressful time. We are all so thankful and appreciative of their service and sacrifice.

We must move past shutdown politics for good and work together on behalf of the American people. Watch my interview with @CBSDFW: #TX32
Unacceptable. This shutdown was over a single policy disagreement and now has cost our economy $11 billion. We must make sure this never happens again.
Today I visited @gary_kelly and the @SouthwestAir HQ team in Dallas along w/ @RepEscobar -- we even had the chance to fly a simulator. I’m looking forward to working together to bolster our aviation infrastructure help Southwest create jobs through my role on @TransportDems.

Thank you to the Greater Dallas Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce for hosting such a wonderful Chinese New Year celebration. I look forward to listening, learning and working together over the next two years.
It was great meeting with North Texans this weekend from @USinventors and the @alzassociation, Dallas Northeast Texas Chapter. And thanks to the Akin family for stopping by and saying hello. It is always so inspiring to meet young people who show interest in public service.
Toured U.S. Army Corps Lake Lewisville site w/ my colleague @michaelcburgess this week. It’s so important we work together to bolster our region’s water infrastructure and I thank @USACEHQ for sharing their expertise and for their hard work every day on behalf of North Texans.
This is long overdue, but I am glad the President has come to the table and agreed to open the government. Moving forward, I'm hopeful that we can work together in a bipartisan way on the many important issues facing the American people. My statement:
These North Texans deserve to receive the paychecks they have earned instead of needing to apply for unemployment benefits. No more delays. The Senate and the President need to come to the table so this shutdown can end. #EndTheShutdown
Congratulations to @DFWAirport on being named 2019 global Airport of the Year! This recognition is the result of the cooperation and tireless dedication of all the hardworking folks at DFW Airport.

RT @TexasTribune: In a @dallasnews column, @RepColinAllred said Congress should be focused on helping middle-class families take home more…
Our focus should be on helping families take home more of their paychecks, get better jobs lower health care costs. Instead, this shutdown is an attempt to use the paychecks of hardworking folks to win a policy disagreement. Read my op-ed in @dallasnews:
Dr. King embodied the ideals our country was founded upon, and he compelled our nation to live up to the idea that all men were created equal. Today, we honor him by recommitting to working towards a more perfect union, the one he dreamed of. #MLKDay

Thank you for stopping by. As someone who relied on the help of good folks at the @ymca as a kid, I know exactly how important your work is to communities in North Texas and across America. I look forward to working together.
This is simple, no one should have to work without a paycheck. Period. It hurts working families and our economy. Let’s get the government back open and get these folks the paychecks they have earned. #EndTheShutdown
Had a great meeting w/ students from @TheArcherCenter who are in Washington for internship programs. Thanks for visiting and I look forward to all the good work you will do for your country while you're here. And follow our official Instagram at #TX32
It has been more than three weeks since the Violence Against Women Act expired because of this unnecessary government shutdown. This legislation and its invaluable programs should not be held back while this shutdown drags on.
Stories like this are sadly all too common in Texas, which holds the highest uninsured rate in the country. We need a system that works for everyone. And lowering costs for care should be priority number one.
The bottom line. Washington shouldn’t be playing political games with the paychecks of hardworking Texans. We need to open the government and get it working for the American people.
Jeanne is also a veteran and has been in the armed forces or civil service for 32 years.
And Scotty, who works at the Bureau of Prisons and is a veteran. "Being able to serve the community is an honor and pleasure."
At my roundtable yesterday, federal workers shared their stories with me about how the shutdown is hurting them and many others across our region. People like Sandra, who is a single mom and works at TSA at DFW Airport.
Today I held a roundtable w/ federal workers affected by the shutdown. Most of these public servants are working for free and wondering how they’ll be able to make ends meet. It’s time for the Senate to do their job and pass the bipartisan House bills to reopen the government.

It was an honor to be a part of the Parade of Champions today with Highland Park High School students as the their football and tennis teams celebrated state championships. You have made your community proud. #GoScots
We need to return political power to the hands of everyday citizens and make sure their voices are heard.That's why I'm cosponsoring HR 1, which will help stop the influence of big money and special interests, and strengthen our democracy.
I’m proud to have led the effort to take the first step forward this year to protect Americans’ health care. My resolution passed with bipartisan support and will help protect our health care in federal court. #ProtectOurCare
Hardworking Texans their paychecks shouldn't be used as bargaining chips to fulfill an empty political promise. @AFGENational held an event in Dallas today to highlight the harmful impact of this shutdown on workers like Tony, a furloughed veteran. North Texans deserve better.
We voted with bipartisan support last night to open @USTreasury and the IRS, which should be welcomed by @POTUS, not met with veto threats. The American people need to get the tax refunds they are owed and get their mortgages approved in a timely manner.
The American people need to know that Congress is on their side, and we are working together to protect the progress we have made, and work to lower costs for everyone. This resolution is a first, but important step in that effort.
My resolution that puts the House back on the side of the American people just passed w/ bipartisan support. I made a promise to North Texans that I'll fight every day to defend their health care, including protections for those w/ pre-existing conditions.
Learn more about the resolution here:
In a few minutes, I will be speaking on the House floor in support of our resolution to defend the Affordable Care Act in U.S. federal court. Watch here:
This morning I was with my colleagues discussing our work to end the shutdown and our resolution that puts the House back on the side of the people and protects the Affordable Care Act. Proud to help lead this charge to #ProtectOurCare. Watch:
.@POTUS offered no solutions and no end to a shutdown that he caused, over a border wall we don’t need and can’t afford. This is not the leadership the American people need. We can open the government tomorrow if the President will just come to the table.
In my first Dear Colleague letter I’m urging my colleagues to support my resolution to defend the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and it’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions in court. Tomorrow’s vote will put the House back on the side of the people!
Good meeting w/ Cesar and Ryan from @NATCA Texas who updated me on how the shutdown is impacting air traffic controllers, half of which are veterans in North Texas. We need to end this shutdown so that our economy can stay on track and so that our govt can get back to work.
Today, on the anniversary of the tragic shooting in Tuscon when Rep. Gabby Giffords and 18 others were shot, and six were killed, Congress will introduce a background check bill as a common-sense first step toward reducing senseless gun violence.
Ordinary folks should not fear they will lose their health care because of a partisan lawsuit. My resolution puts the weight of the US House behind the fight to ensure this lawsuit fails, and protections for those w/ pre-existing conditions remain intact.
We can work together on real border security and comprehensive immigration reform. But the President shouldn’t be holding government funding hostage over an expensive, ineffective wall that we don’t need.

Unacceptable. This shutdown is hurting job growth and taking a toll on North Texans’ paychecks. Mortgages can’t be approved and federal employees are working without pay. @POTUS needs to come to the table and work w/ Congress to open the govt immediately.
Tune in to @FaceTheNation tomorrow at 9:30 AM CST as I join my fellow freshmen colleagues to discuss working together to open the government and deliver real results for the American people.
It was great to catch up with @JulieFineNBC5 about our first week in this new Congress working for you, including our resolution to protect Texans' health care against partisan attacks.
It was great to welcome so many North Texans into their Congressional office in Washington today. Thank you so much to everyone who stopped by our open house!
For us and for North Texans today was such a special day. I am honored to serve the community I grew up in.We welcome everyone to our new office in Washington at Cannon 328. Follow along here on Twitter and on Facebook at for updates!
This resolution puts the U.S. House of Representatives, the People's House, back on the side of the people and protecting their health care.
On my first day in Congress, I'm proud to lead the charge against this partisan lawsuit attacking Americans’ health care. We will not stand idly by while special interest forces and their allies in Washington look to rip away health care from millions of hard-working Americans.
