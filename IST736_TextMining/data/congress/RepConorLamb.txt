At legion posts, at union halls and on people’s doorsteps in #PA18, we found a faith in America and a fierce determination to make our institutions work again, as they have so often in our history.

It is a tremendous honor to take the oath to represent the people of #PA18 in Congress. Thank you for putting your faith trust in me.
