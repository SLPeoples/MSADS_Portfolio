The passage of this landmark legislation is a bold step toward restoring our democracy so that we have a government that works ‘For the People.’
I applaud the passage of H.R. 1, The ‘For the People’ Act. This legislation gives the American people the power to more freely exercise their constitutional right to vote, and it strengthens accountability for Executive Branch officials—including the President.
While we celebrate, we must also look toward the future and continue to fight for policies that will guarantee women equality in pay, access to healthcare, and protection against sexual violence. #InternationalWomensDay
Today, on International Women’s Day, we celebrate and honor women for their hard-won achievements throughout history.

“The American People deserve a Chief Executive who puts their needs—and the needs of the nation—first.  I hope and pray that President Trump will fulfill this charge going forward.”
“The President seems to believe that because Congress must legislate, we should not investigate.  Of course, the Constitution requires us to do both.  That is exactly how it works."
Tonight, President Trump tried to strike a reconciliatory note that has not been supported by his actions.My full statement on the President’s State of the Union:
Congratulations to Rosalind Brewer for being named to @Amazon’s board. Ms. Brewer will be the only African American member of the board, will become the 4th woman on the 10 member board. I applaud Amazon for taking concrete steps toward promoting diversity from the top.

“Remember education is the greatest investment you can have. Period.”
“The main thing is the bill makes it easier for the students to fill out the FAFSA form and get student aid.”
“We are here today to introduce the FAFSA Fairness Act, a bill that simplifies and reforms the complicated process these students that have no contact with their parents face.”
“By completing the FAFSA form students can ensure that they are taking advantage of all the financial aid options available to them.”
“It’s one thing to have opportunity, another thing to know about it, and another thing to reach it.”
“When I was younger I realized my only escape out of poverty was through education...and that education has taken me far.”
Was at @BMORECCC today to reintroduce the FAFSA Fairness Act.
Every February, our nation celebrates the contributions that African Americans have made to America. This #BlackHistoryMonth, I look forward to celebrating these contributions, reflecting on our past, and remembering that African American history is American history.

Dr. King engaged in the never-ending work of perfecting our Democracy, and he called upon our nation to offer far more opportunity and hope to all the Americans who – regardless of their racial background– were being disparaged and dismissed by our society.
Today, we honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  We remember the man whose calling led him to tirelessly promote political, economic, and social justice for all Americans.
I look forward to continuing our work together to further develop sustainable initiatives to help African American males achieve their God-given destinies and resolve their problems without violence.
Thank you @MayorPugh50, Dr. Bundley and the Mayor's Office of African American Male Engagement, and the many support organizations who helped organize and assisted with yesterday's CONNECT event.
Mr. President, before you proceed with discussions to protect the border and DREAMers you must first open the government, and ensure that the more than 800,000 federal employees who have already missed one paycheck do not miss another. #EndTheShutdown

I urge Leader McConnell to bring these measures up for a vote in the Senate, and for President Trump to work with Congress to allow the government to get back to work in service to the American people.
I am proud to have voted for each of the eight measures Democrats in the House of Representatives brought to the floor to end the shutdown and provide funding to government agencies.
I am glad to have voted to pass legislation to provide federal employees with back pay once the shutdown ends, but that does little to alleviate the pain of our nation’s public servants who went from living paycheck to paycheck, to paycheck to no check.
The more than 23,000 Maryland-based federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay have already missed one paycheck, and are now forced to contemplate the possibility of going an entire month – or even longer –  without pay.
Every day the shutdown continues, the pain felt by the over 800,000 affected federal workers only increases as anxieties about how to pay rent, cover medical expenses, and provide for their families deepen.
The American people deserve to have their government back at work for them, and federal employees deserve their pay.  Our government must be better than this.
On the 26th day of the Trump shutdown, I again voted to end the shutdown and fund government agencies. This shutdown has gone on for far too long.Read my full statement:

Allowing discrimination and harassment to go unchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of those who are interested in government service.
This bill will give federal interns the same protections already provided to federal employees. This is a great start, but more must be done. I urge my colleagues to also support the Unpaid Intern Protection Act, which would give interns outside of government similar protections.
The act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of race, religion, age, or sex is not currently prohibited by federal law. Under existing law, victims rely on the discretion and integrity of managers to prevent this behavior.
I am pleased that the House passed my bill, the Federal Intern Protection Act, to close a loophole in federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns open to discrimination and sexual harassment without any legal

Because of the Trump shutdown, thousands of families are at risk of being evicted from their homes as @HUDgov cannot renew low-income housing contracts. And, @HUDgov's Real Estate Assessment Center is not conducting inspections, putting the health and safety of tenants at risk.
As the Trump shutdown continues in its 20th day, federal food assistance programs – including WIC, school breakfast and lunch programs, the Emergency Food Assistance Program, and SNAP – are in peril, potentially leaving millions with the fear of going hungry.
