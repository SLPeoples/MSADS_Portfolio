I had a great time at the @blackexposouth Economic Empowerment Summit. The Summit provides a opportunity for Minority owned businesses to network with major corporations and showcase their products.
Thankful to count @RepSherrill, @RepSlotkin, @RepHoulahan, and @RepSpanberger as colleagues AND friends this #InternationalWomensDay
On #IWD2019 we honor the women who have changed our lives - our leaders, teachers, artists, politicians, family members, caretakers, and mentors. We remind ourselves that everyone is created equal and we commit ourselves to creating a world where that is realized.
We all know our political system is broken. Politicians have created a system that works for themselves and no one else. Well today, the House just took a major step to fix Washington by voting YES on #HR1
��️ Flash: When special interests and big corporations can buy influence, the government no longer serves you. Today, were voting on #HR1, which ends the dominance of big money in politics.
�ICYMI
Through legislation and everyday interactions, I hope we can always meet violence and fear with overpowering kindness and strength. #Selma
RT @RepDonBeyer: In this hearing on North Atlantic right whales, @RepCunningham just tried to get an Administration official to admit seism…
Today, I used an airhorn to demonstrate how disruptive seismic airgun blasting is to marine life. It was LOUD. Now imagine that sound 16,000x louder, repeated every 10 seconds for months, when you depend on sound to communicate/navigate. That's what seismic airgun blasting does.
It's not �science  - public servants should actually serve the public. #HR1 prohibits Members of Congress from serving on corporate boards and stops the revolving door between public service and special interests.
I will continue to ask these tough questions and hold BOEM accountable. South Carolina’s coastline is too important to risk.
The Taylor oil spill after Hurricane Ivan, which continues to leak to this day, is another example. BOEM tried to justify this as a 'small' oil spill. All I have to say is that, to South Carolinians, there are no small oil spills.
The acting director of BOEM claimed that they have not seen a Hurricane cause a major oil spill, ignoring the 8 million gallons spilled by Hurricane Katrina and the 336,000 gallon spill caused by Hurricane Sandy.
I had a few questions for @BOEM about their plans for drilling off South Carolina’s coast. There's no existing onshore infrastructure to support drilling in South Carolina, so a significant footprint would have to be created, which they didn't want to admit.
My staff will be hosting office hours this Friday at the Goose Creek Library from 1:30PM-2:30PM. If you need help with a Social Security claim, VA issue, or any other concerns, please stop by.
There are only two VA OBGYNs for female veterans in the entire state of South Carolina - a real barrier preventing them from accessing the benefits and healthcare they deserve. Today, I asked what we can do about it.
Analysis shows that because of the Charleston Loophole, 276,000 firearms were sold in 2018 without a completed background check. The Senate needs to pass our legislation to close the Charleston loophole and give law enforcement the time it needs.
�️�️ Our democracy is under attack by politicians who are making it harder for people to vote while simultaneously gerrymandering districts. Voters should pick their politicians, NOT the other way around.  #HR1 protects your right to vote and I'm proud to support it.
Iraq and Afghanistan vets are developing rare and fatal diseases likely due to their exposure to toxic burn pits. The Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act will help us gather research to ensure they receive the answers and treatment they are owed. I urge my colleagues to support it!
We're voting on #HR1 this week, the most sweeping anti-corruption legislation in my lifetime. Elected officials should work for YOU, not special interests and big corporations. This bill: ️Protects your right to vote ️ Ends the dominance of big money️Tackles corruption

In the Lowcountry, we treasure our #PublicLands and want them protected. Today, I'm voting YES to permanently reauthorize #LWCF so generations of South Carolinians can continue to enjoy the great outdoors.
In Charleston, and in too many other communities across the country, we must live every day with the pain of a gun violence tragedy. This week, I urge my colleagues to help spare future communities by closing the Charleston Loophole.

“I am made of puzzle pieces.” Last night, Joshua shared his story here in Washington D.C. Joshua has overcome obstacles, works 60+ hours while in school, and proudly represents our home of Charleston. We are honored to share his story #WhatWeAreMadeOf
I applaud @RepJoeWilson for taking this stand. Happy to see the positions of our delegation are starting to reflect the consensus in South Carolina. South Carolinians stand united in opposition to offshore drilling.
Global warming is the greatest non-military threat facing our nation. It's clear that there is a consensus among Americans that climate change is not a hoax.  Now we in government need to act.
On this day of national unity I had the honor to participate in the @YWCAChasSC MLK Day parade.  As Martin Luther King Jr once said, " We may have all came on different ships, but we are in the same boat now." #MLKDay
Today we honor the life legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. During this time of major contention throughout our nation, we should look at Dr. King as a guide. From expanding voter participation to ensuring equal rights for all, we still have much to do to carry out his legacy.
The House has passed 8 bills that would reopen government and the Senate has refused to vote on any of them. It’s time for the Senate to do its job and pass a bill to end this shutdown so we can get to work on a real immigration solution.
I am glad to see the President express willingness to negotiate on real immigration reform. But we can’t bring both sides together to find a bipartisan solution that ensures border security and upholds our values while the govt is closed and American families are hurting.
Many people view MLK weekend as a "day off" but I view it as a "day on". I began my MLK weekend of service by helping @seaislandHFH build a home for a family in need.
This afternoon I had the opportunity to speak with furloughed Federal employees and hear how the government shutdown has impacted their lives. Federal workers should not bear the burden for government dysfunction.

Tonight I voted for emergency disaster relief funding for Americans affected by recent natural disasters. We are still recovering from recent hurricanes and we need to make a serious investment in technology and infrastructure to make the Lowcountry more resilient in the future.
Any step towards offshore drilling is a step in the wrong direction. This Administration’s first priority should be ending the government shutdown, not pursuing dangerous and unwanted seismic air gun blasting.
Members of Congress should be receiving their first paychecks on February 1st. I believe it is unacceptable for Members of Congress to get paid when we haven't done our job and have asked the House Administrator to withhold my paycheck until the shutdown is over.
Since then, the House has continued to act, passing multiple individual appropriation bills to re-open vital government agencies. Still the Senate refuses to act.  The fundemental job of Congress is to pass a budget and fund the government.
On my very first day in office,  I passed bipartisan legislation to re-open the government. Legislation that the Senate unanimously passed last month. But now they refuse to do the same.
Today is the 26th day of the government shutdown. Federal workers have missed paychecks and for the first time ever, servicemembers of the U.S. Coast Guard will not be paid. It is unconscionable.
Today I spoke on the House floor in support of H.R. 41, to denounce the racist remarks of Rep. Steve King and condemn white supremacy and white nationalism in all forms. We must strongly condemn hateful expressions of intolerance wherever and whenever we see them.
I join @WhipClyburn in denouncing these racist and hateful remarks. Hate has no home in America, and certainly not in the halls of Congress.

Today marks the longest government shutdown in American history and I joined @WCBD to talk about it. On my first day on the job, I voted for a bipartisan series of bills that would reopen the government. I’ll continue to push the Senate to do their job.
Paying the brave men and women who put their lives in harms way to keep our coastlines safe should never be a partisan issue. Yesterday I cosponsored the Pay our Coast Guard Parity Act to ensure active and reserve members get paid.
Making friends when you’re a freshman is hard and I thought I’d grease the skids with some Lowcountry beer. Thankfully @RepPeterDeFazio got it in the end! Can I join the beer caucus now?

I made a promise to my constituents that, if elected, I would work to protect South Carolina's coastlines from offshore drilling. That's why I just introduced my first piece of legislation to ban offshore drilling off the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts.

Honored to be joined by a bipartisan group of local lawmakers and environmental groups as I announce my plans to introduce the Coastal Economies Protection Act which will place a 10 year ban on offshore drilling off the Atlantic Coast.
I have a very important announcement I'd love to share with y'all. Please tune into my Facebook live at 9:30 AM this morning to find out!
South Carolina cannot afford the risk. Our beaches, businesses, and way of life are not for sale. That’s why I’m not just saying no to offshore drilling, I’m saying hell no to offshore drilling.
Deepwater Horizon caused the loss of 11 lives, $62 billion, 10 million user-days of beach, fishing, and boating access, and its impact on fisheries could total almost $9 billion by 2020.
And this dangerous process doesn’t even prove oil deposits exist! Companies still must drill test wells to confirm deposits and determine �. Remember, the Deepwater Horizon tragedy occurred during the tapping of an exploratory well.
Since most marine life depend on sound to communicate/navigate, blasts can disrupt basic survival functions. Noise from just ONE airgun can kill off zooplankton, the organism that underpins the entire marine food chain.
Blasts need to be loud enough to travel the miles between the ocean floor and a ship - which means they can be heard underwater from about the distance between LA and NYC!
But even before you get to the drilling stage, companies must search for oil and gas deposits buried deep under the ocean floor thru a process called seismic airgun blasting�. This is an extremely loud and disruptive process.
Since 2001, the offshore oil industry has had more than 589 reported oil spills!
You hear a lot about offshore drilling, but have you ever wondered why exactly it’s so harmful? I’m glad you asked! As a former ocean engineer, I know  how destructive drilling for oil can be to a coastline. Even a small leak can destroy our beaches, economy, and way of life.
Looking forward to it!
