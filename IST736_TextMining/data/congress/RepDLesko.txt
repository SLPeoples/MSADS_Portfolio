Although this saddens me, I hope my colleagues will work with me in a bipartisan fashion to reauthorize such an important law for so many women and children in America very soon.
As a survivor of domestic violence, I am deeply saddened that the Violence Against Women Act will expire tonight, at midnight. Rather than supporting my clean extension of the existing law, Democrats voted last night to allow these programs and services to lapse.

While I appreciate the hard work of my colleagues, I couldn't vote for a funding bill that contains too many restrictions that may prevent the border fence from being built, ties the hands of law enforcement potentially reduces the # of detention beds for criminals.
I will support President @realDonaldTrump’s use of his executive authority to end this crisis if he chooses to do so. This threat to our national security is a national emergency and we must take action.
We can no longer deny the crisis that is happening at our border. Although there’s been some movement to provide additional resources for border security, it is simply not enough to address the human trafficking, drug smuggling, and illegal immigration taking over our border.
Heartbreaking news out of India today. I'm praying for the family and loved ones of the victims of today's terrorist attack. We must stand united against terrorism all over the world. #KashmirTerrorAttack
