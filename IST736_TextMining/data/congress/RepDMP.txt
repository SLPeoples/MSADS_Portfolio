My team had a great time this morning walking/jogging with the Hammocks @MiamiDadePD. It’s great to see our officers strengthening ties to the community and promoting a healthy lifestyle. #HealthyCommunities
@RepKatieHill @RepUnderwood @LaurenCoat Love this pic! Love you both! ️
Es increíble ver como personas inocentes pagan las consecuencias del régimen ilegítimo de #Maduro, ignorante y completamente cruel. Mi corazón está con las familias venezolanas que sufren estos crímenes inauditos! #VenezuelaLibreYa
When I had time, I spent quality time with Siena showing her around DC and introducing her to my friends in Congress. We are excited to be back home in Miami tonight!
- Met with Claim Your Vote to discuss voter suppression, maternal depression, and slowing climate change.- Discussed how to get an accurate and inclusive 2020 census with NALEO.
- Discussed the coral reef restoration with the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation. The Florida Reef in the Keys is the only living coral barrier reef in continental U.S.

In Congress I…- Voted YES to strengthen voting rights, take dark money out of politics, and make sure elected officials work for the American people.
I got to spend the first full week of #WomensHistoryMonth with my daughter, Siena, shadowing me in Congress! I was a very proud mom watching her confidently introduce herself to my colleagues and fit her school work into our busy schedule. Read more in my #WeeklyWrapUp...
.@AmaraLaNegraALN is standing up for Afro-Latinas. She is advancing the much-needed dialogue around the racism the Afro-Latina community faces every day. #WomensDay #LatinaPower
As chair of the @HispanicCaucus Women’s Taskforce, I’m excited to highlight women embodying #LatinaPower… like @Emma4Change. She survived the Parkland shooting, is confronting the NRA, and fighting to end mass shootings. #WomensDay #NeverAgain
On International #WomensDay, I’m celebrating by listening to a few of my favorite #GirlPower songs! Here’s my playlist…
I am so proud to have my daughter with me in DC on #InternationalWomensDay! When a door opens up, you make sure lots of other women walk through after you, too! #LatinaPower
Did you know Miami is the only major American city founded by a woman? Our community has deep #GirlPower roots! Happy #InternationalWomensDay to Julia DeForest Tuttle, #MotherOfMiami.
My colleagues and I represent a record 131 women in the House and Senate! We are lawyers, mothers, scientists, advocates, health care professionals, and mothers. We wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the trailblazing women who came before us! #InternationalWomensDay #GirlPower
Happy #InternationalWomensDay to my fellow Congresswomen! We are working together to empower women and girls through affordable health care, protections for DREAMers, paid family leave policies, and more!
By continuing to strengthen voting rights, prevent voter purging – which my bill addresses – and take dark money out of our political system, Floridians can know that their government will work for them. A strong and healthy democracy is not a partisan issue. #ForThePeople
Washington has become increasingly focused on serving the needs of the privileged and the powerful, while drowning out the voices and interests of South Floridians. The #ForThePeople Act takes on the power special interests have had on our government.
Strong democracy shouldn’t be a partisan issue. Today, we fulfilled our promise to clean up Washington’s #CultureOfCorruption and pass #HR1. It will help deliver what the American people want: a government #ForThePeople.
Last week, I introduced an essential part of the #ForThePeople agenda--a bill to prohibit voter roll purging through a tactic known as voter caging. Did you know you could get purged from the voting rolls if your mail isn’t delivered to you?
These sweeping reforms have been through several committee hearings to ensure #HR1 works #ForThePeople. In the @HouseJudiciary hearing, I discussed the absolute necessity of protecting the #VotingRightsAct to ensure an individual’s right to vote is not impeded.
We’re about to pass some MAJOR reforms to our government #ForThePeople. Not since Watergate have these reforms to public service and voting been passed, and we’ve been working on it since Day
This morning, I stood with @RepBenRayLujan, @RepCicilline, @RepDWStweets, and @NydiaVelazquez supporting #HR1. We need the government to work #ForThePeople!
Americans MUST have faith in their government. We’re voting to strengthen voting rights, take dark money out of politics, and make sure elected officials work #ForThePeople! #HR1
On International #WomensDay, my colleagues and I couldn’t agree more that a woman’s place is in the House … of Representatives!
Thank you @NALEO for meeting with me in DC today to discuss the census. #Census2020 is the foundation of our democracy. I’m fighting to get an accurate and inclusive census to ensure minority communities aren’t left behind. #Make2020Count
VAWA is absolutely necessary: it provides life-saving protections for victims of domestic violence, including children, the LGBTQ community Native Americans. Shortly after I stressed the importance of #VAWA at @HouseJudiciary, it was re-introduced. And it must be reauthorized.
I am actively working to find solutions to fix South Florida’s water problems. We have flooding, algae blooms, leaky septic tanks, and communities without clean drinking water. Today, I asked questions on @TransportDems to learn more about solving problems. #InvestingInWater
#LatinosInSTEM create life-changing solutions that will help our country succeed. We need #equalpay to encourage more women and women of color to pursue STEM careers. Representation matters!
There's a humanitarian and political crisis in Venezuela.I sponsored a bill in the House to grant Venezuelans TPS.There's now a bill in the Senate.How much more is there for @POTUS to review? Mr. President, put actions behind your words!
Yo patrociné una propuesta de ley para otorgar TPS a los venezolanos.Hay una propuesta en el Senado.Apoyamos al pueblo venezolano y es hora que @POTUS haga lo mismo! #SOSVenezuela #VenezuelaLibreYa
It’s shocking that we have to suffer broken and leaky sewage lines disrupting our day-to-day lives in South Florida. This is the #CostOfInaction. Today, I’m talking clean water with @TransportDems! #investinginwater
Our immigration system is broken. Yesterday, I promised DACA and TPS recipients that I won’t stop fighting for them. They are people. They are Americans. They deserve to not live in fear. #ProtectTheDream
After hours of following me around, sitting through hearings, helping me take notes, and presiding over the House floor, we were done! And since no one was found walking the halls at night, cartwheels were in order!
Glad to see @coweddle released, but Maduro's dangerous human rights abuses continue. We can't stop supporting Venezuela peacefully restoring its democracy and increase American humanitarian aid. #SOSVenezuela
South Florida is already seeing the drastic effects of climate change: crumbling coastlines, extreme hurricanes, and sweltering summers will only get worse if we do not #ActOnClimate now! I’m taking action on @HouseNewDems Climate Change Task Force
DACA recipients are helping our country lead in science, technology, and medicine. They are our neighbors. They are entrepreneurs, college graduates, educators, and health care providers. They are mothers, fathers, and children. I won’t stop fighting to #ProtectTheDream.
Jorge adds to our economy and community just like anyone else. A path to citizenship for DACA and TPS recipients, like Jorge, would add $1.2 billion annually to Florida’s economy. It isn’t just the economical thing to do--it is the moral thing to do. #ProtectTheDream #ProtectTPS
For his entrepreneurship and leadership, Jorge was awarded the keys to both Miami-Dade County and the City of Miami. Dreamers are making great strides for this country. I am fighting to #ProtectTheDream because our country will succeed when DACA and TPS aren’t in legal limbo.
Jorge Cortes came to the US when he was only a teenager. Now, after working hard and graduating from @FIU, he is a successful entrepreneur in Miami’s technology and social innovation sector. He grew up and started his career here. Miami is his home. #ProtectTheDream
It was incredibly emotional to speak on the Floor about DACA TPS as a member of South Florida’s immigrant community. DACA TPS recipients in #FL26 have grown roots here. Now, Trump is leaving them terrified about their future--worried they could be deported. #ProtectTheDream
I’ve been participating in discussions about DACA, TPS, and immigration reform all day. These conversations are important and help move our country forward. That is why I am truly honored to preside over the @HispanicCaucus special order hour led by @RepEspaillat on DACA and TPS.
Our district’s economy would lose $92,500,000 EVERY YEAR if all working DACA recipients were removed. DACA isn’t just the right thing to do for our economy--it is the moral thing to do. #ProtectTheDream #FL26
In Florida, TPS holders pay $117.4 million in state and local taxes. Our economy would suffer a tremendous amount if we were to lose all TPS recipients. We need each and every TPS and DACA holder. #ProtectTPS
There are DACA and TPS recipients in our community studying to be doctors and provide health care services greatly needed in #FL26. Today, I met a young TPS recipient who wants to be an attorney. Others are business leaders. They’re as American as us. #ProtectTPS #ProtectTheDream
There are 44,800 TPS holders and 32,795 DACA recipients in Florida. They are our neighbors, our friends, and our colleagues. They have placed their roots here, and as far as I’m concerned, they are Americans. #ProtectTPS
Did you know 37,200 children in FL live in a household where a family member holds TPS? I’m honored to preside over the special order hour today led by @RepEspaillat to highlight how TPS and DACA protect Americans all over the country. #ProtectTheDream
I’m about to preside on the floor! This Latina immigrant is honored to be presiding over the @HispanicCaucus special order on immigration led by @RepEspaillat! #ProtectTheDream #ProtectTPS
A free press is a foundation for democracy. We can’t let Maduro attack human rights, much less the rights of an American citizen. Maduro, release him now. #VenezuelaLibreYa
La prensa libre es la fundación de una democracia. No podemos permitir que Maduro ataque los derechos humanos y mucho menos de un ciudadano americano. Maduro, suéltalo ahora. #VenezuelaLibreYa
To DACA and TPS recipients: The economic impact would be tremendously negative if you were to one day leave. We need each and every one of you, and we will do everything in our power to make sure we can provide a safe place for you because you are American. #ProtectTheDream
We have so many members of our community who are right now studying to be doctors, providing health care services that are so greatly needed in my community. They are teachers, parents, business owners. #ProtectTheDream
This is an emotional issue. I’m an immigrant and we have a large population of DACA and TPS recipients in my district who right now are living in limbo. They have placed their roots here in this country--as far as I’m concerned, they are as American as any of us. #ProtectTheDream
Today, I met people who have been here most of their lives. They are helping our communities as teachers, professors, coaches, and parents. This is their home. Our economy relies on them, and protecting them is the right thing to do. We must #ProtectTheDream and #ProtectTPS.
RT @TheMiamiTimes: STOP THE VIOLENCE: Local, state and nationally elected officials addressed the rash of shootings happening in South Dade…
Too many lives have been lost to the scourge of gun violence in South Florida. I am proud we took action by passing monumental gun reform in the House, but that was just one step. I won’t stop fighting to #EndGunViolence.
Today, @HouseJudiciary is holding a hearing on DACA and TPS. Protecting Dreamers and TPS recipients isn’t just the right thing to do for our economy--it is the moral thing to do. #ProtectTPS #CleanDreamActNow. Watch live here:
On my way to #ProtectTPS, fight for a #cleandreamactnow with my daughter Siena!Cc: @HouseJudiciary
Are you visiting the beach? Be on the lookout for nesting sea turtles! Florida is home to about 90 percent of sea turtles nesting in the US. Read this article to learn how to protect our unique wildlife. #FL26 #SaveTheTurtles
Miami is a unique place. I love our #305. ¡Dale! #305Day
For every $1 white men made in 2017, AAPI women made 85 cents. For some AAPI ethnic subgroups this gap is even wider. That’s unacceptable!We need #AAPIEqualPay, and we need paycheck fairness for all women. #WomensHistoryMonth
Want big money out of politics?Want fair elections?Want public servants to serve the American people, not themselves or special interests?I know that those back home in Florida do! That’s why I’m voting to pass the #ForThePeople Act later this week. #FL26
When Congress prioritizes safeguarding workers’ rights, increasing wages, lowering health and prescription drug costs, rebuilding America, and protecting the environment, our middle class becomes stronger. Let’s make our government work
The #ForThePeople bill includes my bill to prohibit voter roll purging through a tactic known as voter caging. Voter caging can prevent citizens from voting just because mail is undeliverable! This dishonest practice is an attempt to suppress democracy.
 Restores ethics and integrity to public service.
� Makes it easier – not harder – to vote.
� Reduces the role of dark, special interest money in politics.
The #ForThePeople Act puts power back in the hands of the American people. Here’s what it does …
This week, Democrats are voting to reject the #CultureOfCorruption in Washington and restore transparency and accountability to our government. Public servants must serve the American people, not special interests. #HR1 #ForThePeople
Floridians know too well the heartbreak Alabama is going through today. My heart goes out to them. Let’s help them recover as quickly as possible. #AlabamaTornadoes
Rebekah Garcia is a sophomore at @FIU at our district office. After voting for the first time in 2018, Rebekah knew she could do more to help other young people get involved. Thanks to Rebekah and our whole team who help empower our community! #FL26 #WomensHistoryMonth
Griselda Lopez is also a senior at @FIU at our district office. As an immigrant from Mexico, she hopes to bring awareness to other Americans about the daily hardships immigrants face. Thanks for all you do for South Florida, Griselda! #FL26 #WomensHistoryMonth
Ana Montes is a senior at @FIU at our district office. She’s a Cuban immigrant is passionate about issues affecting Latinos in South Florida. She arrived to the US the day President Obama was re-elected, which she says sparked her interest in politics. #FL26 #WomensHistoryMonth
In honor of #WomensHistoryMonth, I will be highlighting strong women in my life and in history. I am surrounded by so much #GirlPower when I’m in the office, I wanted to start by highlighting some of the women on our team. See below:
Even in dark times, there are people who provide our world with hope and light. We need more Nora Sandigos in the world. #ReuniteFamilies #ChildrenNotCriminals #WomensHistoryMonth
Glad to see Maduro didn’t attempt to arrest @JGuaido when he returned home. Venezuela needs a peaceful restoration of its democracy. Locking up political opponents illegally isn’t the way. #VenezuelaLibreYa
#OTD in 1913 organized labor’s fight to have a voice in the Cabinet led to the establishment of @USDOL. It’s more important than ever to ensure the Labor Dept. is advocating for #equalpay, #workersrights, safe working conditions equal opportunities.
When I worked at @zoomiami, we invested in conservation and education. Now, I’m working on @TransportDems to protect Florida’s unique wildlife from the threats of climate change so future generations can enjoy them as much as us. #WorldWildlifeDay
Yes @RepLucyMcBath our strength lies in our unity and commitment to all American families! But the best part is the friendship we’re forming ️#WomensHistoryMonth2019
#ICYMI Friday, I stood with local leaders to discuss the life-saving gun reform we passed in the House. It's time we address local gun violence with action. I will keep working on @HouseJudiciary to come up with commonsense solutions to make our community safer. #HonorWithAction
Happy Birthday to our beautiful Sunshine State! #OTD Florida became the 27th state in the US. There is no better place to call home! #FloridaStatehoodDay
Seguiremos apoyando al gobierno de @jguaido para que los venezolanos puedan restaurar la democracia. Gracias Ecuador por apoyar una transición pacífica!
I am heartbroken that the same country that welcomed my family and me is separating children from their families and loved ones so cruelly. Seeking asylum is legal, and families belong together. #ReunifyFamilies
What’s taking @POTUS so long to grant Venezuelans TPS? Back up your tough words with actions, Mr. President. #SOSVenezuela
I am excited to spend some time with my family this weekend before going back to DC to work for South Florida! #FL26
In the district I…- Stood with local leaders to honor those we’ve lost to gun violence, and the lives we will save when the bills we passed this week become law.- Met with local leaders and city staffers in Homestead to discuss community development.
- Met with Citizens Trade Campaign (CTC), a national coalition of labor, consumer, environmental, faith, family farm, and other civil society groups with field staff across the country to discuss the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
- Met with Debbie's Dream, the Stomach Cancer Advocacy Group to discuss stomach cancer funding and research.
- Met with Newtown Action Alliance to discuss prioritizing gun reform in the 116th Congress.
- Met with the Florida Council of the Blind to discuss how we can expand access to autonomous vehicles, durable medical equipment, and low vision aid expansion.
- Discussed FEMA and storm restoration, municipal bonds, and environmental regulations to keep our community safe with the Municipal Electric Utilities representatives from the Keys and Homestead.
With constituents I …- Met with my Democrat and Republican colleagues from Florida to discuss the water quality issues facing our state.
- Signed a letter urging the Interior Dept. to prevent offshore drilling off the coast of Florida.- Signed a letter calling on Justice Dept. to re-open and make public the plea agreement Labor Sec. Alex Acosta made with serial sexual abuser Jeffrey Epstein.
- Cosponsored legislation to protect consumers from being forced to forego their constitutional right to a trial by jury.
- Stood up to the Administration’s cruel policy of family separation at a Judiciary Committee hearing.
- Addressed a REAL emergency, climate change, at a Transportation Infrastructure Committee hearing.
- Voted YES to protect public lands like the Everglades and our beautiful state parks.
- Voted YES to close the Charleston Loophole. Under current law, if your background check takes more than 3 days, you’re automatically approved to purchase your firearm. If you haven’t completed a background check, you shouldn’t be able to purchase a firearm. Period.
- Voted YES for universal background checks and to close the gun show and internet sale loopholes.
- Voted to terminate the President’s Fake Emergency.
In Congress I…- Introduced a bill to prohibit voters being taken off voter rolls just because someone’s mail is undeliverable.
This week, we voted for sorely-needed change. For the first time in decades, we voted for commonsense gun reform and to protect our public lands, including the Everglades. Read more about what I did this week in my #weeklywrapup:
Had a great morning in Homestead discussing community development with local leaders and city staffers! These conversations are critical to building a stronger community. �
RT if you think it’s time for Congress to #ActOnClimate!
I am lucky to have grown up with a strong mother and three sisters who taught me the strength of Latinas, and I’m raising my daughters with the same #GirlPower mentality. As chair of the @HispanicCaucus’ Women’s Task Force, I am very excited to celebrate #WomensHistoryMonth!
No law is perfect, and no law will stop every death by gun violence, but that is no excuse for inaction. This week, we took the first step to curing our country of this epidemic. #EndGunViolence

After passing major gun reform this week to #EndGunViolence, I was proud to stand with @RepShalala, @MomsDemand, and other local leaders this morning to honor those we’ve lost, but also the lives these bills could save when they become law.
.@DHSgov extended TPS for people from Sudan, El Salvador, Haiti Nicaragua. This is a step in the right direction, but we must extend TPS to the Venezuelan people who are escaping an authoritarian regime and poverty. They need our help. #SaveTPS
Voter caging prevents citizens from voting through no fault of their own. My bill would prohibit the use of voter caging mail to disqualify voters in a federal election. This dishonest practice is an attempt to suppress democracy. It must be stopped. #ForThePeople
Did you know you could get dropped from the voter rolls for not receiving a piece of mail? Today, I introduced a bill to prohibit voter roll purging through this tactic known as voter caging. #ForThePeople

Let's do everything we can to make our communities safer for everyone and #EndGunViolence#HR1112 #CharlestonLoophole
FBI analysis of the current background check system shows that 3 business days isn't enough time to decide if someone shouldn’t be allowed to own a gun. #HR1112 gives them the time they need to conduct a thorough investigation.
In 2017, 6,004 background checks were denied after the initial 3-day waiting period.  #HR1112 would allow the FBI more time to run background checks so we can stop prohibited gun owners from slipping through the cracks.
The #CharlestonLoophole allows someone to purchase a firearm even if their background check has not been completed within the 3-day period.  This is dangerous and allows people with criminal backgrounds and mental illnesses to become gun
Americans overwhelmingly support background checks. Yet the #CharlestonLoophole allows someone to buy a firearm even if the background check hasn't been completed. I believe a gun sale shouldn't be made if the background check hasn't been completed. Period.#HR1112
Many of us carried pictures of gun violence victims with us today. It was a strong reminder of the lives we honored with our vote for universal background checks. I carried a photo of my father. #HonorWithAction #HR8 @MomsDemand @RepKClark @RepRobinKelly @RepBarragan
We were elected to bring bold leadership and change to Congress, just like we did today. We passed historic gun safety legislation in the House #ForThePeople! #HR8 @RepKClark @RepShalala @RepJerryNadler @RepRobinKelly

This bill may not prevent every death by gun violence, but that is no excuse for inaction. In honor of my father and every South Florida family affected by gun violence, I am proud to vote for the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.Full statement &gt;
In the face of an epidemic that had been ravaging our country and South Florida, Congress remained silent, action-less, and beholden to gun manufacturers.Today, we changed that.#HR8 #EndGunViolence #ForThePeople
Over a year ago, I met with parents who lost their kids in Parkland. I promised those parents, like Frank Guttenberg, and my community that I would be a voice to #EndGunViolence. My vote for commonsense gun reform is for those children and those parents.
With more than 90% of Americans supporting universal background checks, the vote today on #HR8 is #ForThePeople. We are passing commonsense gun reform to #EndGunViolence.
Romania Dukes suffered the unimaginable: the loss of a child. I believe my vote today on #HR8 for universal background checks will save lives, so fewer people will have to experience what Romania did. #EndGunViolence
Today, the House is making history by voting for universal background checks. It was an honor to work on this bill #ForThePeople with @HouseJudiciary, @RepJerryNadler @RepTedDeutch @RepLucyMcBath and many others. #HR8
As I vote to pass commonsense gun reform, I remember the phone call when I was 24 years old telling me that my father was shot and killed by a criminal with a gun. Sadly, too many Americans share the same story as mine. We can change that.
South Floridians know we are Ground Zero for the effects of climate change and sea level rise. In @TransportDems hearing, it was refreshing to not debate the science and focus on solutions. #ActOnClimate

Today, I was proud to vote to protect the beautiful #PublicLands in South Florida. We must ensure these places are protected for our kids and grandkids. #LWCF @EvergladesNPS @BiscayneNPS @DryTortugasNPS @USFWS @FLStateParks
I voted to terminate the President’s #FakeEmergency that would have diverted $220 million of military funding in Florida alone. We must focus on real emergencies, like climate change and gun violence.
I call on the Administration to be transparent and perform a thorough investigation, so we can know what exactly happened and what can be done to prevent this from happening in the future.
At #CHCatHomestead we were instructed not to speak to the children, but I went ahead spoke to them anyway. There are 144 kids housed in an area with numbers next to bunk beds. We are committing a crime against humanity. This is an America I do not recognize #EndFamilySeparation
In South Florida, we see the effects of rising temperature and more severe storms. Our roads, bridges, and coastlines are crumbling. We must #ActOnClimate to reduce carbon emissions and create resilient infrastructure.
While the President ignores democracy for a #FakeEmergency, I’m addressing a real emergency on @TransportDems: climate change. In #FL26, our coastlines are eroding because of rising sea levels. I’m asking questions about investing in carbon-reducing technologies. #ActOnClimate
When I visited Homestead detention facility I walked away with questions that still haven’t been answered. How many families were separated? What’s Trump’s plan to reunify every child with their loved ones? One thing is clear: we must
The process of separating children from their parents loved ones is cruel inhumane. This is not the America that I came to as a young girl looking for freedom opportunity. We cannot stand silent in the face of these injustices. #EndFamilySeparation
Antonio was escaping violence in El Salvador when he was separated from his mother at the border. Immigration officers told him he’d never see his mother again. They were eventually reunited, but Antonio says he will never be the same after that experience. #EndFamilySeparation
Today, I am sitting on @HouseJudiciary as a mother, as an immigrant, and as the voice for immigrants in my district and across the country. We must speak up against Trump’s cruel immigration policies that tear families apart. #EndFamilySeparation
Speaking on our agenda #forthepeople. After decades of inaction, we’re voting for commonsense gun safety, universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole, and the Charleston loophole. #enough #NeverAgain
La hipocresía de la Administración de Trump: dicen que apoyan a la comunidad venezolana, pero en vez de protegerlos con TPS, buscan deportarlos. Es por esto que debemos extender el TPS ahora. #VenezuelaLibreYa
For democracy to function, journalists need to be able to ask those in power tough questions — at home and abroad. Maduro, you can detain @JorgeRamosNews, but you can’t silence him.
This week, we're voting for commonsense gun reforms. Proud of all of my colleagues that have helped us take this important step to make our communities safer. #NeverAgain #Enoughcc: @RepLucyMcBath @RepJoeNeguse @RepSylviaGarcia
My heart is with @AndrewGillum and his entire family. Losing a father and a loved one is never easy. I know he will be missed.
Rising sea levels. Nuisance flooding. The effects of climate change have already started to take effect in South Florida. I am supporting the #GreenNewDeal because we cannot wait any longer for Congress to #ActOnClimateChange. #FL26 
This week, we are finally bringing commonsense gun reform to the House floor. This is personal for me, for my friend @RepLucyMcBath, and it should be a priority for every member who wants to make our communities safer. #EndGunViolence #HR8

And I signed a letter requesting President Trump immediately demand Secretary of Labor Alex Acosta’ resignation.
I signed a letter recommending the Senate Judiciary vote on the Inspector General Access Act, a bipartisan bill that would allow DOJ to investigate allegations of misconduct within the DOJ, such as allegations against Alex Acosta
I cosponsored a bill to repeal the “Cadillac Tax” on certain employer-sponsored health care plans....
In Congress, I...Cosponsored @JoaquinCastrotx's resolution to terminate the President’s unconstitutional national emergency. We are not letting @POTUS get away with this power grab that puts democracy at risk. We are voting on this resolution next week.
Beyond this emotional visit, I was able to spend my week in #FL26 with family and constituents. I met with local mayors to discuss working with @TransportDems to build reliable and resilient infrastructure. And I supported my son’s team in his soccer tournament! #WeeklyWrapUp
We held a roundtable discussion with advocates, activists, and family separation survivors. Next week, @HouseJudiciary is holding a hearing on Family Separation. I will hold those responsible for these actions accountable. #WeeklyWrapUp More here:

Great to meet with Florida City Mayor Otis Wallace and other local leaders to learn more about how we can bring transit solutions to our South Dade community. I will keep working on @TransportDems for reliant public transportation in #FL26.
We cannot be putting our drinking water and natural habitats at risk by drilling in the Everglades. I will keep fighting to protect the natural beauties of #FL26.
Yesterday’s visit to the Homestead detention center was a harsh reminder of what we are fighting for in Congress. I want to do everything I can to help those kids. #SocialJusticeDay #ChildrenNotCriminals
Yesterday my heart broke. In Homestead, the Trump Admin. is locking up kids that are around the same age I was when I immigrated to the US. We need to stay true to our American values and morals. These are #ChildrenNotCriminals.
As a mother, especially an immigrant mother, it was very hard to walk through the child detention center in Homestead. We must help these children. #ChildrenNotCriminals
ICYMI: Yesterday, I led a congressional visit to the Homestead Child Detention Center. I did not see criminals. I did not see gangs. I saw children who need to be reunited with loved ones. #ChildrenNotCriminals @RepShalala @JoaquinCastrotx @RepSylviaGarcia
For a #POTUS who denounces Maduro and pretends to show concern over an authoritarian regime he is following in his same footsteps attacking the media and violating the constitution. This is unacceptable and it is not how a free and strong democracy works. #Enough #SOSVenezuela

Thanks to those who joined us to discuss solutions to what we saw at the #CHCatHomestead visit. I’ll do everything I can in Congress to reunite families. @FLImmigrant @afsc_org @WeCount_Fl @CLSMiami@MexAmCouncil, Shutdown Tornillo Coalition, and family separation survivors.
Following the #CHCatHomestead visit, my colleagues and I sat down to discuss solutions with advocates, activists, and families impacted by the Trump Administration’s cruel immigrant agenda. Detaining children does not align with American values. #ChildrenNotCriminals

I just visited the migrant child detention facility in Homestead. I did not see criminals or gang members. I saw kids who have hope that this country would welcome them. I will do whatever possible in Congress to help reunite the kids with their families. #ChildrenNotCriminals

Sintonízate a @UniNoticias con Satcha Preto ahora! Discusión importante sobre mi visita al centro de detención @HHSGov en Homestead y más
We must stand up to the injustices we are seeing at these child detention centers--that’s why I’m leading a delegation to visit the Homestead facility. Shelters like this one are going completely unchecked. We are here to perform that check
We are asking the Trump administration to grant TPS to Venezuelans. It means nothing to say the Maduro Regime is illegitimate and at the same time deport Venezuelans to that country. #VenezuelaLibreYa #SOSVenezuela
On #PresidentsDay, let’s honor the great American leaders who worked to advance our country #ForThePeople.
Thousands of children in Florida without #healthcare is a #NationalEmergency.
