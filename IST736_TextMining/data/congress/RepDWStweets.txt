I'm proud to lead a Congressional delegation to Colombia this weekend joined by @RepShalala. We had a helpful, informative meeting with President @IvanDuque, discussing the crisis in Venezuela, getting humanitarian aid there and supporting interim President of Venezuela @jguaido
I am proud to support the brave trans individuals that serve our country. I cosponsored H.Res. 124, led by @RepJoeKennedy, opposing the ban on service in the Armed Forces by openly trans individuals #IWD2019
Women still make only 80 cents on avg for every dollar earned by a man – and this is even worse for women of color. We must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, sponsored by @Rosa_DeLauro, to stand up for women, children, and working families by striving to end the wage gap #IWD2019
Combating Sexual Harassment in Science Act sponsored by @RepEBJ would address sexual harassment in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields by supporting sexual harassment research and efforts to prevent and respond to sexual harassment. #IWD2019
The Protecting Domestic Violence and Stalking Victims Act, sponsored by @RepAnthonyBrown, would protect more victims of domestic violence by preventing their abusers from possessing or receiving firearms #IWD2019
The Zero Tolerance for Domestic Abusers Act, introduced by @RepDebDingell, would protect victims of stalking from gun violence and close the “boyfriend loophole” which still allows abusive dating partners to obtain a gun #IWD2019
The Expanded Stalking Protections Act of 2019, sponsored by @RepGraceMeng, would provide protection to help protect friends and co-workers of stalking victims from violence #IWD2019
The #FAMILYAct, which would create a national #paidleave program to guarantee #paidleave for moms and dads (and many others!) while shifting #caregiving norms and making workplaces more equitable and family friendly.  #IWD2019
H.R.1468, sponsored by @RepRoybalAllard, would promote the economic security and safety of survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking #IWD2019
The #EMPOWERAct sponsored by @KamalaHarris @lisamurkowski @RepLoisFrankel takes on all types of harassment in the workplace. It limits the use of mandatory NDAs that prevent people from speaking up and requires public companies to report info about harassment to the SEC #IWD2019
One of my top priorities in Congress is to make sure we change our laws to advance justice and equity for women. On #InternationalWomensDay I want to highlight legislation we're already working on, this Congress, to support that goal – and we’re only getting started. #IWD2019

The Trump Administration owes Congress answers - we need to know how many families were separated and their plan to reunify every child with their loved ones. It’s time to end this cruel, government-sanctioned child abuse. #EndFamilySeparation
Privatization is not the answer to improving @DeptVetAffairs. We must increase access and quality, not degrade care for our #Veterans. @SecWilkie said he opposes privatization at his confirmation, but I'm concerned at signs the VA is moving in that direction.
I was horrified to read the @washingtonpost article “The Parking Lot Suicides” which details 19 suicides that occurred on VA campuses from Oct 2017 to Nov 2018, 7 of them in parking lots. The most recent parking lot suicide was in my home state of Florida.

The inability to access or afford menstrual products, known as ‘period poverty,’ has a wide ranging impact, from leading girls to miss school to creating   significant health risks. Florida is among a majority of states that have abolished the sales tax on menstrual products.

The Members’ Representational Allowance (MRA) provides funding for U.S. House offices to purchase office necessities. Items like “executive tissue holders” have qualified for MRA funding. Yet last year a U.S. Representative was told tampons do NOT qualify.

No experts have identified an actual security crisis at the border. The President is using his #SOTU platform to advance a manufactured crisis. His rhetoric and resulting policies will not make our nation safer - but will put refugees seeking haven in our country at risk.

As the chair of the Appropriations subcommittee that oversees funding for the VA and military construction, I know the critical projects which would have their funding put at risk if the President declares a national emergency tonight. #SOTU
I joined @RepTedDeutch to talk about the #PACTAct, a bipartisan effort to #ProtectOurPets. The federal government must take this seriously, for the sake of animal rights and public safety. Thanks @senatornanrich @browardsheriff @humanenbroward and @HumaneSociety for teaming up.
History left untold, is history erased. We must highlight the untold stories that show the work, ingenuity, strength, resilience and power of black people – who traveled to unfamiliar destinations for a better life for their families themselves.#BlackHistoryMonth
Finally!Voters elected @HouseDemocrats to take action on America's gun violence epidemic. This is what Democracy looks like.  #HR8
When we stand together, we can do anything! It’s been 10 years since the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law – but we're not done. It’s time to make #EqualPay the law of the land, and pass the #PaycheckFairness Act!
In Washington, we are united behind a free and democratic #Venezuela. Proud to stand with interim President Juan Guaido’s Chargé d’Affaires of the Government of Venezuela, Carlos Alfredo Vecchio.
Proud of my #sistersurvivor, @repgwenmoore for bravely sharing her battle with #cancer. Thankful she is in remission. She has been there for me and I will be there for her. Cancer doesn’t know who it’s messing with! #beatcancer
Families of all sizes were financially hurt by the #TrumpShutdown, including the @USCG members we count on to protect our borders. I met with Coast Guard families today who felt that pain, and for them, I’ll do all I can to avoid another needless, painful shutdown.
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay we honor millions of Jews and other victims murdered in history's worst genocide. This atrocity started w/ dehumanizing words ideas. Today we see a resurgence of this type of hatred. Only education, remembrance will counter these forces. #WeRemember
Today 800,000 families didn’t get a second paycheck due to the #TrumpShutdown. Now he's causing countless Americans to miss flights home, see loved ones, and conduct vital business. How many lives will Trump harm for his border boondoggle? It’s beyond time to #EndTheShutdown.
RT @AppropsDems: The #TrumpShutdown has claimed more victims: some of our nation’s busiest airports. After 35 days, @POTUS Republicans mu…
A #SebringShooting can get lost amid Trump's White House mayhem. This too-common violence must be addressed, to honor the tragic victims and to stem America's gun death epidemic. So much we can do. A good start: #HR8
A furloughed worker in my community lived paycheck-to-paycheck. Home fixes sapped her savings. She already missed a mortgage payment and faces a 2nd lost paycheck. The cruel #TrumpShutdown hurts too many innocent families. #EndTheShutdown
RT @MSNBC: House Oversight Cmte., now led by Democrats, is launching an investigation into White House security clearance process; plans to…
The #TrumpShutdown has dragged on more than a month. @realDonaldTrump must stop holding American families our economy hostage to his wasteful, ineffective wall. #EndTheShutdown
POTUS' advisers know: the #TrumpShutdown inflicts real economic pain on people.
I’m NOT the only one who &lt;3s Roe. Surveys regularly show a majority of voters want to protect a woman’s right to an abortion. And I will proudly stand with that majority to #FightForRoe. #Roe46
No one furthered racial and economic justice in America’s quest for true democracy more than Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His courage to fight bigotry, poverty war energize today's fight for voting and civil rights, battles that still carry the stain of racial injustice. #MLKDay
For years, @GOP lawmakers have been complicit in the largest voting rights rollbacks since the years of Jim Crow.RT if you agree: They must reverse course and join @HouseDemocrats in passing #HR1 to fight voter suppression and expand access to the ballot.
We took our energy, anger and experience, and organized and worked to redefine what leadership looks like in Washington. I'm proud to be one the women who make up this historic Congress.
Just some of the ways the #TrumpShutdown puts Americans in danger:Airport securityFood safetyBorder securityAir traffic safetyIt's time for Trump to end his border wall tantrum
More than ever, let's find common ground. Today, bipartisan women Members of Congress met with @usairforce Sec Wilson to discuss defense, foreign affairs, veterans intelligence issues. Proud to work w/ them for a brighter, safer future.
