She was patient #1 for Taxol, now an effective cancer treatment. She faced her illness with humor and Texas grit. I’m incredibly proud to be her son.
I recently had the honor of commemorating her by creating the Susan Crenshaw Congressional Healthcare Innovation Award that recognizes cutting-edge efforts in the healthcare space.
On #internationalwomensday I want to recognize the strongest woman I ever knew: my mother. She lost a 5-year fight against cancer when I was 10 years old. She was selfless, brave, and refused to give up on her family.

Today I offered a motion to recommit #HR1 reaffirming that only US citizens should have the right to vote. Dems rejected it. Next time you go to the ballot box, keep that in mind. The future of their party is in cities like San Fran, where illegals can vote. Let that sink in.
Um...Dems, we already passed a resolution that supposedly condemned Omar’s anti-Semitic remarks, remember?While I voted for this, let's be honest about what it really is - a deceitful way for Dems to give Omar cover. Her beliefs won't change. Her committee assignments should.
Watch the full clip here:
Dems want to talk about the humanity of our immigration policies. We do too. Stories like this one are horrific demonstrate how our flawed asylum process incentives human trafficking. By securing the border, we prioritize the humanity of these victims and our citizens.

Joining Fox News in a few minutes. Tune in!

Highly recommend tuning in to the Homeland Security Cmte hearing today with @SecNielsen so you can watch Dems do mental gymnastics trying to convince us there is no emergency on the border.On the heels of the news we had 76,000 illegal crossings last month. The most since 2007.
Why does the left hate the tax cuts? Bc they think the people exist to fund the govt. We believe the govt exists to protect the inalienable rights of the people.When people keep their money, we get more jobs wage growth, less wasteful spending by “benevolent” bureaucrats.
Great to meet with @govabbott today to discuss flood mitigation border security! Looking forward to working with his office to ensure we fully recover from Harvey. And as he said on border security: it’s no longer good enough to fight the fight, we must WIN the fight.
There are still members of Congress - all Dems - reflexively clinging to support of the tyrannical Maduro regime. This is wrong on a foreign policy level a moral one.Venezuelans are suffering need unified support. We should all get behind POTUS support Juan Guaidó.
The Senate is voting soon on the fundamental question of whether or not the situation at the southern border constitutes an emergency. It does. Watch this segment from Showtime’s “The Circus” with me and @mmckinnon.

Pre-summit punditry criticized POTUS as likely to give up too much. Post-summit punditry said he failed bc he walked away.Let’s clear this up: Negotiations take time. We are taking incremental steps to denuclearize North Korea. This is a goal that should unite all Americans.
This @michaeljknowles lookalike came to visit my office today. @benshapiro you could fire the real Knowles and hire this guy and no one would know....
More evidence our pro-growth policies work for Americans, yet there’s still a widespread belief that tax cuts and deregulation have no benefits.The truth needs to be told: you can’t fix inequality, poverty, or low wages without strong economic
Dems just voted down a very reasonable amendment to #HR8, which would have excluded TSA Pre Check members from the Universal Background Check requirement. They voted against it because they have no interest in honest conversations about gun control.
The truth about universal background checks and today’s vote.
My statement on tonight’s vote to terminate the national emergency declaration:
They also fail to mention the TCJA legislation resulted in an average tax cut in Texas of $1,300 and another 18,100 jobs added just in 2018. We still have record breaking govt revenue, even after tax cuts. We have a spending problem, not a revenue problem.
Sad reality: Senate Democrats voted against legislation that would provide medical care to infants who survive abortions. This is wrong.Unfortunately, our culture has become accustomed to devaluing life. Let’s be #prolife
Check out my op-ed with @RepGallagher about the serious implications of an isolationist foreign policy approach. We encourage the President to stay the course in Syria and Afghanistan.  We fight them there, so that they don’t bring the fight here. 
Also notable: - 80% of Americans believe abortion should be illegal after 1st trimester.- Nearly half of Americans identify as pro-life, a 17 point increase from last month.
Something to shake up your Twitter feed: young democrats are leading the shift in attitudes against abortion. I think we can all agree that infanticide is abhorrent and proposals like those in NY and VA have no place in our
This is literally a hostage situation. Venezuelans are locked in a socialist nightmare. Some politicians continue to support this awful dictator. That must stop.I support POTUS getting Venezuelans the help they desperately need - we all should.
At our 1st annual Congressional Healthcare Innovation Summit, we brought together Houston’s healthcare innovators to present their accomplishments connect with like-minded professionals. In Houston we are unleashing the power of life-saving innovation to create a better world.
Great example of Harris County taking the initiative to explore all options for flood mitigation. We must act swiftly. We need solutions that will last for generations to come. I’m proud to represent the 2nd District as we work towards those solutions.
I’m with @AIPAC. A group that advocates for a strong relationship between the US and Israel is a fundamentally pro-American organization. Proud to stand with them as they fight the lies and misinformation spread about them and Israel.
It’s one thing to protect the Mueller probe, it’s another to refuse to accept its findings launch politically motivated investigations to find a crime that suits you.Hard to believe that Americans would want a cmte to use its power to create chaos.

Great op-ed by @govlarryhogan about the border debate. This is bigger than any one party.“let’s move beyond the rhetoric and take a good, strong dose of the truth: We do need the $5.7 billion -- and likely much more -- to help us to secure our border.”
More evidence pro-growth policies work. Keep more of your money because you know best what to do with it, and let entrepreneurs innovate. •69% expect their financial situation to improve•Optimism is near record-high •50% say they're better
$1.37 billion for physical barriers is a good start, but our border agents need as much help as they can get, especially in the Rio Grande Valley area, where 40% of all apprehensions occur.  Don’t believe me? Check out what I learned from my trip there:
Today I spoke with Beth Van Duyne, Regional Administrator of HUD for TX. I voiced our concerns the dire need for HUD to approve mitigation funding. Great conversation. She assured me that HUD was determined to get us what we need in order to better prepare for the next storm.
It is dishonest and wrong to act as if there isn’t a problem at our border.
This plan was derived from DHS experts - from Border Patrol’s analysis of the weakest points - resulting in the $5.7B request. Dems have zero analysis. Just politics. They need to explain, with evidence and logic, why we should allocate less resources.
Last week we traveled to the border to get the facts from our Border Patrol agents. Watch what we learned right here, and see for yourself what the truth
GOP has asked for a vote on a bill that protects infants born alive after an attempted abortion. Shouldn't this already be in law, you might ask? Not according to Democrats, who won't even bring it to a vote. The left's position on abortion has reached new levels of extremism.
While I was at the border last week, 1,000 migrants were apprehended in one night. Border agents are facing a migrant caravan every night. Let’s give them the resources they’ve requested to do the crucial job we ask them to do.
Proud to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get this done.  Valor knows no rank. Providing full military honors is the least we can do for our Prisoners Of War and Medal Of Honor recipients. 
Thanks for having me, @Morning_Joe!
Last night, I ran into @repbuddycarter and his #SOTU guest Lt. Col. Ken Dwyer, who lost his left eye. Together we have a full visual field! #Neverforget
Our first #SOTU.
My thoughts on tonight's #SOTU:
Last week on the House floor, I called on Congress to stop the political games and take action on border security. I laid out the real story behind this debate, the wall, and the Department of Homeland Security’s comprehensive border plan.
Looking forward to tonight’s #SOTU. @POTUS will lay out his vision for the country highlight the progress we’ve made. While we’ve accomplished a lot, we still have work to do, especially when it comes to securing our border. Be sure to tune in at 9pm ET/ 8pm CT tonight!
Great turnout at our meet and greet this weekend. Thanks to those who attended!
This is the very reason I wanted to be on the Budget Committee. Mandatory spending accounts for 70% of our federal spending. We desperately need commonsense reforms to ensure programs, such as social security, are there for the next generation.
One of the best parts about my job: this week I got to tell a young Texan that he was accepted to West Point. I’m grateful for the next generation’s willingness to serve. This commitment will shape the rest of his life. Can’t wait to see what this young man accomplishes!
Biggest takeaway from my trip to the border: walls work.There's a reason our border patrol agents request physical barriers - they help them accomplish the very difficult mission we ask them to do.
Reminder to TX-02 residents: join me tomorrow at Little Woodrow's Midtown from 4:30-6:00 pm CT. We’ll discuss what I’ve been doing in Congress to serve you the truth about border security. RSVP here:
When you deregulate and reduce taxes on an innovative, entrepreneurial population like we have in the US, we thrive. We create jobs. Wages rise. America is the place that everyone wants to be. And yet, we still debate the merits of these pro-growth policies.
If you’ve been following updates, you know I’m in the Rio Grande Valley to get the real story on the border from Customs and Border Protection. Tonight I’ll be joining @SeanHannity on @FoxNews to discuss what we’ve learned. Tune in at 8:25pm CT!
In Rio Grande Valley sector today at the southern border. Brownsville area has 35 miles of fencing and accounts for 6% of illegal apprehensions. McAllen, 45 minutes to the west, has sparse fencing and accounts for 94% of illegal apprehensions. But walls don’t work, right?
TX-02 residents: join me on Saturday at Little Woodrow’s Midtown to discuss what I’ve been doing in Congress to serve you the truth about border security. Hope to see you there!
As Venezuelans again take to the streets to fight for freedom, socialist dictator Maduro claims he is open to negotiations. History tells us this is a facade.  To the people of Venezuela – continue raising your voices, we hear you support you.

@amy_kaymay Hey Jury! ��
Proud to cosponsor this legislation. Federal employees should never have to carry the burden caused by a dysfunctional government. The President, Vice President and Congress should have to feel the same pain and uncertainty that our federal employees face during a shutdown.
Praying for a swift recovery for these courageous officers. They put their lives in danger to keep us safe. It’s an honorable and admirable job. We are eternally grateful for their service.
Looking forward to it. Tune in at 2:30pm ET!
Yesterday I had the pleasure of joining the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston to celebrate their 20th Anniversary. Thanks @IACCGHouston for 2 decades of empowering the Indian business community through education encouraging bilateral trading opportunities.
This morning I joined @fox26houston to discuss the President temporarily reopening the government and our border security plan. The government is now open. No more excuses from Democrats. Let’s hear why they won’t support holistic border security, I’m all ears.
On Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the millions of lives lost at the hands of hatred, including six million Jewish victims.  We commemorate the WWII veterans from around the globe who risked their lives to end the evils of a hateful ideology. #WeRemember
Good news not just for Texas, a global energy leader, but for the whole country. Energy independence means cleaner and cheaper energy for all of us.
Congress must reach a reasonable, realistic solution to fund our government and protect our border. Governing from shutdown to shutdown cannot be a new norm. Our federal employees should not carry the burden of government dysfunction.Let’s get this done for the American people.
The President demonstrated yet again he is willing to make a deal. I’m hopeful this will spur serious and thoughtful negotiations. Securing our border is a bipartisan issue. Improving our border security through a multifaceted approach is a win for everyone.
The United States stands with #Venezuela and Juan Guaidó. I’m proud to back our President on this one. I’ve witnessed this beautiful country deteriorate, and it’s time to end the suffering. Watch my statement below:
Honored to be appointed to @househomeland and @housebudgetgop. This is where I need to be: improving our national security and disaster preparedness, and looking out for the next generation by fighting for responsible and sustainable spending.
Joining @foxnews momentarily to discuss the shutdown, border security and everything House GOP is doing to reopen the government and pay our federal employees. Tune in!
Update: House GOP voted again to pay federal employees. This time just ten Democrats joined us: speak louder than words.
Great meeting with students from Kingwood High School and Incarnate Word Academy! We talked about what it’s like to work in Congress. My door is always open to our future leaders. Thanks for stopping by.
Great piece on the efficiency of physical barriers at a border. We’ve seen it work time after time in Yuma, San Diego, Tucson and as detailed here in Laredo, TX. A wall is a critical part of securing our border.
Big deal that never got reported:Last week, House GOP voted to pay federal employees their 1st paycheck of 2019, despite shutdown. Only 6 Dems voted with us. It failed.Dem priority is not paying workers or opening gov't. It is opposing Trump.
I’m proud to stand with the Administration as we recognize the only democratically elected body in Venezuela.
Today we celebrate the incredible life legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He dedicated his life to standing up for what is just, despite great adversity. Our society is better because of his selfless work. May his words and example live on forever. #MLKDay
The President’s proposal demonstrates his commitment to reopening our govt and addressing the crisis at the border. Pelosi rejected this compromise outright. Dem colleagues: come to the table and negotiate in good faith. It is our duty to secure our border and reopen the govt.
This is a great write-up of the Patriots we lost this week in Syria. #NeverForget
It's time for the United States to strongly consider recognizing Juan Guaidó as acting President of Venezuela. Maduro's reign of terror has gone on too long. Venezuelans are suffering, and the region is destabilizing. @StateDept
I commend my colleagues for wanting to honor our troops. But on day 27 of the shutdown no end in sight, our first priority should be negotiating a deal. Not trips to Puerto Rico or congressional delegation trips abroad. Time to do our job: secure the border, reopen the govt
Joined @DanaPerino to discuss today’s suicide attack in Syria. My heart goes out to the families of the service members who lost their lives. We need to keep up the fight against ISIS so that these soldiers' lives were not lost in vain. Never Forget.
Today we celebrate #ReligiousFreedomDay. All religions have a place in America.No more harassing religious bakers.No more unconstitutional questioning (see Article VI) of judicial nominees' faith.No more forcing employers and doctors to act against their conscience.
I joined @GovAbbott, @SenTedCruz, @JohnCornyn and fellow Texans in the House in asking President Trump to protect Harvey relief funding. We must secure our border, but it cannot be at the expense of relief funds.
Proud to vote in favor of H. Res. 41, which denounced white nationalism and white supremacy. Rep. Steve King’s comments have no place in this country. White supremacy cannot be tolerated in any form.
Democrats literally will not come to the table to end this shutdown. They must explain to the American people why their grandstanding is more important than our security and a fully functional government.   
Expert-led, holistic border security:-234 miles of physical barrier -$800M for medical/humanitarian -More law enforcement-Counter-drug tech at points of entry-More immigration judges-Better detention facilities Not a “medieval” wall. A real solution. Retweet the truth.
The implications of the partial government shutdown are real and painful. Enough is enough. We need to negotiate a deal and end this shutdown for the sake of the American people. We all win with better border security.
Last night @ShannonBream asked me about reports indicating the Administration is considering using disaster relief funding to pay for our border security needs. Here’s what I had to say about potentially using Hurricane Harvey relief funding:
Joined @Foxnewsnight yesterday to discuss border security. Our multifaceted approach includes a wall, but is so much more than that. It's a realistic, reasonable solution.
Today is #NationalHumanTraffickingAwarenessDay. It’s hard to imagine a worse fate for another human being. We should always be asking ourselves: what more can we do to prevent this? This is especially important in Houston, which experiences the pain of this on such a large scale.
Read my @WSJ op-ed laying out the arguments Democrats are using against a border wall and debunking each one here:
I don't usually recommend that people watch CSPAN, but Minority Whip @SteveScalise is absolutely worth watching right now. He makes a clear and coherent case for border security. Dems won't negotiate even one dollar, and they are holding federal workers hostage as a result.
Great meeting with President's Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, where he assured Texans that he understood the deep concerns about using Harvey relief funds for the border. Best solution is still reopening government with adequate funding for border.
I cannot in good conscience get paid while federal employees’ financial futures hang in the balance because of this partial government shutdown. I’ve asked the Chief Administrative Officer to withhold my pay until we have come to an agreement to adequately fund border security.
Grateful for all the hardworking law enforcement officers both in #TX02 and across America. Thank you for the sacrifices you make day in and day out to protect our families, friends and communities. #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay
Democrats are pretending that this budget is about a 2,000 mile contiguous wall. They know that isn't true. It's about a multi-faceted approach to border security, which includes 234 miles of physical barriers.Stop making arguments against an idea that doesn't exist.
RT @RepMeuser: "Let’s not continue to let the people down, let’s show that this Congress can do things better."MORE:
5) Dismissing a wall or fence as an “ineffective” or “4th century” solution is an attempt to undermine the plan without providing any logical reasoning. Don’t succumb to lazy arguments. Let’s think this through, and reopen the government with adequate funding for border security.
4) A wall in one location frees up manpower resources in another. This is important when understanding why we are okay with building in some areas and waiting on others.
3) Walls are necessary, but of course we recognize that they aren’t the only solution. Some places require different methods, as the President’s plan recognizes. Drones, sensors, more patrols, etc. It all works together, and physical barriers are a part of that.
2) The problem must be solved in a multi-faceted way. Physical barriers are a necessary part of that solution. Just ask the migrant caravan when they arrived in Tijuana, where the wall prevented them from overrunning our border agents. Walls mitigate movement. Period.
Tonight, the President will be speaking on border security. Some things to keep in mind:1) The problems on the border need to be addressed. 400,000 illegal aliens being apprehended per year while crossing an open border is completely unsustainable.
Thank you Harris County Sheriff Office, I’m grateful for your dedicated work. This senseless tragedy took such an innocent, young life from us far too soon. As we pray for Jazmine's family, I hope this brings them some sense of justice.
Great December jobs report. No denying that recent policies are working. This is what we said would happen with tax reform and deregulation – and it did.-      312K jobs added-      3.2% wage growth since 2017-      more Americans entering workforce
3) The belief that because you can't put a wall everywhere (i.e. the Rio Grande), that you should, therefore, put a wall nowhere.
Definition of Border Denialism:1) The belief that physical barriers can simply be “climbed over”…just like that. 2) The belief that there’s “no real problem” on the border because 400,000 illegals apprehended on border per year is “insignificant.”
What a week. Honored and privileged to officially represent the great people of TX-02. I’m so thankful for your continued support. Now the real work begins.
