It’s unacceptable for Members of Congress to continue receiving their salaries while federal workers across the country are furloughed and the govt services they provide the American people are interrupted. Especially during the holidays. It’s just not right.

If Congress can’t keep the government fully operational, we shouldn’t get paid. It’s that simple.
