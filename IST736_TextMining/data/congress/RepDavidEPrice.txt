Not only is there no national emergency at the border: crossings remain at historically low levels. My full statement:

In the year since Parkland, 26 states enacted gun safety legislation. Unfortunately, the NC legislature failed to act. I will continue to push for vital gun safety measures at the federal level to prevent gun violence.

With only 10 days before the government runs out of funding once again, we heard nothing from the President on how to avoid another #TrumpShutdown. Democrats are ready to fund smart, effective solutions for border security. The President is only ready to play games.

Rep. Steve King's recent comments are the latest in a career filled with racist and offensive rhetoric that has no place in the U.S. Congress. I'm pleased the House voted on a bipartisan basis to condemn his remarks and I join my colleagues who have called for his resignation.
Today would have been Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 90th birthday. Let us always remember his unrelenting commitment to righting injustice and recommit ourselves to his unfinished work.
While the government shutdown is certainly Donald Trump's fault, 800,000 federal employees remain unpaid because of @senatemajldr's spineless refusal to put funding bills on the floor that would assuredly pass in the Senate.
As I wrote in the @theobserver, the Trump admin hoped to make the Census the latest front in GOP efforts to suppress voters disenfranchise people of color. This is a major victory in preventing these efforts ensuring a free and fair process plays out.

10. We don't need the President's lies broadcast to national TV to tell us what we already know: the Trump administration's immigration agenda was built on xenophobia and bad faith.
9. The Trump administration's own internal documents show even his most heartless policy--family separation--failed to achieve a deterrent effect.
8. To make matters worse, as Trump slams the door on asylum seekers, he has proposed to gut aid to the very countries from which migrants are seeking refuge, further exacerbating the crisis.
7: The Trump administration has claimed 4,000 known or suspected terrorists have been prevented from entering U.S....FACT: @CBP encountered only SIX at ports of entry along US-Mexico border--that's 35 less than total apprehensions on the US-CANADA border.
6: Also, states with higher populations of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller undocumented populations.
5: The Trump administration's entire immigration platform is predicated on the idea that immigrants commit crimes. FACT: undocumented immigrants are far less likely to commit crime than native-born citizens.
4: The number of illegal border crossings is less than half of the number of individuals traveling by plane or boat who overstayed their visa in 2017. Additionally, the number of visa overstays declined from 2016 to 2017.
3: In fact, since the end of the Great Recession, more Mexican immigrants have returned to Mexico from the U.S. than have migrated here. The total number of undocumented immigrants from Mexico has declined by more than 1 million since 2007.
2: While the number of illegal border crossings ticked up slightly in 2018, overall they have declined by MORE THAN 75% since peaking in the year 2000.

In the six years since the massacre at #SandyHook, Congress has not passed one significant piece of legislation that would have prevented the attack. As a Vice-Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, I know this new congress will be different.
