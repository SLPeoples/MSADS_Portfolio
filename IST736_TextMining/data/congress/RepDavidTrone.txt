On #InternationalWomensDay we honor women and their strength, determination, and perseverance. Today, I’m celebrating my mother, my wife, my daughters, the brilliant Congresswomen of the 116th Congress, and the many women around the world who lift up their communities.
Grateful to law enforcement for keeping our communities safe. We can't stop working until we #EndtheAddictionCrisis
Congratulations to Potomac's own Herbert Hoover Middle School for their excellent performance in the 2019 National Science Bowl! Maryland will be rooting for you at the National Finals!

It was great running into @ACLU_MD today while I was in Annapolis. I've been a long-time supporter of the work of the ACLU and all they do to fight for fair and just policies across both Maryland and our country.
To invest in our future, we must take care of our environment. That's why I'm joining the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Taskforce - to ensure we do everything we can to preserve the Bay. Thanks to @MDLCV for talking to me today about some of the great work you're doing in this area.
It's up to Congress to provide checks and balances on the executive branch. I'm glad my Senate colleagues are on board to block President Trump's
We have so much work to do. I could not be more thankful to @repjohnlewis  and @FaithNPolitics for being our host this weekend and shining a light on the truths of our past and the work we must do to fight for a more just future.  #GoodTrouble #FPICivilRights 6/
Humanity has the ability to inflict such cruelty on each other. This powerful memorial shows the symbolic hanging of those we lost. In 2018 the Senate unanimously approved a bill to make lynching a federal crime. It’s only a shame that it took this long. 5/
One stop that sticks with me is the Visit to the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which commemorates the millions that were targeted by racial terror lynchings. The brutality and terror that occurred in this country is sobering. 4/
We have become the world's largest jailer - 25 percent of world's incarcerated people are incarcerated in the United States.Now is the time for Congress to step up for REAL criminal justice reform. We have so far to go to address these glaring inequalities. 3/

Powerful words and beautiful voices filled Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church this afternoon, the starting point for the Selma to Montgomery Marches and the meeting place of the SCLC during the Selma movement. Another amazing stop on the @FaithNPolitics #FPICivilRights Pilgrimage.
Marching across the Edmund Pettus Bridge linking arms with @repjohnlewis and so many others today made clear: we are all in this together and we must all continue the fight to protect what President Johnson so rightly called the ‘dignity of man and the destiny of democracy.’
“They came toward us. Beating us with knife sticks and bull whips. Tramping us with horses, and releasing the tear gas. 17 of us were hurt.”It’s so humbling to be in the presence of American hero @repjohnlewis as he recounts what we now know as Bloody Sunday. #FPICivilRights
At the 16th Street Baptist Church with @repjohnlewis in Alabama and remembering the four young girls that were killed at a racially motivated bombing during the #CivilRightsMovement. We must never forget how far we have come, and how much work we still have to do. #GoodTrouble
I’m looking forward to working with @RepLucyMcBath to do more when it comes to preventing gun violence. That’s why I’m excited to announce that we will hold our first ever gun violence prevention event with @RepLucyMcBath this year in the 6th District.There’s no time to waste.
When I looked up to the House Gallery, I saw @MomsDemand. I was able to vote for this measure - but it's the work from regular people and grassroots organizations who have tirelessly advocated for gun violence prevention that got us here today.
25 years.That's how long it's been since the House has passed a major bill on gun violence prevention.Today we changed that. I was proud to support H.R. 8, a measure that requires universal background checks for all gun sales. #EndGunViolenceNow

To create a greener future, we have to start from the ground up. The creation of the Appalachian Forest National Heritage Area, part of the package to protect our #PublicLands passed yesterday, will help preserve and restore Maryland's forests. This is a big win #ForThePeople.
Grateful that @RepCummings is leading @OversightDems today. The American people deserve to hear Michael Cohen's testimony and make their own judgement.
Democrats and Republicans just voted to block President Trump's #FakeEmergency to build a southern border wall. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this legislation.Now it's up the Senate. We must all stand together against this unlawful act.
Fair pay is good for business and simply the right thing to do. Happy to support #PaycheckFairness today!
Trump’s #FakeEmergency makes America less safe by stealing billions from crucial military construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness quality of life necessary to do their jobs effectively. We must stand up against this unlawful action.

This day feels surreal for me. In 2016, I lost my nephew Ian to a fentanyl overdose at the age of 24 after five years of working with him to get treatment from some of the best programs and therapists possible.No family deserves to suffer the loss of a loved one to addiction.
The numbers are devastating:- 192 people die every day from drug overdoses- Last year over 70,000 people died from drug overdoses- Americans are now more likely to die from an opioid overdose than a car crashThis cannot continue. We must come together to end this crisis.
This bipartisan group of freshmen will bring fresh eyes to one of the most devastating crises facing our country. We will:- Learn from experts and stakeholders- Visit institutions focusing on research and treatment- Promote legislation to tackle the epidemic
It’s time to take action.That’s why today I'm announcing the formation of the Freshmen Working Group on Addiction. 36 Democrats and Republicans from the freshman class have come together in this group to focus on promoting policies to #EndtheAddictionCrisis
One of the students who lost his life that day was Joaquin "Guac" Oliver. This 3D statue shows him with a flower in his hand, a tribute to the Valentine's Day gift he had for his girlfriend. Today especially we remember the toll of gun violence, and the innocent lives it takes.
17 people were killed one year ago today in the #ParklandSchoolShooting. May we never forget those who lost their lives and their families who continue to  fight for commonsense gun reform in their memory. #MSDstrong #NeverAgain

To be clear, AIPAC is a bipartisan organization that supports the US-Israel relationship, and Israel is a progressive, democratic beacon of light in the Middle East. Comparing AIPAC to the NRA shows a serious lack of listening and learning.
The U.S. and Israel have a strong bond because of our shared democratic interests and values, and the use of prejudicial tropes is both deeply hurtful and ill-informed. I agree with @SpeakerPelosi that Rep. Omar should apologize.
It makes me sick to my stomach that active-shooter trainings are now a fact of life for our kids.

Literally thousands of Brookes all over America are being claimed by this epidemic. My nephew Ian was one of them. He died at the age of 24 from a fentanyl overdose.This is not a tragedy of just Hagerstown or Maryland, it’s the most important tragedy that America faces.

On this #HolocaustRemembrenceDay, we remember the 6 million Jews that were killed during the Holocaust. Anti-Semitism still exists, and today is another reminder of the importance of standing with and supporting the Jewish people.

33 days. That’s how long 800,000 workers have been watching @realDonaldTrump hold their paychecks hostage as he tries to force U.S. taxpayers — not Mexico — to pay for his ineffective wall. This isn’t a game, Mr. President. You must re-open government now!  #EndTheShutdown

An estimated 23,119 federal workers in Maryland are either furloughed or working without pay. It’s time to end the #TrumpShutdown and fund the federal government. @AppropsDems
We need to end the #TrumpShutdown and let federal employees go back to work. $5 billion for a wall is a waste of money and goes against our values as a country.
 Provide 1.4 million teachers with school supplies they usually pay for out of their own pockets Increase before and after school opportunities for 250,000 children
 Increase primary health care services for thousands Provide 27,262 units of affordable housing and create 11,401 jobs  Meet and maintain standards for drinking water and waste infrastructure
With $5 billion, we could make a lot of change in Maryland’s 6th District and our country: We could do ALL of the below: Create 2,078 units of housing for the disabled Repave 1,679 miles of 2 lane highway Increase access to Head Start for 36,000 low-income children
Many of these employees live in the district I represent, #MD06. They cannot pay their mortgages, utilities, or car payments. These are real people being affected by a reckless decision from the President to build an unnecessary $5 billion border wall.
Recognizing the detrimental impact of the #TrumpShutdown on federal employees and families, I’ve decided to make one of my first acts as a representative to cosponsor @RepDonBeyer’s bill on retroactive pay for federal employees affected by the closing of the federal government.
