#InternationalWomensDay extended to the weekend in @CA_Richmond as the city joined with Sisters in Solidarity to celebrate women who have made an impact both here in #CA11 and throughout the country. #BalanceForBetter
The re-opening of the Center for Elders’ Independence facility in El Sobrante provides another resource for seniors in #CA11 who want to continue to live independently.

For almost 15 years, the overtime salary threshold has been stuck at $23,660. The Obama Administration had a responsible plan to increase it that respected workers. #Trump's plan stops far short of what is needed, and is a slap in the face to the workers he claims to represent.
Thanks to California members of @AIACALIF for stopping by my DC office to discuss ways we can design schools for safety, and how to increase energy efficiency. Together we can improve the learning environments for our nation’s students, save energy, and fight climate change.

Over 2.5 hours into the @OversightDems #MichaelCohen hearing and Republicans had not asked Mr. Cohen a single question about Donald Trump.
“I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on Hillary w/ the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad’s desk that day Mr. Trump knew that was the meeting Don Jr. was talking about when he said “That’s good let me know”

More than half of African American workers are paid less than $15, and women workers account for almost 55% of low wage workers. We need to #RaiseTheWage as a matter of fairness and equality.
Hardworking men and women deserve to be able to afford their basic needs and take care of their families. Let’s honor our workers and #RaiseTheWage today! #FightFor15
As a former small business owner, I have seen the benefits of investing in our workers. To those who say the minimum wage is too high, we say no—the problem with the minimum wage is that it is too LOW. #RaiseTheWage #FightFor15
The federal minimum wage is not a living wage, and it is contributing to our terrible inequality. There is nowhere in America that a full-time worker earning $7.25 an hour can afford the basics. #FightFor15 #RaiseTheWage
Thank you to the hardworking men and women who traveled from all over the country to show support for our efforts to #RaiseTheWage. The @EdLaborCmte is fighting for you and for an economy that works for all.
America’s infrastructure was once the envy of the world, but today it is losing its battle against time, growth, and #climatechange. We need to take bold, new innovative approaches to tackling these issues head-on. #TheCostOfInaction
We have the largest, busiest most complex aviation system in the world. Annually it supports more than a billion passengers $1 trillion in economic activity. #TheCostOfInaction opens us up to new safety risks. As a member of @transportdems I'm working to make it safer.

For more than 200 years, America has been a beacon of hope to those fleeing unthinkable violence and a better life. We can never forget what makes our country great.  #SOTU
He was held in ICE detention for six months in our district, and his case is still in process. Akelo is an example of the negative impacts the Trump Administration’s immigration policies have on people who come to our country legally to seek asylum.
Akelo currently works as a service coordinator at a mental health facility in California. In 2016, after his mother and uncle were brutally murdered, Akelo arrived in the U.S. legally via San Francisco, where he sought asylum.
Proud to host Akelo Zuluka, an asylum seeker from Africa, as my guest at tonight's #SOTU.
According to his aides, @realDonaldTrump will deliver a “bipartisan” message during #SOTU and focus on “unity.” His tweets tell a different story.

Each year, thousands of students attend school in crumbling or unsafe buildings. Instead of building a border wall, Republicans should support rebuilding America’s schools. #BuildSchoolsNotWalls
RT @rosadelauro: Women and men doing the same job deserve the same pay—period. That’s why Congress needs to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act.…
