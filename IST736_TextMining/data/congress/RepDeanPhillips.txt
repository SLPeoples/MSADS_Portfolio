Liberian Minnesotans have been our taxpaying neighbors, coworkers, caretakers and friends for decades. And they will be for decades to come. Join us in this fight. �
Thank you to Tiffany, David, Steve and all of you who came out to join the conversation about #HR1. I’m always impressed by the people of #MN03 - what a smart, engaged and energized community we have. Lots of work to do #ForThePeople!
We’re live in Minnesota at a Community Conversation on #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.
@rayrlewis1 2pm, Ray!
Here's this week's #FridayFollowUp! It was a big week in Congress highlighted by the passage of #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. Watch below to hear more ️️️
It’s #InternationalWomensDay⁠, the MN House just passed an ERA bill, and one of the most remarkable women in the world, my mother DeeDee, spoke at today’s rally at the Capitol. A shout-out to all who have fought for equality for generations, and to those leading the way today.
It was my honor and privilege to help pass #HR1 in the House. Now we continue the hard work of rebuilding our democracy, protecting our elections and eliminating the corrupting influence of big money in politics. I urge the Senate to join us in this #powergrab #forthepeople.
RT @CommonCause: BREAKING: The U.S. House of Representatives just passed the boldest democracy reform bill since the Watergate era. The #Fo…
We did it - we passed #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act!But this is just the beginning of the fight for reform. Now we have to make sure Mitch McConnell and the Senate vote for this historic legislation. Get on it, @senatemajldr!
Update: Headed to the Floor to pass #HR1 which now includes 3 of my amendments! They’re focused on strengthening the enforcement powers, bipartisanship and diversity of the FEC, our nation’s election watchdog, and closing lobbying loopholes for the executive branch.#ForThePeople
#HR1 is a #PowerGrab #ForThePeople. We’re closing lobbyist loopholes, prohibiting members of Congress and the executive branch from serving on corporate boards and strengthening ethics oversight. Every page is written to return power to you. ��
It's a great day for democracy! We're about to vote for #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.I took a moment to celebrate with my friend @RepAndyKimNJ on the steps of the Capitol this morning.
RT @RepSarbanes: We’re about to make history! Tune
Looking forward to being there - it's a great day for democracy!
Happy to report that the #ForThePeople Act is progressing on the House Floor.I'm heading there shortly to testify on an amendment I authored to make sure the FEC has the tools it needs to operate independently and hold administrations accountable - #HR1 keeps getting better!
Whatever your number 1 issue, I ask that you make campaign finance reform your number 2.(The culture of corruption caused by the relentless pursuit of money in politics is what stands in the way of us getting to work on your number 1.)It’s time to fix this. #ForThePeople #HR1
Spread the word:We’re rescheduled for March nine,See you there to listen, learn and opine! Join me for an #HR1 Community Conversation this weekend:
Voters should choose their politicians. Politicians shouldn’t choose their voters. #HR1 makes Election Day a holiday, enacts automatic voter registration, expands early voting and vote by mail, ends partisan gerrymandering and increases election security. #ForThePeople ���
We're LIVE! Join us and tweet your questions using #TownHallForThePeopleLink here
Join us at 6 PM Central at the @NowThisPolitics Facebook page for our #TownHallForThePeople! We'll be taking your questions about #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.Excited to discuss how we're going to reduce the influence of special interests and restore power to you.
I spoke on the House Floor today to voice my full support for #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.People are losing faith in the integrity and fairness of our political system. Let’s pass #HR1 and begin the principled work of restoring our democracy for the people.
Thanks to everyone for your interest in tonight's #TownHallForThePeople.It will be broadcast at 6 PM CST in a live stream on @NowThisPolitics' Facebook page: looking forward to answering your questions with my colleagues!
Representation begins with listening, and our local leaders are amazing, knowledgeable advocates for our community. Looking forward to doing great things for Minnesotans with this group! #MN03
The 2018 midterms were the most expensive in history - we can’t allow that trend to continue. #HR1 begins the work of ending the corrupting influence of money in politics. Disclosure, oversight and overturning Citizens United are on the table, we must get this done. #ForThePeople
Looking forward to taking part in a #TownHallForThePeople tonight with @RepSarbanes and several of my fellow freshmen. Have questions about what #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act means for America?Tweet us your questions using #TownHallForThePeople!
I'm here in the Capitol, about to head into the Rules Committee to offer some amendments to #HR1.We'll be posting updates as we work to pass the #ForThePeople Act all week long!
Excited to vote for #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act this week!It's my top priority to restore your faith in an honest and transparent government, and this bill is the first step in doing that.I'll be keeping you updated all week as we work to get this done - stay tuned!
You’re right, @senatemajldr, #HR1 is designed to benefit just one side; THE VOTERS. #ForThePeople
We will vote on #HR1 this week to end the corrupting influence of big money in politics, make it easier to vote and put government back to work #ForThePeople. I’m grateful for the energy and passion of those in #MN03 and beyond who have worked so hard for this historic change.
#FridayFollowUp (on Monday), episode 7: It was a historic week in Congress as we passed two, common-sense gun violence prevention measures, #HR8 and #HR1112. This week we'll consider #HR1, the most important reform bill of our generation. Stay tuned... #ForThePeople
@BlueInMinn @BurnsieMN @Ilhan That’s correct. The top image is from a display in the WV Capitol and bottom image is from a gas station in Rogers.
A core promise of America is the vigilant protection of free speech and the security of those who engage in it. While I strongly object to some of Rep. @ilhan Omar’s recent comments, the disgusting display in the WV Capitol and threats on her life are antithetical to our values.
Thoughts and tweets don’t save lives, ACTION saves lives. Today the 116th Congress took action and passed #HR8 to ensure sensible and reasonable background checks on firearms purchases. Here’s to all who have dedicated themselves to affecting change, particularly @MomsDemand. ️
The President’s declaration of a nat’l emergency diversion of funds already appropriated by Congress for other uses, represents executive overreach sets a dangerous precedent. That’s why I’m co-sponsoring @JoaquinCastrotx’s resolution of termination.
Please help me protect 4,000 members of our amazing Liberian community who’ve been working, contributing and building lives in MN for many years. We need @POTUS to extend DED before 3/31 and Congress must pass the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act!
Friday Follow-Up, episode 6: Listening and learning back in #MN03! Our new office in Minnetonka, meeting school superintendents Hennepin County Commissioners, and advocating for our Liberian community. Please keep sharing your comments, and have a great weekend! #FridayFollowUp

Imagine if each of us invested just a little more of ourselves in community. “Culture changes when a small group of people, often on the margins of society, find a better way to live, and other people begin to copy them.”-@nytdavidbrooks
Please read this, r/t this, and begin talking about this. Our allies are making an appeal. The consequences are real and the risks significant. It’s time for Democrats and Republicans to collectively recognize that our duty is to country, not a President.
Please join me and special guests @MNSteveSimon, @Tiffany_Muller @ProfDSchultz for a conversation about #HR1, the #ForThePeopleAct to �corruption, expand voting rights, �transparency, reform our broken campaign�system. Wednesday, February 20 • 6:30p • Hopkins High School
Friday Follow-Up, episode 5: The border security vote, my first floor speech,  #HR8 and background checks, protecting our Liberian DED community, my assignment to the Ethics Committee and more. Please keep sharing your comments and ideas, and have a great weekend! #FridayFollowUp
The victims, first responders and entire community of #Aurora are in my heart this evening. We must redouble our efforts to convert thoughts to actions so Americans can go to school and work without the fear of being shot.
Agreed @RepTjCox, it’s time to moo von. @RepSpanberger @RepCunningham

I just joined my Democratic and Republican colleagues in voting 300-128 for the compromise border security bill to ensure our government remains funded and open. Is it perfect? No. But now we move forward and start tackling the issues we were sent here to address. #ForThePeople
Today marks one year since the tragic day in Parkland, FL on which 17 lives were cut short by gun violence. Last night, after many arduous hours, the House Judiciary Committee voted for universal background checks. The transition from thoughts to action is underway. #MSDstrong
Honored to have joined House Democratic Caucus Chair @RepJeffries and Vice-Chair @RepKClark for our weekly press conference to discuss border security, and end to shutdowns, #HR1, and more.
I shared my feelings with Rep. Omar face-to-face this evening in an impassioned and frank exchange. One thing is for certain, if mutual respect and understanding is our goal - let’s invest more time talking and less time tweeting.

Friday Follow-Up, episode 4: State of The Union address, The Medicare Negotiation Competitive Licensing Act to reduce prescription drug prices, and only ~50 days until the expiration of DED. Please keep sharing your comments and ideas, and have a great weekend! #FridayFollowUp
Salient words of advice from an icon of the US House, Rep. John Dingell, who has passed away at age 92. From his role in passing the Civil Rights Act of 1957 to the Endangered Species Act, he left an indelible mark on America. @RepDebDingell and family are in our hearts tonight.
Proud to join @SenAmyKlobuchar, @SenSherrodBrown, @RepLloydDoggett,  @PeterWelch and others today as an original co-sponsor of The Medicare Negotiation Competitive Licensing Act. 90% of Americans agree it’s time for Medicare to reduce the burden on patients taxpayers.#action
Former Stanley Cup winner with the LA Kings and all-around great guy, @KWesty19 stopped by to give me some pointers for next year’s game (I forgot my equipment for tonight’s) and try on my dad’s 1960 St. Paul Central glove. #StateOfHockey #HockeyOnTheHill
.@jonlovett Lemme know if you need a lightly used, #SOTU experienced, white dinner jacket with an “ERA Now” pin applied by @AOC for tonight’s show.
I wore white to the #SOTU to honor the extraordinary women of the 116th Congress, to honor my mother Dee Dee, whose “ERA Now” pin I remember well, and the suffragettes, whose tireless work afforded my great-grandmothers, Sara Johnson and Rose Phillips, the right to vote in 1920.
I applaud @POTUS’s call for bipartisanship, reducing the cost of healthcare prescriptions, fighting childhood cancer, investing in infrastructure paid family leave. But we can’t forget about draining the swamp: ethics reform, voter protection, campaign finance reform. #HR1
Friday Follow-Up, episode 3: Maria Sanford, sub-committee assignments, and anti-shutdown, anti-dark money and Election Day holiday legislation. Representation begins with listening, so please share your comments, perspectives and ideas, and have a great weekend!
This wasn’t high school. This wasn’t college. This was during medical school in the 1980’s. The people of Virginia will dictate Gov. Northam’s future, but one thing is clear; elected officials should be held to the same standard no matter which political party they represent.
Are you appalled by our #27 ranking in voter turnout among developed democracies? I am. That’s why I’m co-sponsoring #HR1, the #ForThePeopleAct, to make Election Day a holiday, registration easier voting more accessible to millions of Americans. Isn’t that our job?@House_DRTF
Sen. McConnell opposes making Election Day a holiday because he believes federal employees already have enough days off. So let’s make a deal, and trade Columbus Day for Election Day. The day we vote is worthy of such reverence. Retweet if you agree.

I was proud to join my freshmen colleagues today to introduce #HR834, The Shutdown to End All Shutdowns (SEAS) Act, to eliminate this destructive political tactic once and for all. If you agree, please spread the word! #NoMoreShutdowns #SEASact
Seventy-fours years ago today,  the #Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated - ending one of the darkest chapters of human history. With fewer and fewer survivors still living, it is now up to us to share their stories and ensure it never happens again. #WeRemember⁠
It’s time for Friday Follow-Up II. The shutdown is over! Negotiations will begin immediately, and I hope to inspire bold and permanent solutions for border security and immigration reform - including DACA, TPS and DED, which I’ve implored be included in any deal.
The President just announced he’ll sign the 3-week, continuing resolution to RE-OPEN government for which I and fellow D and R members of the Problem Solvers Caucus advocated during our meeting with him last week. Now it’s up to members of both parties to negotiate in good faith.
Henry, our Norwich Terrier, helps me with canine constituent services and hopes to become a pawliamentarian someday � #dogs @dog_rates @HouseDemocrats
@KGinMN @2harvest Amazing!��
Legislation to re-open government that we‘ve already passed in the House will receive a vote in the Senate on Thursday. Sixty senators and one President can end this madness by week’s end, and we can get to work immediately on a border security and immigration reform package.
A strong and brave America should encourage those of physical and mental fortitude to serve in our armed forces - no matter how they look, pray or identify. Trans people now protecting our nation in uniform are far more honorable than those hoping to ban their service. #truth
An inspiring morning at ⁦@NorthHennepin⁩ w/Mayors Lunde and Harris talking transit and Trio, followed by fascinating visits to ⁦@getolympus⁩ and ⁦@TakedaPharma⁩ facilities in ⁦@BrooklynPark⁩. Lots of brainpower in #MN03! �
From my memorable conversation w/Martin Luther King, III last year at #WeDay to this morning’s #MLKBreakfastMN, the legacy of Dr. King is living, breathing and as powerful as ever. In his immortal words, “The time is always right to do what is right”. Let’s get to work. #MLKDay⁠
Thank you for the wonderful 50th birthday wishes, roasts, toasts and posts. I’m grateful for the blessings of amazing family, friends, staff, and colleagues on both sides of the aisle. And hair.
@LeaderHoyer Thank you, Steny! The Govenrment Repair Truck is still seeking a co-pilot. Just sayin’.

While I welcome many elements of The President’s proposal, negotiations cannot begin during a shutdown. I believe a bipartisan deal can be reached that satisfies our need for enhanced border security AND immigration reform, but government must be re-opened for that to occur.
At the @WhiteHouse this week, we asked The President to re-open government, pay those who protect us in the skies, on the ground, on the seas, and at our borders - and demand a bipartisan border security immigration reform package from Congress. I hope he does so today. #enough
@calvertsand Thank you, Sandy!��
RT @RBReich: Mitch McConnell calls #HR1 a "power grab" because it would: 1) Begin to overturn Citizens United. 2) Establish Automatic Vot…
TGIF! That means it’s time for my first Friday Follow Up - a review of the past week in Congress.
I never imagined the best endorsement for #HR1 would come from ⁦⁦Sen. McConnell, who opposes: transparency, cleaning-up corruption, voter protection and empowerment, ethics reform, campaign law enforcement enhancement, and campaign finance reform. 
Pleased to announce my assignments to the House Financial Services Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee. Eager to work with my colleagues on both sides to promote truth, justice, opportunity for all, a strong economy, consumer protection improved relations around the globe.
From mtg w/The President at the @WhiteHouse, to voting on bills to open govt, to convening R D colleagues, I’ve spent my first two weeks in Congress working to inspire a cessation of animosity in favor of action. One thing is clear:  it won’t happen w/o Americans demanding it.
Thanks, Tennessee, for showing us what can be achieved when possibility transcends partisanship.
We absolutely must secure our borders and enforce our laws. That’s why the Senate must immediately appropriate money to pay our border officers and agents,@realDonaldTrump should sign it into law and Congress should draft a bipartisan border security immigration reform package.
Actually, Mr. President, many of us are here - reasonable Ds and Rs who want our government open, border and port security enhanced, and immigration system reformed. Why not agree to end the shutdown and demand a comprehensive bill from Congress for your signature? #LetsGetToIt

@realDonaldTrump Hi, Mr. President. I’m in town, too! ��‍️Ready to talk about:a) re-opening our government so federal employees, many of whom ensure our safety and security, get paidb) fixing our broken immigration systemc) securing our bordersd) enhancing port security#letsgetitdone
The longest shutdown in our history is hurting millions and represents yet another stain on our nation. My message to @POTUS Congress is clear: immediately end the shutdown and let’s begin negotiating a comprehensive, bipartisan border security + immigration reform package.
Thoughts and tweets don't save lives; action saves lives. That’s why I cosponsored my second bill yesterday, #HR8, requiring universal background checks on all gun sales. And this morning, we dedicated our cloakroom in honor of @GabbyGiffords and the late Rep. Leo Ryan. #courage
In solidarity with hard-working federal employees who are working without pay or on furlough, I have officially requested that my salary be withheld until the shutdown ends. I’ll divide my #shutdownpay equally, and contribute it to @2harvest, @CornerstoneMN and @VVAmerica.
Americans expect and deserve common sense solutions from effective leaders in both parties. First, the President must end the shutdown immediately. Second, fact-based border security enhancement and humane immigration reform bills must be swiftly debated, passed implemented.
@Rabbijb @RepDean Love that!!
Funny what happens when @RepDean and I sit next to one another at the bi-partisan Congressional Research Service orientation for freshmen!
@scottsphoto And I’m honored to use it, Scott. Thank you!
@Gwen_Michael @KyloInMN Hi, Gwen. I’d be happy to meet and learn about what’s important to you. Send me a direct message and we can get it scheduled asap. Thanks!
Welcome to my official Twitter! On Day 1, we voted on an appropriations package to re-open government. On Day 2, we introduced #HR1 to improve ethics, protect and empower voters, and address the corrupting influence of money in politics. Hitting the ground running #ForThePeople!
