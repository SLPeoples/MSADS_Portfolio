For instance, in my own community of Dearborn, my friends and neighbors have  been targeted just because of their religion. Divided we fall, united we stand. We must rise against it and stand together.
We cannot stifle free speech in this country or allow ourselves to be divided by fear and hatred. Throughout the course of our country’s history, language that is racist, sexist, intolerant, prejudiced, or discriminatory has divided and pitted us  against each other.
I voted in favor of the resolution on the House floor because of those reasons.  The first resolution which was circulated did not strike this balance, which is why I could not support it and worked with my colleagues to change it.
We will not be divided by fear and hatred. Anti-Semitism is unacceptable and will not be tolerated by me or others in the Congress. Equally as unacceptable is Islamophobic rhetoric that threatens many of my Muslim neighbors and is far too common today.
@repdonyoung Don and John Dingell were good friends and shared a passion for the outdoors and often went hunting together. I know John is smiling down at his dear friend and wishing him the best. Best wishes from Michigan’s Twelfth!

This day means more to me than ever. It is important to me to celebrate John by carry on this tradition with our friends, and to focus on what unites us rather than what divides us.
Celebrating John’s heritage on Paczki Day with friends each year has been a reminder to the community that our heritage is important. Traditions such as this keep us connected and tie generations together.
The Dingell family immigrated to the United States from Poland, and Paczki Day is a Polish celebration of Fat Tuesday – the last chance to indulge before the fasting days of Lent.

Our workers do make the best product in the world and I thank @FiatChrysler_NA for their confidence in them.
Hard-working men and women in Michigan are ready to fill these jobs and keep America as a leader in this extremely competitive global marketplace. We can’t get ahead by building in another country and importing back.
Great news for Michigan from @FiatChrysler_NA today. I want to thank them to their commitment to production in the US. Their investment decisions are an important part of keeping this country at the forefront of innovation and technology in transportation and mobility.
The Trump Administration owes Congress answers -- we need to know how many families were separated and their plan to reunify every child with their loved ones.
Our forefathers wrote a strong system of checks and balances between branches of government to protect our democracy.
I joined my colleague @JoaquinCastrotx in introducing a bill to terminate this action which violates the Congress’ exclusive power of the purse. I will vote to support the bill and against this overreach.

Kettles was a pillar of our community and  served as a trusted mentor to veterans after returning home from  Vietnam. His true calling was serving others, and we are all better for knowing him and learning from him.

On this #MLKDay we must remember that, never be afraid to stand up for what’s right and that we have a moral responsibility to speak out and fight against hate.
Dr. King taught that we are intertwined into an “inescapable web of mutuality.” He knew that in our country, it is love and cooperation with our neighbor that makes our democracy possible, gives it vibrancy and opens it up to those left out.

America is better than this. United we stand, divided we fall. I am deeply, deeply saddened by what happened.
I was educated by Catholic nuns and they taught me the value of respecting every individual and recognizing all they have to give and the need to protect that as a basic human value. The fact that these were students at a Catholic High School only makes this worse for me.
