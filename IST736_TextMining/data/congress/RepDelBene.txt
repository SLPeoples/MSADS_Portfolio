Way to go, Lus! #WA01 is rooting for you!
The #ACA provides health coverage for 750,000 Washingtonians. I met with the CEO of the @WAplanfinder and their chief policy officer to discuss how we can further the stabilize the program to ensure that more #WA families benefit.
Today is #InternationalWomensDay, but this is not about one day. This is a lifetime movement that can only end with full equality. Today is about reaffirming our commitment to this worthy fight. We won’t stop, we won’t give up, and together we will prevail. #IWD2019
#HR1 takes power away from corporate and special interests, and gives it back to the people. Today we made history by passing real reforms that ensure every citizen’s right to vote, reduces dark money in our elections cleans up DC corruption. #ForthePeople
My staff had a great meeting with members of @WACounties this week in my DC office. Thank you for your advocacy for all 39 of #WA’s counties!
#WA01 is home to more than 4,000 farms, which is why I was glad to meet with local farmers and ag industry reps to discuss the importance of increased funding for small fruit research.
Enjoyed meeting with @MayorDave of Kenmore! We discussed the importance of investing in the city’s infrastructure ensuring that it’s navigation channel, which local businesses rely on, remains open. Oh, and thanks for the Kenmore mug! #WA01
I am grateful to have a friend and colleague in @RepJohnLewis, who helped lead the movement in the face of violence for the betterment of our country. #goodtrouble
#OTD in 1965, peaceful civil rights protesters began their march for equal rights from Selma to Montgomery, in what became known as #BloodySunday. They were met with clubs and pepper spray, but their perseverance led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
When we invest in the future of young people, we invest in the prosperity of our country. I met with #WA01 representatives for the @BGCCAN, to discuss the importance of educational and workforce readiness programs.
Excited to join my fellow @HouseNewDems in announcing our first coalition-wide endorsement this Congress for #HR1 the #ForthePeopleAct. It’s time to clean up Washington and making voting easier and fairer for ALL Americans.
Today I joined @rosadelauro, @SenatorBennet and @SenSherrodBrown in introducing the American Family Act, which will enhance the Child Tax Credit to create a fairer system that allows parents to invest in their children’s future.
Too many people are facing the difficult reality of raising a family as stagnating wages, higher housing costs student loan debt make it harder for parents to give their children the opportunities they need to succeed.

Honored to speak at @CSIS, where I discussed how the U.S. needs to be more active in the creation of global standards for the digital economy. This includes passing a strong privacy law that protects consumers doesn’t limit the ability of entrepreneurs to innovate.
The first mobile office hours of 2019 start tomorrow! If you are a #WA01 resident and need assistance with a federal agency, my staff will be in locations throughout King County this week. Click the link for more info:
If you are a #WA01 resident in need of assistance with a federal agency, look no further! My staff will be offering mobile office hours across King County next week from Tuesday through Friday. See below for details.
Selma, AL has a special place in my heart. I was born here, and it’s also where my friend civil rights hero @RepJohnLewis other activists crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge while facing brutal opposition to their peaceful pursuit for civil rights.
I just visited the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, where we remembered the many victims of lynching. #FPICivilRights

From aerospace to agriculture, manufacturing plays a critical role in nearly every industry sector, helping steer Washington’s economy. I met with @ImpactWA, a non-profit organization working hard to guarantee #WA’s manufacturing industry remains vibrant. #WA01
This morning I toured the Capitol dome with family and staff. It’s a beautiful reminder of our collective responsibility to cherish our nation’s history and continue to work hard on behalf of its people. Check out the incredible views at the top!
This is case-in-point why we need strong consumer privacy legislation. One thing my bill would do is require companies to write their private policies in plain English and explain exactly how and with whom their private data will be shared.
Background checks on gun sales only work if they’re actually completed. Today we passed #HR1112 to close the #CharlestonLoophole by extending the initial FBI background check review from 3 to 10 business days. This will give authorities the time to do their job help save lives.
Thanks to representatives alums from @College_Success for stopping by and outlining their educational priorities for 2019. They are doing important work to ensure everyone with the drive to work hard can go to college, regardless of their income.
As a mom, I’m sick of seeing innocent lives lost due to gun violence. Today the House took action passed #HR8, a bipartisan bill I cosponsored that includes universal background checks – a positive step toward keeping our communities safe saving lives.
I spoke with representatives from the Washington State Potato Commission on how to maintain a thriving agricultural industry for #WA farmers. Washington state ranks second in the nation for potato production, making it a major part of our agricultural economy.
I enjoyed a productive meeting with Snohomish community leaders and elected officials, where we discussed how to strengthen cybersecurity and promote cleaner energy use in our region. Thank you for visiting me in the “other Washington!” #WA01
#LWCF is one of our country’s most important programs - contributing over $675 million to #WA’s economy while protecting national parks, waterways wildlife. Today, I joined my House colleagues in voting to permanently reauthorize #LWCF.
My thanks to @NWHarvest, @FoodLifeline, @UnitedWayKC, @MomsRising, @HIP, @KCPubHealth, and Little Church on Prairie Learning Center for visiting me today. Together we discussed the importance of fighting hunger in our region.
These allegations are horrific. We must get to the bottom of what happened and make sure everyone responsible is held accountable under the law. We’re talking about innocent children.
#OTD in 1870, Hiram Revels of Mississippi became our nation’s first African American U.S. Senator. He was also a dedicated educator to black students during reconstruction. Today we honor his perseverance and trailblazing achievements. #BlackHistoryMonth
I agree. The only way to ensure the American people know the full truth about Russian interference and possible collusion with the Trump campaign during the 2016 election is to make the complete Mueller report public.
Like all of my colleagues, I’ve taken an oath to uphold the Constitution. This week I’m joining @HouseDemocrats to pass a resolution ending this #FakeEmergency, staying true to that oath. I hope the Senate will follow suit.
We must have safeguards in place for our personal data. My legislation would strengthen consumer privacy by giving consumers the ability to “opt-in” to sharing data and requiring companies to disclose how that data is shared.
It was a pleasure to present awards at the 32nd Annual County Math Championship in Blaine. Congratulations to the winners – I always enjoy seeing the talent and passion for STEM in #WA01 students!
Appreciate everyone in Blaine who showed up for our community forum. I’ll keep working hard on your behalf. #WA01
Thanks to everyone in Mount Vernon for attending today’s community forum. Let’s do it again soon! #WA01
Last call! I’m hosting two community forums today – one in Mt. Vernon at 9:30am and one in Blaine at 11:45am. Details here:
The government shouldn’t stand between a woman and her doctor. Trump’s dangerous gag rule pushes Planned Parenthood out of Title X and jeopardizes the reproductive health care of 4 million women and men who depend on this program. I #standwithPP in strongly opposing the gag rule.
Attention Skagit and Whatcom residents! Tomorrow I’m hosting a community forum in Mt. Vernon at 9:30am and one in Blaine at 11:45am. I want to take your questions AND your answers, so I hope to see you there. Click the link to RSVP for location
Cleared for takeoff! Can’t wait to see the ways @FlyPaineField will expand travel options and help our region’s economic growth.
Today I joined @SenatorCantwell along with local and environmental leaders at @MountaineersOrg to celebrate the Senate’s permanent reauthorization of #LWCF. Now it’s the House’s turn to do our job and renew this critical program that serves us so well.
The #LWCF has contributed more than $600M to #WA’s economy. The program is devoted to helping fund local parks, farms, sports fields, fishing, wildlife viewing, and of course our national parks that include beautiful mountains, waterways, and forests.
Happy Birthday to my dear friend, @RepJohnLewis! Here’s to many more years of making #goodtrouble!

In King county alone, housing prices have increased by more than 200 percent. @MayorJenny’s actions are an important step in addressing the affordable housing crisis in our region and expanding the middle-class.
I love Reily everyday, but in honor of #LoveYourPetDay, I want to show appreciation for the best four-legged member of my family!
Had a blast co-teaching with Brigitte Tennis at Stella Schola Middle School! It’s always exciting to see students’ curiosity and interest in learning firsthand! #WA01
Visited the @AllenInstitute this afternoon to find out more about the innovative research they’re doing in brain science and autoimmune diseases. Great to see such breakthrough work happening in #WA.
Today I had the honor of visiting @USCG sector Puget Sound to meet with Coast Guardsmen and learn more about their operations. We all owe them a debt of gratitude for their service throughout our region.
I met with members of the WA Alliance for Retired Americans at my Bothell office. We talked about ways that Congress can protect and expand the programs and benefits that older Americans count on. Thanks for stopping by!
A strong, vibrant economy should work for everyone. The @WaysMeansCmte is addressing the plight of the middle class head-on. We started this week with a hearing focused on just that.
Happy Anniversary to my husband, Kurt! Looking forward to many more adventures in the years to come!
If Trump wants comprehensive immigration reform, he needs to work with Congress. Declaring a national emergency to build his ill-conceived border wall is reckless, undermines our rule of law, and sets a dangerous precedent.
It’s not just wages that are stagnating, families are struggling to keep up with rising housing costs and health care bills. The middle class is the backbone of our economy and I will keep pushing for policies that strengthen and expand our middle class.
Thank you @SenatorCantwell for this victory that will help protect our nation’s public lands.
Today, I reintroduced the National Landslide Preparedness Act along with @SenatorCantwell to protect vulnerable communities from the devastation our region experienced. I will commit all my efforts to getting this bill passed for the people of Oso.
I remember the horrors of the tragic landslide near Oso in 2014 which took 43 precious lives. It was one of my saddest days in Congress. This tragedy highlighted the need to invest in technology land mapping to prevent future natural disasters from becoming national tragedies.
One year ago, these 17 beautiful souls lost their lives at the #ParklandSchoolShooting. We remember them, and honor them, by continuing to fight for commonsense gun laws to prevent these senseless tragedies. #NotOneMore #EndGunViolence
Wishing everyone in #WA01 a Happy Valentine’s Day!
Happy birthday to @RepRichardNeal! Thank you for your inspiring leadership on @WaysMeansCmte.
Exciting news for #WA01! This will mean more fun programs for #WA families and the expansion of important scientific research in the North Cascades.
Nearly 1 in 4 Washingtonians spend half their income on rent. I sought answers at a @WaysMeansCmte hearing to better understand how the lack of safe, affordable housing is impacting middle class families, seniors, veterans and young people.
Today I joined my colleagues in reintroducing the Assault Weapons Ban. Tomorrow is the anniversary of the Parkland shooting, and no bills have passed to address the nearly 1,200 gun-related deaths since that tragic day. We must enact common sense gun safety legislation now.
Today me and my colleagues are wearing red to raise awareness about heart disease. It’s a chronic disease that claims the lives of 1 in 5 women in #WA. Take the time to know your risk factors and take important preventative measures.
For many Americans, access to affordable prescription drugs is the difference between life death. Congress must work to ensure medicine is accessible affordable. In today’s @WaysMeansCmte hearing, I spoke up for #WA01 families seniors struggling to pay for medicine.
Community colleges play an important role in helping folks gain highly sought skills. Thanks to @EdmondsCC, @BatesTechnical @EverettCC for talking with me about how local community colleges can better serve veterans strengthen workforce development. #WA01

Rejecting anti-Semitism and prejudice toward any religion is the duty of all Americans. I am pleased that Rep. Omar has apologized for her offensive words and hope we can use this moment to reflect and move forward.
So proud of my former congressional fellow! We miss Katherine’s sharp wit and sense of humor, but we’re so excited about the important work she’s doing at @UW on data privacy.
What an important project for our region. People struggling to get back on their feet often need comprehensive services. These resources ensure folks not only have a safe and affordable place to live, but can fully prosper and live independently.
Happy #WomeninScienceDay! I’m glad I had the resources to pursue a career in STEM. It’s crucial that we continue to expand opportunity that sparks young girls’ interest in STEM and can lead to exciting careers.
RIP to my colleague Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina. My prayers are with his family.

So sad about the passing of Congressman John Dingell. He leaves an incredible legacy after almost 60 years serving in the House.
This is the result of the reckless @GOP tax bill House Republicans jammed through Congress promising it would be easier for taxpayers to manage. The truth is hardworking families are enduring needless confusion and anxiety.
More than 1/3 of US workers are in the “gig economy” – like driving Lyft or assembling furniture – and lack access to traditional benefits. My legislation would create a grant program to help implement evaluate new models to provide portable benefits to contingent workers.
As someone who needed financial assistance for college, I know the impact grants can have on a person’s life. Today I sat down with @NWIC to discuss how we make sure Tribal Colleges Universities have the resources to help #WA students thrive.
Scientific research has revolutionized cancer treatment. Chimeric Antigen Receptor Therapies (CAR T) are innovative but costly. I talked with reps from @SeattleCCA about how shifting Medicare's reimbursement structure can ensure precision medicine is available for seniors.

Look who we stumbled upon! Honored to join @SpeakerPelosi and my #SOTU guest Yasmin Ali in wearing white to pay respect to Suffragettes as we continue our fight for #equalpay and equal opportunities for women in America. #StateoftheWoman
To remedy this, she founded @SkillSpire2016, which is committed to strengthening the STEM pipeline for underrepresented #WA communities. I'm thrilled to have her join me at the #SOTU, and to celebrate the contributions immigrants make to our society.
Yasmin helped establish still volunteers for the Muslim Association of Puget Sound (MAPS), starting a night school that has served over 1000 Muslim students. While at MAPS, she found students who wanted to work in the IT industry but who lacked the training resources.
Here I am with my friend and #SOTU guest Yasmin Ali of Redmond. Yasmin embodies what it means to be an American. She's a mom and community leader who moved to the U.S. from India seeking a better life, and has dedicated her life to helping others.
To everyone in #WA01 celebrating, Happy Lunar New Year! 2019 is the #YearOfThePig. Fun Fact: The pig symbolizes optimism, enthusiasm and hard work.
I had a productive meeting with @TASKuon of @icw and Father Stephen V. Sundborg of @seattleu. We discussed the importance of ensuring #WA students at independent colleges have access to the best educational opportunities.
Today we remember civil rights leader and American icon Rosa Parks. Her refusal to leave her seat after a long day’s work helped spark the Montgomery Bus Boycotts. We honor her courage and conviction in the pursuit of justice.
Glad the @nytimes agrees we need strong privacy legislation. My bill requires companies to write privacy agreements in plain English, allow consumers to opt-in after they agree to these easy-to-read policies, give the FTC authority to enforce these

If we want to maintain a strong economy, we need a strong middle class. Too many families are struggling with stagnant wages. To ensure that all Americans are thriving, we must expand economy opportunity.
Today, I joined elected officials and community leaders at the ribbon cutting for the SR 99 corridor. I am going to miss the beautiful views from the Alaskan Way Viaduct, but look forward to the end of #viadoom.

There are three million Washingtonians living with pre-existing conditions. During a @WaysMeansCmte hearing, I highlighted how ACA plans are protecting consumers and how junk plans permitted by the Trump administration fail to provide adequate coverage.
I agree. Congress has a responsibility to pass bipartisan immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship, a permanent solution for Dreamers – and yes – smart border security that doesn’t include a wasteful border wall.
In honor of the 10th anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, I’m proud to stand with @HouseDemocrats in re-introducing the #PaycheckFairness Act. When women succeed, America succeeds. #Equalpay for equal work is long overdue, so let’s get it done. #Ledbetter10
The effects of the shutdown are still causing anxiety for thousands of contractors who work low-wage jobs. Hardworking families shouldn’t have to ration food. This is a costly lesson for why government shutdowns must be avoided.

These are just the monetary costs of the government shutdown. The family costs are so much worse. The president already let innocent people be used as pawns in his desire to build a wasteful border wall. He should not make the same mistake twice.
Truly alarming. Yet another reason we need strong consumer privacy laws so that you control your information and know how it is being used. My privacy legislation would ensure user protection and promote stronger transparency. #DataPrivacyDay
Happy Birthday to my @WaysMeansCmte colleague, @RepLindaSanchez!
It’s #DataPrivacyDay! Here’s what my privacy legislation would do to protect consumers’ most personal, sensitive information from being misused by bad actors.
Today we remember the more than six million Jews who died during the Holocaust. We will never forget these atrocities, and recommit to fighting for a more peaceful and inclusive world that respects everyone regardless of religion.
In King County alone, housing prices have more than doubled since 2012. I am introducing legislation this Congress to expand the affordable housing tax credit which will help #WA working families obtain safe, affordable housing.
Today’s news, and this list of people, is why Special Counsel Mueller’s probe must continue unimpeded. Congress the American people deserve all the facts about Russian interference in our election, and whether the President was also involved.
The President is finally ending his government shutdown. However, it’s sad that it took 35 days of families needlessly suffering for the President to do what’s right. It never had to happen and he must never do this again.
Read more about my bill to repeal the Cadillac Tax, which hits working #WA01 families due to factors beyond their control such as age, geography, or job occupation. It’s an unfair tax against families who get their health insurance through their employers.
Snapped a photo with our growing group of Dem women on @WaysMeansCmte. Looking forward to working with @RepGwenMoore, @RepTerriSewell, @RepJudyChu, @RepLindaSanchez and @RepStephMurphy on health care, taxes, retirement and trade to help working families. Let’s get to work!
Thank you to Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin Deputy Mayor Nick Harper for visiting me in the “other Washington.” We discussed how to foster growth in Everett while also outlining priorities for Everett’s Naval Station.
Yet another tone-deaf statement by an administration that doesn’t understand what working families are going through. They’re going to food banks because President Trump has cut off their ability to afford groceries. It’s that simple. Open the government.
A prime example of how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting local workers and jeopardizing economic growth in our region. #WA families can’t afford to wait any longer. President Trump must end the shutdown now.
The Trump shutdown is causing serious and unnecessary harm to our economy. The President must stop playing politics and reopen the government immediately.
Congress must pass legislation to protect consumer privacy. My bill would give consumers the control to opt-in to sharing their data w/private companies, which would be audited to ensure they are following the law protecting people’s most sensitive data.
46 years later, Roe v. Wade still plays a vital role in ensuring women have autonomy over their bodies. We’ve made progress, but the Trump administration’s endless attacks on women's reproductive rights undermine that progress. We must continue to #FightforRoe. #Roe46
It’s Day 32 of the #TrumpShutdown, and #WA firefighters now lack the resources to keep our communities safe from wildfires. Trump needs to put the welfare of families first and reopen the government today.
My Oh My, Edgar’s in!!Congratulations @11EdgarMartinez on your induction into the @baseballhall!
I should also add that Kaylee, a community liaison in my Mount Vernon office, volunteered today at the food bank. Thanks to all of the volunteers for helping #WA federal workers during this difficult time.

I'm grateful @FoodLifeline serves as a vital resource in the community. But let’s be clear, the shutdown needs to end so #WA families don’t have to live in fear of not being able to feed their children.
Across #WA, the Trump shutdown is hitting folks hard. Many #WA federal employees are being forced to use food banks to keep food on the table. I volunteered at @FoodLifeline today to help sort package food.
#OTD, we honor a revolutionary. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr’s courage paved the way for equal rights for African-Americans. Let today serve as a reminder of the progress we’ve made towards equality, but that our work is far from over.
These are just some of the stories my office has heard since the #TrumpShutdown. It’s heart wrenching that #WA01 families are suffering from a perfectly avoidable situation. The President needs to do his job reopen the government.
Enjoyed meeting with #WA01 representatives of our conservation and recreation organizations. Thank you for the work you do to preserve our beautiful #WA landscape!
If true, this would be one of the most serious offenses committed by the President. We must get to the bottom of this to determine if the President ordered Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. The American people deserve answers.
In addition to hardworking #WA01 government employees missing pay, the shutdown strains resources used to help our #WA ecosystem. Our orcas are in a critical state. Another reason the shutdown must end.
The carelessness shown to immigrant children by this administration is beyond disturbing. My heart breaks for these children and their families. Congress must demand answers.
Today, I spoke up for the small business in my district that laid off 20 percent of its workers due to the #TrumpShutdown. @HouseDemocrats have passed several spending bills this month. It’s time for Trump to put American workers first reopen the government.
This isn’t just lost income. This is missed rent, skipped medical bills, and the inability to buy groceries to feed a family. This is the pain many Americans are feeling because of the #TrumpShutdown, and there’s no justification for it.
I’ve been hearing directly from #WA01 air traffic controllers, DHS workers, and other federal employees who aren’t getting paid but are still working. One man has a disabled son who requires $1500 a month in medical expenses. It has to stop. Mr. President, #EndTheShutdown.
I’m excited to be named to the Select Revenue Measures, Trade and Oversight subcommittees in the @WaysMeansCmte! These subcommittees cover some of the most important issues in the lives of #WA01 families. Can’t wait to get started.
Pleased with this decision. Adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census could hurt its accuracy undermine its overall effectiveness by scaring people into not participating. This could rob poorer communities of the vital resources they need.
The Trump administration’s attacks on women’s reproductive rights must end. Today I joined the @ProChoiceCaucus to highlight the importance of defending access to contraception and family planning services from this president’s hostile actions.
Like all Americans, I want meaningful border security, but a wasteful and ineffective border wall is not the answer. This is the President’s shutdown, and his actions continue to hurt countless Americans. He must #EndTheShutdown.

It was an honor to be a part of this special project commemorating the women of the 116th Congress. These truly are groundbreaking times for women in government.
Pete, thank you. You are not alone. There are 5.7 million people in the U.S. with Alzheimer's and that number is expected to nearly triple by 2050. This bill’s passage will improve care for patients as we work towards a cure.
An important victory, but we still have a long way to go. No one has the right to interfere with women’s private health decisions.
This hurts the entire country and it doesn’t need to happen. The president must end this shutdown now.
It’s Day 24 of the #TrumpShutdown and so many families are suffering the consequences. Recently I met with #WA01 housing agencies, transportation providers and small businesses who are also impacted.
Today, we honor Korean-Americans across the country and reflect on their tremendous contributions to our society. I am proud to represent the #PNW, a region with rich diversity and a thriving #KoreanAmerican population.
Needless to say, people are worried and want the government to reopen quickly. I implore the president to heed this advice and reopen our government. Too much is at stake for hardworking families and small businesses.
The #TrumpShutdown is causing anxiety throughout #WA01. Today I met with @MyCommTrans, @UWBGov, HASCO, and Tethers Unlimited to better learn how folks are being affected by the shutdown.
#WA01 residents – keep up what I’m doing in the “other Washington” by following me on Instagram and Facebook! Search for me using @RepDelBene!
Great to see my alma mater develop a potentially life-saving app. Using innovative technology could be a promising step in preventing opioid overdoses in #WA.
To sustain economic growth, companies must have a strong talent pool. Trump’s anti-immigrant policies drive away talented workers. Immigrants helped make the US the greatest country in the world. We must make comprehensive immigration reform a top
They protect our skies, secure our borders, inspect our food, help our farmers perform countless other duties that keep our country strong. Today they’ll wonder how to pay rent or put food on the table. It’s a sad day. Mr. President, open the government.

Worker paychecks, housing benefits, and infrastructure funding. These are just some of the ways the shutdown is impacting #WA residents. Trump needs to reopen the government.
I can’t think of anything more hurtful for the men and women who defend our great country. They protect our freedoms. We should protect their livelihoods. If the president is serious about protecting the homeland he would do his job and reopen the government.
Here’s a prime example of the #TrumpShutdown hitting home. On top of impacting #WA federal workers, the shutdown could also stifle local economic growth.
As more information is revealed about the Trump’s campaign’s relationship with the Russians, it makes protecting the Mueller investigation that much more imperative. The American people deserve the facts.
Presidential addresses are meant to discuss critical issues at our nation's forefront. Instead, Trump used it to stoke fear mislead the public. The President needs to do his job stop holding our government hostage over an ill conceived border wall.
This is what happens when our own president calls climate change a “hoax.” We can’t afford not to #ActonClimate. Future generations depend on the actions that we take today.
The #TrumpShutdown is affecting countless families. I want to hear your stories so I can help. Contact my office today if you live in #WA01.
If you are a #WA federal employee impacted by the govt shutdown, you can apply for benefits at or by phone at 800-318-6022. Please be prepared to verify your employment with a pay stub or W-2 form. For more information, click here:
97% of gun owners supports universal background checks. I’m pleased this bipartisan legislation is being introduced today in the House in the hopes of saving innocent lives from senseless gun violence.
#WA workers and their families shouldn’t have to miss a paycheck because the president is unwilling to back down from his demands. @HouseDemocrats have moved bills to open up the government continue negotiations. The president needs to stop being reckless and come to the table.
My privacy bill would have consumers opt in before companies can access their private data, and would require companies to disclose if and with whom data will be shared. We deserve transparency. I’ll keep working to get my bill passed this Congress.
We’re not just talking about “food stamps.” This is about ensuring families in search of work have access to good, nutritious meals and that children don’t go to school on empty stomachs. Anything less is unacceptable.
Yet another outrageous proposal by this administration. This is dangerous thinking that could leave families and children more vulnerable to discrimination in the housing market and at school.
The playoffs are here! #GoHawks!!#SEAvsDAL #Imin
The President should follow @HouseDemocrats example and reopen the government now. At the end of the year the Senate passed the same legislation by unanimous consent.
The President says he’s fine letting the U.S. economy suffer for ”months or years” over his wasteful, misguided and ineffective border wall. Real leaders don’t negotiate by holding their own government hostage.
I also helped reintroduce the Hold Congress Accountable Act last week. Members of Congress shouldn’t get paid if other federal employees aren’t getting paid.
While President Trump keeps the government closed over his wasteful, immoral border wall, I have decided to donate my salary to the @NWIRP. They do important work keeping immigrant families together while fighting for justice.
This is a great read with important ideas on how we can fight addiction to opioids. Congress passed meaningful legislation last year, but the work continues in the #116thCongress.
Inspired to join the Democratic women of the 116th Congress this morning for a group photo outside the Capitol. Let’s keep making history. Also found time for a quick pic with my friends @RepKimSchrier, @RepKatieHill and @RepFletcher.

The shutdown means tax refunds are at risk of being delayed and 800,000 workers are either being furloughed or working without pay. This needlessly hurts hardworking Americans and our economy. #ForThePeople
This is what governing looks like. @HouseDemocrats just passed a bill to reopen the government. It’s time for the Senate GOP and President Trump to be responsible and stop holding the government hostage.
