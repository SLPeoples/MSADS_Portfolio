For 6 yrs, @RepPerlmutter and I have been working to let marijuana businesses access banking services. This week, we reintroduced our bill, the SAFE Banking Act, w/ 108 cosponsorsLet's strengthen public safety by letting these businesses open bank accountsLet's pass this bill
This #InternationalWomensDay, we must remember that we have a responsibility to protect human rights at home and abroad. That’s why I co-sponsored the #ReproRightsAreHumanRights Act, which requires the @StateDept to reinstate #reprorights into its annual Human Rights Reports.
One of the most important things I’ve learned in my career is that the institution of democracy is only as strong as the faith that people put in it. It's time for Congress to earn back the people’s trust by ensuring that every citizen has a voice in their government.
Today, I was proud to join my House colleagues to pass the #ForThePeople Act, a historic bill that will restore the faith and function of American democracy by reducing the role of money in politics and ending the culture of corruption.

It’s an honor to collaborate with the City of Tumwater to share her story with our community. Read more:
Today, in honor of #WomensHistoryMonth, I introduced a bill to designate the #Tumwater Post Office for Eva G. Hewitt, Tumwater's first female postmaster. Eva was a dedicated postmaster and businesswoman, and she’s earned her place in the South Sound’s history books.
March is #WomensHistoryMonth – a time to recognize and celebrate the incredible women who have changed the world. There is still work to do, and we must continue fighting for gender equality!
Today is #ReadAcrossAmerica Day �. But that didn’t stop me last week from reading Green Eggs Ham to students at Chloe Clark Elementary in DuPont. Thanks for the invitation, Principal Yoho and @SteillySchools1 Superintendent Weight!
You outdid yourself, #WA10! Even in the midst of #WinterStormMaya, my office received more than 11,600 valentines from local students to distribute to veterans and first responders. That’s a 2.4% increase from last year.Thanks to all who joined me in thanking our local heroes!

I will be on @OutFrontCNN with Erin Burnett soon to talk about Michael Cohen's return to Congress.
We can’t afford efforts to make gun violence prevention a partisan issue. Americans demand action to #EndGunViolence. We must make the Bipartisan Background Checks Act law.
More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks. I'm voting today to support #HR8, a bipartisan bill to #EndGunViolence and expand background checks.
Our current background check system has already stopped more than 3 million sales to convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers. Today, I am proud to stand with my colleagues in Congress to help save lives by passing universal background checks. #HR8
Americans are 25 times more likely to be killed by a gun than people in other developed countries. We can defend the 2nd Amendment and still find that unacceptable. #EndGunViolence
Today, Congress is taking bipartisan action to keep communities safe by passing #HR8. We must #EndGunViolence because one life lost to gun violence is one too many.

Gun violence costs each American taxpayer about $700 each year. For families who lose a loved one, the loss is immeasurable. We all pay some price by doing nothing. Today we will pass #HR8, a bill that will help save lives and help #EndGunViolence.

This will be the first National Heritage Area in the Pacific Northwest and will help our local communities protect and promote their shoreline treasures for generations to come. Read more on our bill:
The package includes the Maritime Washington National Heritage Area Act, a bill that I’ve been working on for years alongside my friend colleague @RepDerekKilmer. Our proposal designates a majority of Western WA's shoreline as a National Heritage Area.
Today, the House passed its biggest public lands package in decades. This package is a huge win for public lands nationwide—for one, it permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF)—but it’s also a huge win for Washington state.
These questions all link back to developing a growing economy that expands the pie for everyone, and I’m committed to drilling down to shape economic policies that match our economic reality.
Since entering Congress, I’ve used my position to ask the relevant questions about our economy to both Democratic and Republican Administrations. When will America get a raise? When will more Americans be able to achieve homeownership?
I am extremely excited to nerd out about economic policy with @RepMaloney, @RepBeatty, @RepDonBeyer, @RepLoisFrankel @RepDavidTrone in our roles on @JECDems, along with the other Senators and House members (@JECRepublicans) that will serve on the Joint Economic Committee.

Now seems like a good moment to share that I’m on Instagram! Check out some photos from the #SOTU and my guest, Jon from Puyallup:
What are some of your priorities you hope to hear from President @realdonaldtrump tonight in the #SOTU? In our representative democracy, your voice is important.
We need to be prepared and committed to effectively combat Russian  aggression through strict #sanctions and with strong #cybersecurity operations and investments.
We also cannot make progress together if the President does not acknowledge the threat that Russia poses to Western democracies, including our own.
The #health of each and every American is also important to our country’s success. The President should provide a plan for how we can stabilize the health insurance marketplace and lower prescription drug costs, so that Americans of every age can afford good quality #healthcare.
The President would also be smart to address the state of our nation’s #infrastructure. If we want to end this cycle of slow economic growth, we have to provide forward-looking federal investments in our roads, ports, bridges, stormwater systems and utilities.
I've invited a guest from #WA10 to accompany me to the #SOTU His family includes a federal employee who was directly affected by the latest government shutdown. President Trump needs to remember these families when he makes decisions on bipartisan government funding bills.
First and foremost, I want the President to express his openness to a long-term bipartisan strategy to keep the federal government open. Our union cannot be strong when families are denied timely paychecks for a hard day’s work. #TrumpShutdown
Like many of you watching at home, I have certain priorities that I hope he mentions in his #SOTU remarks.

While I wish this agreement hadn’t taken 35 days and harmed hundreds of thousands of people as well as our economy, I am encouraged by this bipartisan agreement. It is a step in the right direction.

Today marks 90 years since the birth of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. If you read one thing today, make it this article written by my colleague @RepMcEachin:
If you have a #ShutdownStory to share, please email me on my website
I am committed to opening the government and securing our borders. Over the past 2 weeks, I have voted for several bills to do just that. Today, I voted on a bill to continue funding through Feb. 1, giving Senate Republicans the President another opportunity to #EndTheShutdown
I’ve received #ShutdownStories from constituents like Helen from Edgewood, who believes that we can do better than building a wall.
I’ve received #ShutdownStories from federal employees like Steven, who just wants to work in the job he loves and be able to put food on the table and pay the bills.
I’ve received #ShutdownStories from people like Jeannemarie from Puyallup, who is relying on food pantries for the first time in her life.
This shutdown has real, devastating consequences for federal employees (a good number of whom are veterans) who are either furloughed or working without pay. Federal employees in #WA10 are facing these consequences and sharing their #ShutdownStories with me.
Second, this shutdown is about a president trying to abuse the system to get his way on a policy difference. I am committed to crossing the aisle to keep the government open, but I do not want to condone this abuse of the process.
At the last minute, the White House changed its request to $5.7 billion for a border wall. The White House has still not submitted a comprehensive plan on how it intends to spend the $5.7 billion.
First, this shutdown is rooted in a disagreement about how to best provide border security. Ds Rs agreed to $1.6 bil in border security, which is the amount requested in the President's budget. It included investments in drug-detecting equipment more border security personnel

Just yesterday I invited a freshman Republican from Texas into my office (he will be moving in there for our next Congress). In the spirit of our 41st President, I hope we can work together to build an economy and national security apparatus of which we can all be proud.
I had the privilege to meet President H. W. Bush. Despite our policy differences, he was a very gracious and kind person.
President George Herbert Walker Bush was our last combat veteran to serve in the highest office in the land. He was one of the finest members of the Greatest Generation, entering public service following a decorated career as a Navy pilot in World War II.
Helping ease the transition between military and civilian careers is one of my top priorities. Happy to report that the Army can now pay for soldiers to get professional credentials that directly correlate to their jobs.
