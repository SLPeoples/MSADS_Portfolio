Today, Congress finally took a step forward in hopes of ensuring that government works better for the American people. Check out my full statement on why I support H.R. 1: #ForThePeople
It also includes bipartisan legislation that I lead to reform the FEC and shine light on the murky world of political advertising. #ForThePeople
I spoke on the House floor this week about why I support H.R. 1 – a bill that will protect voting rights, strengthen ethics rules to ensure that public officials serve the public interest, and reduce the role of big money in politics...
I really enjoyed meeting with representatives from the Boys Girls Clubs of the Olympic Peninsula this week. We talked about the need to support mentoring programs, youth workforce readiness, and child nutrition programs. Count me as a partner! @BGCA_Clubs
On this day in 1965, @repjohnlewis led a 600 person protest march from Selma to Montgomery to elevate the issue of voting rights. I was honored to join him last weekend and follow in his footsteps to reflect on the sacrifice of the civil rights pilgrimage on Bloody Sunday
Congress must continue to support these programs to provide financial certainty for our rural counties and help create more economic opportunities in the communities they serve.
The funding provided by SRS and PILT supports vital county services like investing in job-creating infrastructure, hiring police officers and attracting great teachers for the region’s kids.
These two federal programs help support local government services in rural timber-dependent communities and areas with large federal land ownership by offsetting lost tax revenue from nontaxable federal lands.
Proud to stand with advocates from Washington state and @NACoTweets to advocate for Congress to protect funding for the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) and Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) programs.
Today is a proud day for the New Democrat Coalition. As we continue to broaden our ranks, @HouseNewDems are excited to lead the way on policy by endorsing two of the top legislative priorities for the Democratic Caucus – H.R. 1 and H.R. 4. #ForThePeople

Thank you @repjohnlewis and the Faith and Politics Institute for an educational and memorable weekend on the civil rights pilgrimage! #FPICivilRights @FaithNPolitics
Eventually the Alabama National Guard was nationalized and the siege ended. Thanks to Pastor Baxter Morris for welcoming us.  #FPICivilRights
In May of 1961, the church hosted 1500 worshipers and activists when a mob threatened to burn it to the ground and lobbed in rocks and tear gas. MLK, John Lewis and others asked Attorney General Robert Kennedy to intervene.
Sophie and I just attended the service at the Historic First Baptist Church in Montgomery. In this church, Reverend Ralph Abernathy preached. It was the site of mass meetings to organize the bus boycott and was a refuge for the freedom riders.
We had the honor of laying a wreath at the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Civil Rights Memorial and taking a pledge to continue the fight for justice and equality. #FPICivilRights
While at the church, we heard powerful words of reconciliation from Peggy Wallace Kennedy, the daughter of former Governor George Wallace, as well as from Caroline Kennedy, daughter of John F Kennedy.  #FPICivilRights
Visited Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, where Dr. King was pastor and organized the Montgomery bus boycotts.

On March 7, 1965, John Lewis led a 600 person protest march from Selma to Montgomery to elevate the issue of voting rights. They were stopped at the Edmund Pettus Bridge - sprayed with teargas and beaten with clubs.
We visited the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, the nation’s first memorial dedicated to the the human loss suffered during the era of racial lynching. #FPICivilRights
There was a powerful performance of a play about the 4 young girls who lost their lives in this church following a bombing. We also heard from @SenDougJones who prosecuted two of the men who perpetrated this terrible act. Stay tuned for more updates this weekend #FPICivilRights
Sophie and I will be in Alabama over these next few days with my colleague @repjohnlewis on a Civil Rights Pilgrimage. We started the day with a visit to the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama.
Last week, I was fortunate to attend the Asia Pacific Cultural Center’s 21st Annual New Year Celebration in Tacoma, featuring the beautiful island and culture of Hawaii! It was a beautiful ceremony, as always, thanks so much for having me! Can’t wait to see you all again soon.

Thanks for stopping by!
If you saw my front yard, you might wonder why I was invited to address the @theGCAmerica yesterday… Jokes aside, it was an honor to meet advocates for our environment natural areas, and great to see my friends from the Tacoma Seattle Garden Clubs in DC! Thanks for having me
From the permanent re-authorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, to the creation of Washington’s first two National Heritage Areas, this bill represents a huge win for Washington state! 
The bipartisan #PublicLands package delivers on our region’s long-standing priorities to protect our environment and support continued access to our public lands for generations to come.
Growing up on the Olympic Peninsula, I’ve seen firsthand how our public lands have captivated both visitors and residents alike and served as key economic drivers for our local communities.
One of the most sacred rights as an American is the right to vote. I’m proud to join @RepTerriSewell and @repjohnlewis as a co-sponsor of the Voting Rights Advancement Act to strengthen election transparency and ensure equal access to the ballot box. Congress must #RestoreTheVote
Today, I'm excited to vote for a #PublicLands package that will permanently reauthorize the #LWCF, boost rural economies, and allow future generations to continue to enjoy our natural landscapes. Stay tuned for more!
Thanks @RepStephMurphy – glad to have you as a partner and leader on this issue!
I’m proud to be a champion of our National Parks and I agree with Pew: Congress must take action to allow our National Parks and public lands to continue to provide amazing visitor experiences and serve as economic drivers for our rural communities
Great check-in with members of the Pierce County Central Labor Council’s executive board. We talked about the importance of infrastructure investment, retirement security, workforce development and other efforts to create more economic opportunity. Lots to do!

It was wrong that the 2017 #TaxScam opened up the Arctic for oil and gas drilling. It violates the rights of the Gwich'in people, worsens climate change, and threatens local ecosystems. That's why I'm a cosponsor of the Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act!
Americans deserve a government that works, and I'm excited the new Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress has announced its new members. Welcome aboard! I'm pumped to start working towards bipartisan change to get Congress working for the people again.
I spoke this morning about how the federal government must uphold its treaty and trust obligation to Native American communities, and also work to combat the enormous risk that climate change poses to our region. This is non-negotiable.
How cool is this? (pun intended...) #WomenInScienceDay
We must be vigilant in speaking out against harmful rhetoric by people in both parties. I’m pleased to see Rep. Omar has apologized. Our politics should be free of anti-Semitic rhetoric.
One of the more disturbing elements in our country today is the rising use of anti-Semitic rhetoric. I never thought I would see the day when an American President would declare that people chanting anti-Semitic rhetoric were “very fine people.”
I joined my fellow @SEEC members for a discussion with @SpeakerPelosi and @USRepKCastor about our priorities for combating the #climatecrisis, including reaffirming our commitment to the #ParisAccord, investing in green infrastructure, and creating more green-collar jobs.

When folks feel farther and farther apart when some feel left behind--ideologically and economically--we are following the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s example and saying: We see you, we are with you, we are going to join together to make our country better, right now.

It’s important to restore public faith in our democracy. Protecting voting rights, strengthening ethics rules to ensure that public officials serve the public interest, and reducing the role of big money in politics are vital first steps. #HR1 does all these things. ���️�
Americans deserve to know who is paying for the political ads they see online, and we deserve to know that the nation’s election watchdog is walking the beat and protecting our democracy.
I’m excited that the first bill the House has taken up this year, #HR1, includes two bipartisan proposals for which I’ve advocated- the #HonestAds Act and a bill that reforms the Federal Election Commission, the nation's election watchdog.
Americans deserve a Congress that approaches its work in innovative new ways. I’m honored to have been chosen to lead the committee tasked with coming up with the ways to modernize Congress and get it working for the people again. I can't wait to
This committee represents an important step forward in renovating the House.  Americans deserve a Congress where they have a say and things get done.  They deserve a Congress that uses cutting-edge technology and that is as diverse as our nation. 2/3
It has been clear for a long time that the House is a fixer-upper. Every time bills are written behind closed doors or passed without debate, every time Americans feel like they don’t have a say and too little is getting done, people lose faith. Congress needs to do better. 1/3

The @seattletimes is right: Veterans deserve better. It is unacceptable that veterans aren't receiving the GI Bill benefits they've earned. The VA must pay #veterans what they're owed, the government must fix the breakdowns that led to this problem.
Happy New Year!!
Federal workers in our region maintain Navy ships, care for veterans, deliver the mail, welcome visitors at the national park, prep timber sales and do other critical jobs. Cancelling cost of living increases is wrong for them - and for our local economy. 
Federal workers aren’t Democrats or Republicans when they’re at work. They are public servants that prep timber sales in federal forests, welcome visitors to national parks, ensure citizens can get the services they need, and keep us safe. They are not pawns in a game.

My thoughts on the news regarding Secretary Mattis:
The president said he’d be “proud” to #shutdown the government. I couldn’t disagree more. I hope the President comes to his senses and embraces a bipartisan path that keeps the government open.
Every American should read the @USCCRgov 's Broken Promises report and then demand federal investments that live up to America's trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans. The country must not waste another decade of inaction. I'll push Congress to deliver.
