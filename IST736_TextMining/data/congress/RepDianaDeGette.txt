ICYMI - We passed a sweeping new elections reform bill yesterday to make it easier for people to vote and stop the flood of unlimited dark money that’s corrupting our democracy. Now, we need the Senate to step up and do the same. #HR1
Unbelievable. The Trump administration is planning to take $385 million away from various health programs – incl. cancer and Alzheimer’s research – to spend it on housing undocumented children trying to cross the border. That’s outrageous! We should be doing exactly the opposite.
BIG WIN: A judge just ruled the Trump administration must enact an Obama-era rule meant to ensure minority students are provided the same access to education as all other children in this country. This is something I’ve been working on for a while, and will continue to fight for.
I just took to the House floor to urge all my colleagues to get in this fight and help us pass #HR1 to end the flood of unlimited, undisclosed money that’s corrupting our democracy. This is, without a doubt, one of the most important issues we will take on this year.

The fight to #SaveTheInternet is officially back on! Our Energy and Commerce committee is already hard at work on legislation to restore the #NetNeutrality rules that the FCC took away. We'll be holding a hearing on this important bill, which I’m a proud sponsor of, next week.
We should be working to make it easier, not harder, for people to vote. That’s what #HR1 would do. It would make it easier to register, easier to cast your ballot and easier to count your vote. It would also help restore the Voting Rights Act protections that were stripped away.
This is BIG: The American Medical Association just joined @PPFA in suing to block President Trump’s Title X Gag Rule. AMA says withholding information about abortions, or any other healthcare-related options, from patients goes against its Code of Medical Ethics. #NoGagRule
This week we are going to be bringing an ambitious set of democratic reforms to the House floor for a vote. It’s known as #HR1 and the goal is simple: return power to the people, restore faith in our democracy and end the #CultureOfCorruption.

Great spending time with these 4th grade students at Denver’s Escuela de Guadalupe today to talk about the importance of preserving our national parks. I told them how I'm fighting to let all 4th graders visit our public lands for free. They told me "how awesome that would be."
Glad to see steps are being taken by some to reduce the cost of insulin, but we still have a long way to go to make it truly affordable for all. The fact that insulin has gone from $20/vial in 1996 to $275/vial today is unfathomable – and we are going to continue to investigate.
Teens’ use of e-cigs is skyrocketing in the U.S. Experts say kid-friendly flavors of nicotine (i.e. Gummy Bear Cotton Candy) are causing this spike. To better protect our kids, I am filing a bill to ban the sale of these e-cig flavors:

If President Trump thought he was going to be able issue a domestic gag rule in this country without a fight, he’s gravely mistaken. Here’s the letter we just sent to HHS challenging the legality of this shameful rule:
How do we stop this current outbreak of measles in the U.S.? That’s what our committee is investigating, and that was the topic of our hearing yesterday in which we had both the CDC and NIH in to answer some very important questions.
For the first time in decades, the House just voted to pass a commonsense gun safety measure. So proud of all my colleagues who stood with us to pass this bill requiring a background check on all gun sales. This never would have happened if GOP still in control. #EnoughIsEnough
Proud to join my colleagues as a cosponsor of the #MedicareForAll bill introduced today. We must find ways to make healthcare more affordable and more accessible for all Americans.
159 people in 10 states have now been infected with measles. This highly-contagious disease was virtually eliminated in the U.S. At 10am EST, our Oversight panel will be asking the CDC how this happened and what’s being done to stop the spread. Watch here:
President Trump used the power of his office to declare a fake national emergency. We just used ours to terminate it. The president needs to understand that we are not going to sit back and allow him to tear up the Constitution, ignore the will of the people and do as he pleases.
Great meeting with @ColoradoSALC today to discuss issues affecting our nation’s mail service. @USPS is a critical American institution and must remain healthy and vibrant for decades to come!

Let’s be clear, Mr. President: There is no such thing as abortion AFTER birth. And we already have several laws that prevent the killing of newborn infants. Doctors across the country opposed this bill. It sought to solve a problem that doesn’t exist. That’s why it failed.
We have seen a significant drop in the EPA’s enforcement of our nation’s environmental laws under the Trump administration. That’s unacceptable and we’re not going to allow it to continue. Watch here at 10:30 a.m. ET as we demand answers from the EPA:
The Trump administration just finalized a new rule to cut off federal funding to any group that provides abortion services. It’s a direct attack on women’s reproductive rights. We are going to do everything we can to stop it. #NoGagRule

16 states, including CO, have now joined forces in a lawsuit to block Trump’s fake emergency and prevent him from spending billions of dollars on an unnecessary wall. Proud that @GovofCO and @COAttnyGeneral are doing their part to help us stop this abuse of power.
The president’s decision today, to declare a fake national emergency just so he can take money away from other important projects and spend it on his wall, is beyond the pale – and, I believe, an abuse of power. #FakeTrumpEmergency
One year ago today we all watched the horrific images coming out of Parkland, FL. Such a tragedy never should have happened – not in Parkland, not in Columbine, not in Aurora, not in Newtown, not anywhere. Congress must act. We need to get these assault weapons off our streets.
Great to meet with @lockheedmartin employees and the many local Colorado suppliers who are building the @NASA_Orion spacecraft that will carry our American astronauts to the moon, mars and beyond!
The FDA has recalled at least 15 drugs used to treat high blood pressure because they contained known carcinogens. The drugs were all made in either China or India. Today, I’m demanding answers. Here’s the letter I just sent to the head of the FDA:
I just introduced a bill to make permanent a program that lets 4th grade kids and their families visit our national parks for free. Children are our future and this bill will ensure every kid has an opportunity to experience all the beauty and wonder that our parks have to offer.
Another hearing, another panel, another unanimous verdict!  At this morning’s panel on public lands, I asked every witness there one simple question: Is climate change real and is it something we need to urgently address? Every one of them answered, “yes!”
There is no legitimate reason for anyone, other than law enforcement, to need a semi-automatic assault rifle with a high-capacity magazine. Today, @RepTedDeutch and I introduced legislation to ban high-capacity magazines that hold more than ten rounds. #EnoughIsEnough
The FDA approved a new drug, Dsuvia, that’s 10x more powerful than fentanyl and 1,000x more powerful than morphine. So, as we try to combat our nation’s opioid epidemic, the FDA is approving new drugs that will make it worse? We want to know why:

Pleased about the court's ruling on this important case. But it also serves as a reminder that our fight against draconian restrictions on abortion rights is still far from over – and why it's so important that we stay united in our efforts to protect reproductive rights.
John Dingell was a towering figure in Congress. He was a master legislator, known for his tireless preparation, good humor and dedication to public service and oversight. I was lucky to call John Dingell my mentor, and even luckier to call him my friend. He'll be forever missed.

Last night, Trump said he wants Congress to stop its "ridiculous" investigations of his administration. Sorry, Mr. President, as chair of the Oversight panel I can tell you: We're just getting started. Our first hearing is tomorrow on your shameful child-separation policy.
Here’s my full statement on the president’s speech:
If Trump wants to work with us to find real solutions to our nation’s most pressing issues, then we are ready to work with him. But if he’s going to continue to deny climate change, roll back environmental regs and eliminate the ACA, then he’s going to have a fight on his hands
What we heard tonight was classic state-of-the-union Trump, who tells everybody what they want to hear. Unfortunately, what we are forced to live with every other day is a president whose actions are doing real harm to our country.

Yesterday, I met with this amazing group of women Muslim leaders who, despite facing discrimination, are continuing to pursue the American dream. They are inspiring, and we had a good discussion about why we must stop the president’s #travelban.
Tomorrow, two House committees – the Natural Resources Committee and @EnergyCommerce – are holding the first Congressional hearings on Climate Change since Trump took office. These hearings will end years of GOP neglect denial on the issue, and I will be participating in both.
During #BlackHistoryMonth , I'll be sharing facts about Colorado's black history, which has played a pivotal role in shaping our state and the western values we hold dear. There's so much to remember and celebrate this month and year round.

Just wrote to the head of the @DeptofDefense urging him not to implement #Trump's proposed ban on #transgender servicemembers, despite the Court’s decision to allow implementation. This baseless policy won't make our country safer, it’s just more bigotry.
There were more than 26 billion robocalls placed in the U.S. last year – up 46% from the year before! We have to do more to stop these unwanted calls. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor legislation today to give @FCC the power it needs to crack down on these annoying calls.
Jonathan White, who wrote this recent report on behalf of the administration, will be appearing before my committee next week. I would suggest he come prepared to answer some very direct questions.
These aren’t just numbers on a page, or names on a list - these are real kids, with real families, who are scared to death.
The fact that the Trump administration hasn’t even ‘tried to determine the total number of children separated from a parent or guardian by immigration authorities’ is inexcusable.
Check out my e-newsletter recapping some of this week's important developments, including my work on @EnergyCommerce to get more information about the President's #FamilySeparation policy and the rising cost of #insulin.
Today, we kick off #BlackHistoryMonth. While the legacy of African Americans in Colorado and across America should be celebrated year-round, I hope you’ll especially join us this month to take time to reflect on some of the most significant contributions made through our history.
I met yesterday with community leaders to discuss proposed changes to the so-called public charge rule. If approved, these changes would prevent many immigrants from getting the public assistance they need – and that’s why I sent a letter to @DHSgov opposing these changes.
I had a great discussion with a group of #climatechange activists in our community on Thursday. As chair of the @EnergyCommerce oversight panel, shining a light on the #Trump administration's failure to properly tackle climate change is one of my top priorities.
Our first oversight hearing on President Trump’s shameful family separation policy will be next Thursday, Feb. 7. Despite the public outrage, the previous Republican majority did nothing to hold the administration accountable. That ends next week.
I'm honored to carry on the dedicated work of women leaders who came before me in getting this amendment ratified. We still need the #ERANow.
Both offer new opportunities to protect women from unfair and unjust discrimination. Though we've made strides, we still need an amendment to enshrine the rights we deserve.
That's why I have signed on to two resolutions -- one that would repeal the expired deadline for the original ERA, and another that creates a modified version of the ERA that explicitly guarantees equal rights for men and women.
The push to ratify the #EqualRightsAmendment (ERA) was a bold effort to expand women's rights across America. But sadly, it wasn't ratified in time by enough states to become law of the land. 37 years after it missed the mark, its protections are still needed.
Great meeting w/ @nfbco members, as well as these two amazing students, Deyannira Villa Cazares of Denver and Ian Lee of Aurora, who are on Capitol Hill today to help increase access to technology for the visually impaired, which is a critical goal for so many fellow Coloradans.
I’m proud to stand with @HouseDemocrats today as a sponsor of the #PaycheckFairnessAct to ensure men and women receive equal pay for equal work. Progress in achieving this goal is still too slow, and we need to take bold action by passing this bill.
We just sent letters to drug makers Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Sanofi, demanding to know why the price of insulin continues to skyrocket. This is a lifesaving drug that millions of Americans rely on – we can’t let its cost put it out of reach.  
It’s been 10 years since Pres. Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. It was a monumental step towards ensuring equal pay, but we still have a lot of work to do. I’m proud to continue to be working to close this unacceptable pay gap once and for all.
#Trump's @EPA is trying to roll back our nation’s air quality standards to help big corporations make more money, while putting our health at risk. That’s not right. And that's why I am working with my @EnergyCommerce colleagues to hold them accountable.
Just sent a letter to the head of @EPA demanding info about the Trump administration’s plan to roll back air-quality standards. We’re not going to sit back and let this administration put Americans’ health at risk just so companies can make more money.

Americans are hurting, Mr. President. Enough is enough. We need to end the shutdown now. Then, work with Congress to find real solutions to enhance our border security. Coloradans, and all Americans, deserve leadership - not a tantrum.
I support enhancing our border security, but we need to have a real conversation about it instead of this “my way or the highway” approach President Trump is stuck on.
The House has voted multiple times to reopen the government, but President #Trump and Senate Republicans refuse to end this shutdown. They are holding our government and economy hostage for a ridiculous wall. The American people deserve better. We need to end the #shutdown now.
This is a devastating blow in the fight for #equality. I've been working to oppose this unjust policy from the beginning, and, despite this setback, we won't quit now. This is about legitimizing #trans Americans' inherent value -- in our military and our society at large.

First and foremost, he needs to end this shutdown immediately and then work with Congress on smart and effective border security methods that work.
The president’s address shows he continues to have no problem using people’s lives and livelihoods as a bargaining chip for his dangerous agenda.

Today, one year later, I presided over the House floor and there wasn’t one anti-choice bill in sight. Elections have consequences!
This time last year, I was fighting hard against a draconian, anti-choice bill House Republicans were pushing ahead of the March for Life. For at least the last 5 years, House Republicans voted on these types of bills ahead of the march.
I'm proud to cosponsor the #RaiseTheWage Act, which increases the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024. As the ultra-rich get richer, working families have an increasingly tough time making ends meet; that's not right. it's time we ensure a livable wage for every American worker.

If #Trump doesn't end his #shutdown soon, millions of needy families could see drastic cuts to their food assistance benefits. I just sent a letter to @SecretarySonny demanding to know what the @USDA can do to continue helping these families in need.
More than 15,000 federal employees in our state are either working without pay or furloughed due to the #TrumpShutdown. Many will be watching the President's speech tonight, and they deserve to know why he thinks a wall is more important than their livelihoods.
This #TrumpShutdown is hurting more than just federal workers – it’s affecting our entire economy. New report shows every day #Trump keeps the government closed, America’s small businesses are paying the price. That’s not right. #EndTheShutdown today!
Easy to say for a man who’s notorious for not paying people what he owes. No wonder he has little sympathy for working families who play by the rules. End this #TrumpShutdown!
Today marks the first full pay period missed by Federal employees affected by the #TrumpShutdown. That means missing prescription refills, grocery trips, child care, rent and more. Meanwhile, senior #Trump officials are getting a pay bump. Is this his idea of draining the swamp?
@PeteDominick @ProChoiceCaucus @RepBarbaraLee @SIRIUSXM Thanks for the kind words. I’d love to chat soon.

This morning, House Democratic women gathered for a photo to mark the beginning of the 116th Congress. I'm thrilled to work with these smart, passionate and principled sisters of mine to improve America for all. We have a lot to accomplish, but women know how to get the job done.
800k civil servants are either furloughed or working without pay during the #shutdown that #Trump engineered over his pointless border wall. Now, his cronies are about to cash in? This is outrageous hypocrisy. He must end this stunt and reopen our gov't.
I'm honored to cosponsor #HR1, The For the People Act of 2019, which institutes much-needed reforms to curb the toxic influence of big-moneyed special interests in our politics. Our Democracy succeeds when each voice matters more than any dollar. #ForThePeople

Congrats to @JoeNeguse, spotted here on the House floor, and @JasonCrowCO6 on becoming Colorado's newest members of Congress! I'm looking forward to working with them to improve our state and our nation.
One of the biggest priorities of the 116th Congress will be stopping #Trump's relentless attacks on women's health. As @ProChoiceCaucus Co-Chairs, @RepBarbaraLee and I are prepared and excited to continue leading that charge. We must protect and expand #ReproRights.
Here's to a better future for our kids. They're counting on us to fight #ClimateChange, improve our education system, expand civil rights for all, and much more. #ForThePeople
Congratulations to our new Speaker of the House, @SpeakerPelosi! With her steady leadership, I'm confident @HouseDemocrats can deliver wins for the American people and provide a much-needed check on @realDonaldTrump and his administration. Let's get to work #ForThePeople!
Today is historic. A record number of women -- 102 in all -- will be sworn into the House of Reps. When I first came to Washington in 1997, there were less than 60 of us. For my colleagues and I, this growth is heartening but a long time coming. Let's keep up the momentum!
It was a pleasure meeting @PPFA's new President, @DrLeanaWen, to discuss our shared goal of strengthening women's health. As the co-chair of the @ProChoiceCaucus, I'm honored to have her as partner in the ongoing effort to defend our #reprorights in the new Congress and beyond.
So @POTUS, since you’re taking responsibility for this #shutdown, what do you have to say to the 800,000 federal employees who aren’t being paid during the holidays? @AFGENational
As we get closer and closer to a #TrumpShutdown, don’t forget who is responsible for it — and who has the power to prevent it before Americans are harmed.
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including working to prevent a disastrous #TrumpShutdown this holiday season, streamline the over-the-counter drug approval process, #CutMethane and encourage Coloradans to #GetCovered.
As #Trump hurls America toward a government #shutdown, we can at least be grateful that, for now, #SCOTUS has blocked his scheme to shut down our border to those in need. I'll keep working to prevent both.
It's shameful that #Trump is willing to shut down the gov't and furlough more than 800K employees during the holidays just to get his senseless and xenophobic border wall -- which I totally oppose. He must work with Dems to keep the gov't open and secure our borders efficiently.
Wishing Justice Ginsburg a speedy and easy recovery. I hope to see you back on the bench soon where your wisdom, intellect and commitment to the rule of law are needed now more than ever.

Pleased the House overwhelmingly passed my bipartisan bill, H.R.7328, that streamlines how @US_FDA approves over-the-counter drugs. The antiquated framework now in place stalls innovation and harms public health. Today I spoke in favor of this update, which protect consumers.
When I chair the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee next year, we will strengthen our ongoing efforts to seek answers regarding this scandal and create safeguards to protect children, and everyone else, from this grave harm.
While the horrific crimes of Larry Nassar against our Olympic athletes have captured the headlines, they are just one example of unchecked sexual abuse occurring in organized sports and countless other fields.
This is extremely troubling. Even after my @HouseCommerce colleagues and I grilled Mark Zuckerberg over privacy standards earlier this year, it seems @facebook is still unwilling to be transparent about its use of personal data. We need a further investigation -- and the truth.
I led my colleagues in sending a letter to @EPAAWheeler strongly condemning @EPA's proposed rule to weaken standards that curb #methane emissions. In the fight against #ClimateChange, we must #CutMethane, and we can't afford this dangerous rollback.
Don’t let a lower court case in Texas confuse you or your loved ones—you can still get the health coverage you need. If you sign up today, you can still get health insurance coverage that starts on Jan. 1, 2019. Get covered at
The Texas court ruling on the #ACA once again shows that Republicans will stop at nothing to destroy this law and rip away the health coverage it has provided for millions of Americans. We will use all tools at our disposal to make sure this decision does not stand.
It's not only sad, @SecNielsen, it's an outrage. Let's be clear -- this young girl's tragic death is the direct result of America's draconian policies at the border that put more people in these dangerous situations. Platitudes and condolences aren't enough. We need change.
In this week's e-newsletter, I recap the latest, including passing my #MaternalMortality legislation, working to lower #insulin costs, opposing #Trump's proposed changes to the #PublicCharge rule, celebrating two years of 21st Century Cures, and more.
My colleagues and I sent a letter to #Trump demanding he heed the warnings presented in the National Climate Assessment and commit to stopping #ClimateChange. Our nation has a moral responsibility to lead the world in this effort, and we won't tolerate inaction.
Important #OpenEnrollment deadline: Tomorrow, December 15, is the last day to sign up for a health plan that begins on January 1. Don't miss your chance to start the year off with quality and affordable coverage. Visit to easily shop for plans. #GetCovered

It's unthinkable that six years after this tragedy, and the many mass shootings that have occurred since, America is still paralyzed by inaction. In the new Congress, we must make passing gun safety legislation a top priority. No more senseless deaths. No more excuses.
Thrilled that my Senate colleagues have swiftly passed our bipartisan legislation — just two days after being unanimously approved by the House. This is a significant step in reducing America’s maternal mortality rate, which ensures more happy and healthy families. ����
Here’s my statement on @HouseGOP's shameless and embarrassing hearing today that sought to discredit life-saving fetal tissue research. We won't put up with these anti-choice sideshows in the next Congress. Sound science must lead the way.
Two years after 21st Century Cures was signed into law, I am amazed by the progress it has made in fighting diseases and improving public health. This bipartisan effort is saving lives, and we must work toward similar reforms in the new Congress.
Tomorrow marks one year since @FCC repealed #NetNeutrality. Over the past year, millions of Americans have voiced their support for restoring #NetNeutrality rules, and I'll continue fighting for the free and open internet.
If true, this inexplicably heartless decision will endanger Vietnamese refugees who have lived in this country for decades and built new lives. I expressed my strong opposition to this proposal in a Sept. 2018 letter to @SecNielsen and will continue working to prevent this.
In the three years since the #ParisAgreement was adopted, #Trump has sold America's leadership on fighting #ClimateChange to the highest bidder, pulling us out of the initiative and gutting environmental safeguards. Still, we'll keep fighting for a cleaner future. #ActOnClimate
Today, @HouseCommerce held a hearing on access to SAFE kits, which help survivors of rape and sexual assault get the care they need preserve evidence for law enforcement. We need to ensure more people receive these exams, we must renew #VAWA, which can help achieve this goal.
My @ProChoiceCaucus Co-Chair, @RepBarbaraLee, and I are proud to author this letter opposing #Trump's cruel changes to the #PublicCharge rule that could rip away reproductive health care from many. This a right we must defend for every woman -- regardless of immigration status.
.@HouseGOP needs to follow the Constitution, which clearly grants Congress the power to authorize military force. Instead, they are seeking to block @RepRoKhanna's resolution I've cosponsored that ends our unauthorized support for the war in Yemen. They should be ashamed.
RT @RepJoeKennedy: A crisis of maternal mortality —particularly one entrenched and exacerbated along racial lines — is unacceptable in the…
By helping to bring biosimilar #insulin to market, @US_FDA has taken a huge step to achieve relief for people with #diabetes. Through my investigation into rising #insulin costs, I called for this action and commend @SGottliebFDA for his follow through.
Westerners understand the importance of access to clean water. That’s why I’ve consistently opposed efforts to limit Clean Water Act protections. This move will harm ecosystems, communities, and our economy, and I'll work to hold @EPA accountable for it.
Today the House unanimously passed H.R. 1318, my bipartisan bill with @HerreraBeutler that tackles the troubling rise of maternal mortality in the United States. Thanks to my House colleagues for recognizing the need for action on this public health crisis. Let's make it law.
I joined my fellow congressional Democrats from Colorado in sending a letter to @DHSgov opposing proposed changes to the #PublicCharge rule. If adopted, it would shut the door to the American dream for families across Colorado and around the world.
RT @RepDianaDeGette: The #ACA has helped ensure the right to health care for millions of Americans. This #OpenEnrollment season, you and yo…
This is tragic. Not long ago, the U.S. was a global leader in the fight against #ClimateChange. Now, we are joining Russia and Saudi Arabia and opposing the rest of the world in understanding the urgent threats we face.
Pleased that the Supreme Court is declining to hear this case, which is part of the ongoing assault on women, low-income Americans and the health care provider that is often their only lifeline, @PPFA. We must end this dangerous witch hunt.
A big thank you to members of @sunrisemvmt for stopping by my DC office this morning. They talked with my staff about the best ways to #ActOnClimate in the new Congress and beyond. I'm proud to have them as partners in tackling this moral imperative of our time.
Proud to unveil bipartisan draft legislation that helps improve the way @FDA approves and regulates diagnostic tests. As we modernize ways to fight diseases, we need a new regulatory framework to match improvements in diagnostics medicine. Read more:
#Trump's @EPA is undermining its goal of environmental stewardship not only through its actions, but also through troubling inaction on a number of its responsibilities. Lack of oversight from @HouseGOP allowed this agency to steer far from its mission, but now the party's over.
Meanwhile, #Trump takes us even further from this objective in his quest to protect polluters and erase @POTUS44's efforts to fight #ClimateChange. This #coal proposal is the latest in a long list of actions that harm our environment and our communities.
Coloradans have spoken loud and clear: #NetNeutrality must be restored to ensure an equal playing field online. We must keep pushing for 218 signatures on the discharge petition to force a vote in the House on reinstating these protections by the end of the year!
This terrifying chart reveals an even scarier truth -- we're moving in the wrong direction in the fight to stop the devastating effects of #ClimateChange. As global citizens, we must reduce carbon emissions together or collectively suffer the consequences.
Congratulations to Denver native, @I_CU_Boy, on this well-deserved distinction! From one @denversouthhigh alum to another — thanks for making our community proud and contributing to the ongoing legacy of the @Broncos. Keep up the good work!
