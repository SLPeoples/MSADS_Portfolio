We cannot forget that the Taliban who are still allied with al Qaida and ISIS continue to kill innocents by the thousands. Further, it is a mistake to negotiate with the Taliban without the presence of the Afghanistan government.
This shows our commitment to the defense of Israel. Rapid deployment of advanced missile def. will help deter Iran assure our allies in the region. A decade ago, I helped establish our missile def. partnership w/ Israel am glad to see this next step.
Despite letter from 16 House Dems in opposition, there is strong bipartisan support to pressure Maduro to step down. He’s totally devastated Venezuela w/ his socialist and totalitarian policies. He must go.

ICYMI: Here is last week's Bacon Bytes where I discuss my vote on the Emergency Declaration and a pressing issue with Army modernization that we discussed at the Armed Services Committee Hearing last week.
As someone sworn to uphold the Constitution of the United States, I voted no on H.R. 1 - an attempt to thwart the constitutional rights of states in regulating elections, silence Americans’ free speech, and violates separation of powers. My release here:

I wholeheartedly agree with our great Senator, @SenatorFischer . A modernized TRIAD gives us confidence in our deterrence and safety from nuclear war.
I’m grateful for your kind comments, especially about our young staff who give their best everyday.
@TomRasmussen19 I appreciate some of our House Democratic colleagues who are speaking up and who agree with my statement.
@vince_powers You must not read OWH or seen my previous posts?
@McSushiSosumi @JosiahShanks The ACLU has HR1 in check!
@kohenari @CDRutledge I agree.
I am pleased that Nancy Pelosi is bringing the Resolution to the floor and I intend to vote in favor of the Resolution. This should have bipartisan support.
@ConnecticutRed @davesund It will bring even more money into our elections... not good.

@kohenari And... I believe we should protect the First Amendment, this one great reason to vote no as I said yesterday on the floor. There are good parts to the bill... but terrible parts too. I’d be glad to support smaller portions of the bill if given opportunity.
@JosiahShanks @davesund But... they recommend voting “no” on the bill and for good reason. There are good parts to the bill, but it also contains aspects that are bad for our country.
@davesund One big reason, government funding of Congressional campaigns.
@JosiahShanks Yet they oppose the bill.
@ScottBlake @CommiKara @karaforcongress @CommieKara @KaraMarxEastman @fakeGovRicketts @FauxBeauMcCoy @FauxPelini @NoErnieChambers @FauxWH There’s one with me having a beautiful looking mustache.
@kohenari This bill is so bad even the ACLU opposes it. I won’t support federal funding of Congressional campaigns. There are some individual aspects that are good and we should vote on those separately.

Our nuclear deterrent is old and only getting older. I fully support nuclear modernization for each leg of the triad as it is critical to sustain an effective nuclear deterrent. Today at our @HASCRepublicans hearing I stressed the importance of this. You can watch the video here:
Even the ACLU does not support #HR1. And when the ACLU doesn't support a Democratic election bill, you know it's WRONG. #NOTforthePeopleAct
I spoke in opposition to the #NOTforthePeopleAct which is nothing less than an attempt by Dem leadership to federalize our election system, strip all authority from states, give American’s hard-earned $ into the campaigns of politicians. My speech here:
@bfoxthinks @JBWolfsthal @emmaclairefoley I appreciate civil dialogue with all. I’ll pass on the incivility and vitriol.
@JBWolfsthal I value the dialogue. An important topic such as this deserves vetting... and a debate on no first use policy, low yield nuclear weapons, TRIAD modernization, etc. merit knowing the pros and cons thoroughly. Don
@JBWolfsthal @emmaclairefoley I know..  Mattis was their boss. And General Hyten has made clear his strong support for a modernized TRIAD.
@JBWolfsthal @emmaclairefoley We’ve had occurrences where our subs were found and vulnerable... and learned after the fact. We can’t afford that when it comes to deterrence. We need all three to safeguard our country from nuclear war.
@JBWolfsthal @emmaclairefoley I believe your proposals add risk and increase odds for miscalculation. The TRIAD has served us well. I’ll continue to advocate for a strong and modernized TRIAD.
@JBWolfsthal @emmaclairefoley Not according to the ones I’ve talked to. Gen Mattis said otherwise.
@emmaclairefoley My intent is to ensure we have a survivable second strike capability. The proposal to go down to five submarines and 49 bombers doesn’t do that. I don’t want to barely have enough deterrence... we want an overwhelming deterrence capability to prevent Russian miscalculation.
@goingretzro Yes. There. Is.  Over 70,000 individuals crossing illegally this last month alone. That amounts to over 800,000 annually if this rate continues.  We cannot sustain this nor should we.
@emmaclairefoley Do you barely want deterrence? I want a clear second strike capability so that deterrence is maintained.
Thank you for your great advocacy. I stand with you in this fight against #T1D.
This is another reason why we must take action now. Gridlock is leaving our southern border vulnerable and our Border Patrol are telling us they are swamped. Congress should have been able to come together and deal with this emergency.

@JosiahShanks I said in one of the debates and in OWH who I was voting for.
The Far Left running the House aren’t interested in finding areas of consensus working w/ the Senate POTUS. If we want solutions on imm, prescription drugs, etc, the moderate wing will need a larger voice, not one silenced by threats of primary defeats. 
Well said @RepDougCollins. I support this effort, and am an original cosponsor of this crucial legislation.
The price tag of the Green New Deal is more than quadruple our current national debt. This would be disastrous for our country.
In 2018, the U.S. economy grew at the highest rate in 13 years!
