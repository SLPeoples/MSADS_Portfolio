Reminder: as Republicans hold press conferences to eat hamburgers and hold show votes, they also embrace policies that will make climate change worse.The Trump Administration has been a disaster for climate policy.
In early 2009 House Republicans reacted to the election of the man I worked for and served under, President Barack Obama, with birther legislation.The all-GOP cosponsor list included committee chairs, Appropriations cardinals, and a future US Senator.

Confronted with the horrifying details of their family separation policy, Trump Administration officials today argued that the cages they put children into were not cages. As if that makes it any better.These abuses happened because there was no oversight. We need MORE of it.
