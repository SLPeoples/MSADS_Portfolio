New Jersey's Tenth Congressional District had much to celebrate last year. A few weeks ago, I sent out an update to our district. Check out the Payne, Jr. Journal online at this link:
Today, the House of Representatives passed #HR1, a sweeping bill #ForThePeople. Democracy should work for everyone.
We have to break the taboo about colorectal cancer screening in the United States. And we have to remove barriers to screening. On the anniversary of the death of my father, I introduced a bipartisan bill and bipartisan resolution to help save lives.
This is what representation looks like. #InternationalWomensDay
#IWD2019 reminds us of a value that we must keep every day: Everyone is created equal. We can have no progress unless women are represented in every discussion, ever decision, and every leadership meeting.
The passage of #HR1 is a milestone for ensuring that the vote is open to all Americans.
After Sandy Hook, #Republicans did nothing. After #Parkland, nothing. My #GOP colleagues last year sat back and did nothing while the Trump administration held children in cages. Ineptitude. Cowardice. Yesterday, I spoke out:
I just met with Ambassador Fezas Vital of Portugal to discuss our countries' long history as allies and the future of our relationship. We share many common interests that are important to both nations.
I was on the House Floor today to remind my colleagues that the House was called into order on behalf of all children. The Parkland students catalyzed an intersectional movement that is bringing change to Congress. #MSDStrong #NeverAgain #EndGunViolence
Democrats are fighting for America's children—all of them. We are fighting back against the #NRA, and we are fighting to end the @realDonaldTrump administration's abuse of children at the border. I was on the House Floor today to speak up and speak out.
Last year was horrendous for children in our country. If we look at #gunviolence or #immigration or health care or poverty relief, children suffered last year under the Trump administration and a Republican Congress. Democrats are working #ForthePeople, and that means all people.
.@Michael31Thomas from my team, the @nygiants, is interning on Capitol Hill with @j_bademosi24 of the Texans. It was great to meet with them at an event honoring the history of the Green Book.
Thanks to Exxon CEO Darren Woods for coming to the Capitol and honoring the traveling exhibit highlighting the Green Book.
The history of the Green Book is a history of Black America. Just before lunch, I had the privilege of joining my colleagues to honor a new traveling exhibition on the Green Book.
Speaking of standing up for America’s children, the Trump administration has been terrible for children and families, including those at the border. Children have been held in cages. They have died because of the administration’s horrendous immigration policy.
The 116th Congress was called to action #ForThePeople and for all of America’s children. The Majority will not bow down to the #NRA. We will continue to fight for children and for common-sense gun reform. #NeverAgain #MSDStrong
This morning, I am meeting with the United Mine Workers to discuss America's labor force and miners' pensions. Workers are the backbone of America's economy. Meeting with people who are on the ground doing the work that drives our nation is always a productive experience.
Yesterday was the seventh anniversary of the death of my father, the  great Congressman Donald M. Payne. In his honor, I introduced a bipartisan resolution to declare March 2019 National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. Education about the preventable #cancer can save lives.
I'm joined by a bipartisan group of more than 100 Members of Congress, led by @RodneyDavis, @RepMcEachin, and @RepMcKinley. Colorectal cancer screening saves lives. For more on the bill and links to its text, visit 2/2
Today, I introduced the Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act, to reduce costs for Medicare recipients whose colonoscopies result in polyp removal. 1/
Earlier this year, a wonderful new community group formed in my district. The Multiple Sclerosis Support Group of Hudson County aims to bring people together to help support, encourage, and uplift those who are affected by MS. Good people do great things.
Two children have died in @CBP custody in recent months. I’m at a Homeland Security Committee hearing to push back against the @realDonaldTrump administration’s inhumane policy.   #NielsenHearing
Seven years ago, the world lost a great leader. My father, Congressman Donald M. Payne, Sr., fought for human rights at home and abroad. He believed in people's potential to make the world a better place. His legacy lives on through the lives he touched, mine included.
I met with local elected officials in town with the National Association of Counties to discuss the importance of investing in America's #transportation and #infrastructure. Local officials are on the frontlines and need the federal government to be a good partner for growth.
The safety of our nation's air traffic and airspace should not be compromised during a government shutdown. That's one reason I'm cosponsoring HR 1108, the Aviation Funding Stability Act of 2019.
Shoutout to my new colleagues @RepAOC, @RepPressley, and @RepRashida who were at the top of their game during oversight hearings this week. History is being written in the halls of Congress and streets of our nation every day.
There can be no progress without women (plural) at the table. #WomensHistoryMonth
America's health and wellness coaches are important players in health care. They help people manage chronic conditions. They are there to help people set their health goals and to help people achieve those goals.
#HR8 passed the House! The @NRA no longer has a stranglehold on the federal government. The years of No Republican Action in the House on #gunviolence are over. The Senate and President should do the right thing and make universal background checks law.
Nearly 40,000 Americans lose their lives each year because of gun violence. Enough is enough. I am proud to vote today for #HR8, a bipartisan bill to keep our communities safe from gun violence by expanding universal background checks. #EndGunViolence
More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks. That’s why I am voting today to support #HR8, a bipartisan bill to #EndGunViolence and expand background checks.
.@realDonaldTrump is trying to fundamentally alter the separation of powers between the branches of our government as set out in the Constitution. This goes beyond party – my @HouseGOP colleagues must stand up against this #FakeEmergency!
Samuel D. Roberts is a pioneer public servant in New York. His lifetime of service to his community and state has helped generations of people. As he embarks on a new role at SUNY Oswego, I wish him continued success as a leader and advocate.
Today, the American Association of Blacks in Energy visited my office. We engaged in conversations about the LIHEAP Program and how small businesses are economic engines for community development.
Yesterday, I was on the House Floor to honor #BlackHistory and the Black medical professionals whose lives continue to shape our nation. As Black History Month comes to a close, let's not lose sight of the fact that our stories are all connected.
This afternoon, I had a productive discussion with the Jewish Federation of Greater MetroWest Leadership Division. We talked about disability rights, the tragic shooting at Pittsburgh, and the needs of Jewish Americans across the country.
Thanks to the City of Linden for honoring my father’s legacy this Black History Month. Congressman Donald Payne, Sr. was a champion for human rights, both at home and abroad.
Families are still being torn apart because of the Trump admin’s cruel anti-immigrant agenda. No family should have to endure this cruelty. #EndFamilySeparation 
First thing today, I met disabled veterans from across New Jersey who are in D.C. to advocate for veterans’ services. Sacrifices made by people in uniform are vital to our nation’s health. Let’s make sure their health is protected for life. Thank you for your service.
Jennifer Wiggins was the only person to cut my hair from 1984 to 2012, when I came to Congress. Since then, I've only had three other haircuts. She's an institution, and she is retiring. A whole community is going to miss her!
Yesterday, I was in Hillside to celebrate Black History Month and Black futures. Thanks to Mayor Dahlia Vertreese and congratulations to the honorees. Our history is still being written, and folks in Hillside are doing the writing.
Rev. Barry R. Miller is celebrating his one-year anniversary leading Abyssinian Baptist Church. It was a delight to join my community to celebrate leadership and progress.
Today was Selfie Sunday! I had a blast with the Union County Black Leadership Caucus to celebrate Black History Month. Better yet, we celebrated Black futures and the common causes for which we all fight. Thanks to everyone for such a great event!
Thanks to Kate O'Brien a TB survivor and patient advocate for coming by my Newark office with Dona Miller, a public health representative at the Global Tuberculosis Institute. We had a very a productive exchange of information about minimizing outbreaks of Tuberculosis.
Today, I joined more than more than 225 Members of Congress to cosponsor a resolution to terminate President Trump’s unlawful, dangerous emergency declaration that would steal $51,200,000 of urgently needed military construction funds for NJ. My statement:
I had a great meeting with Mayor Dahlia Vertreese of Hillside and Steve Augustin on Tuesday. We discussed the great work Mayor Vertreese has done to foster economic development in Hillside, as well as the ways Congress can help to build local economies.
Today, I joined Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver, Beth Israel Medical Center, and Children's Hospital to celebrate Black History Month. Some of the greatest contributions to medicine have been made by Black people and African Americans. Thanks to everyone making Black history daily.
On this day 63 years ago, nearly 100 Americans were arrested for standing up for their rights and refusing to ride a segregated bus. Today, we honor their sacrifice. #BlackHistoryMonth
Dear Friends,FY 2020 appropriations requests for New Jersey's Tenth Congressional District are now open. Visit my website below and submit a complete application to be considered.Thanks,Donald M. Payne, Jr.Member of

Air traffic controllers handle, on average, more than 40,000 flights daily, across 19 million square miles of airspace. During the 35-day Government shutdown, they dealt with the added stress of not knowing when they’d receive their next paycheck.
More than 14,000 air traffic controllers, thousands of safety-critical FAA employees, and a number of safety inspectors and technicians worked during the shutdown without being paid. #AviationAtRisk
We didn’t need the last shutdown – and we don’t need another one now. The President should fully take the threat of another shutdown off the table sign the bipartisan agreement to #KeepGovernmentOpen.
Protecting TPS holders means protecting workers, families, friends, and neighbors.

This administration's child-separation policy is a stain on our nation. It is child abuse. The consequences will follow our country for generations.
By capping the SALT deduction, the #GOPTaxScam raised taxes on working families in New Jersey. State and local taxes pay for our schools, our police, and essential services we rely on. I'm proud to support the Bipartisan Stop the Attack on Local Taxpayers Act.
On Friday, I introduced a bipartisan resolution to recognize health and wellness coaches. Health coaches can decrease the cost of lifestyle-related diseases by helping people achieve their personal health and wellness
Twenty-nine years ago today, Nelson Mandela was freed from prison. His freedom inspired the world to keep up the struggle for human rights. The road is long, and we are still working to achieve Nelson Mandela's vision for a just world. His legacy is inspiration.
If you want to know about the border, listen to people who live and work there. Here’s my colleague, @RepEscobar, dishing some truth.
Here's a clip from yesterday's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing. I asked Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti about the future of ports and how to build good-paying jobs that can't be offshored.
Yesterday's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing was productive. It was an overdue conversation about how our nation can — and must — move forward with rebuilding our nation's infrastructure. Thanks to all the witnesses and to my colleagues.
John Dingell was a giant in the House. He fought fiercely for his constituents. He helped bring health care to millions of Americans. And he was a riot on Twitter. May he Rest In Peace, and may my colleague @RepDebDingell find peace and strength at this time.
It was a privilege to join #DominicansOnTheHill. Put the Trump administration on notice—we will fight the discriminatory citizenship question in the Census. We will stand up for public school and DREAMers and fair immigration. We are stronger because of our diversity!
Today is National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day. If you haven't yet, get tested. Talk to your doctor. Let's end the stigma surrounding HIV.

I just had a great meeting with Lynda Arnold and a big group of nurses representing Concerned Black Nurses of Newark and other organizations. We discussed maternal mortality, gun violence, the opioid crisis, and more. I’m grateful for their work.
Thanks to @MayorOfLA @ericgarcetti for describing the national importance of port innovation and interdependency. Port Newark is vital for the federal economy, and its success is reliant on the success of national infrastructure networks.
The Gateway Project is a nationally important project. A fifth of the national GDP is inextricably tied to the project’s success.
Secretary LaHood is a wonderful man who has done great work for the country. And he is still leading on transportation topics. It’s great to work with him to invest in America.
The Northeast Corridor Commission estimates that service disruptions caused by infrastructure failures, rail traffic congestion, and more costs the U.S. economy $500 million per year in lost productivity. My constituents deserve investments and answers. #TheCostOfInaction
America’s infrastructure was once the envy of the world, but today it is losing its battle against time, growth, and climate change. We need to take a bold, new approach — and we need to make the Gateway Project a reality. #TheCostOfInaction
I’m in the @TransportDems hearing listening to former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood discuss the need to rebuild America’s infrastructure.
Today, starting at 9:30 a.m., the @TransportDems will host a hearing on The Cost of Doing Nothing: Why Investing in Our Nation's Infrastructure Cannot Wait. Among other things, I'll be asking experts to discuss the importance of the Gateway Project.
Tune in to our first Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing. Among other things, we'll be talking about the Gateway Project.

Today on the House Floor, I honored a trailblazing first responder from Roselle, New Jersey—Rayna Latimer. Rayna is the first ever woman firefighter in Roselle's history. She's a hero and inspiration for girls across New Jersey. Thanks for your public service, Rayna!
Happy birthday to my friend, colleague, and a fierce advocate for New Jersey—@RepBonnie! It's going to be your best year yet.

The President’s use of our nation’s military as political pawns is disgraceful. When he says “we’ve heard” about caravans, he means he watched Fox News today. Shame! #SOTU

Today is the start of Black History Month. But it's not just about where we've come from . . . it's about where we are going. Together, we write history.
@realDonaldTrump You really don’t understand how to negotiate, do you?
@realDonaldTrump @foxandfriends You have the nation’s intelligence and homeland experts at your disposal, yet you rely on television for your briefings. Media moguls can manipulate you. Sad and dangerous.
We have to work hard to stamp out hate and bigotry—today and every day. On this #HolocaustMemorialDay, let’s join together to honor the six million Jews killed during the Holocaust. And let’s continue to pray for peace around the planet.

The Trump administration's disregard for civil rights and freedom is expressed in its transgender military ban. People should not be shut out from serving their country because of their identity.
On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, it’s important to remember that justice is not passive. Justice is not blind. Justice requires action to rectify historic and ongoing discrimination. Yes, let us reflect on his dream today. But let us also fight for freedom every day.
This is the reason oversight is so important.
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. would have been 90 years old today. He led our nation forward, but the journey hasn't ended. Now, more than ever, we need to join together in the fight for justice and equity. "It isn’t by size that you win or fail—Be the best of whatever you are."

It's a terrible idea, like most of the drivel that comes from Trump. Americans are not building his medieval wall. Let's talk about real border security—technology to detect drugs coming through ports of entry and to identify illegal border crossings—not a stupid wall.
Taking money away from Americans in Puerto Rico and reallocating it to build an ineffective border wall would exemplify Trump's twisted ideology.
This morning, I sat down with Anne Marie Sullivan and other representatives of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association to discuss the effects the Trump Shutdown is having on America's workers. The Senate needs to pass the House bills to reopen government.
The President may want to abandon first responders, but Congress won't.
The real crisis is the 800,000 American workers whose paychecks @realdonaldtrump is holding hostage. Look, we can agree on smart, effective border security solutions like new tech to scan for drugs and detect unauthorized crossings, but we are not building his stupid wall.
RT @washingtonpost: Fact Check: Trump did not accurately describe migrant children illegally brought into the United States
Our nation is best served by evidence-based strategies, not medieval monuments. #TrumpSpeech
Trump is a fear-monger who is unfit for the dignity of the White House.
@ChadPergram Democrats don't support the wall because it is a vanity project aimed at division. Democrats support evidence-based strategies, not medieval monuments.
This is a horrifying statistic: Last year, more than two dozen Native Americans went missing in Montana, most of them women. Violence against women is an epidemic, and it's disproportionately affecting women of color.

With all the talk about the #TrumpShutdown, there’s a great deal of confusion about what that actually means. Here’s a quick explainer on what the government shutdown means for Americans:
The #TrumpShutdown is dangerous for public safety and hurts Americans during the holidays.
There are more than 4,900 federal workers in New Jersey who will be furloughed or work without pay over Christmas because Donald Trump is throwing a tantrum for his vanity wall. Those are families who will suffer because of the #TrumpShutdown. Republicans need to learn to govern.
Despite the negativity swirling in Washington yesterday, I went to the House Floor to remind my colleagues that there are good people doing great things in our nation. I asked them to join me in honoring @LindenSchoolsNJ for Caroling for a Cause.
@realDonaldTrump If you want the stupid wall so bad, put on your overalls and find a trowel.
@realDonaldTrump Last time I checked, Republicans control the House and Senate.
Amid the negative news, let’s highlight that the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act recently passed. It will strengthen  public health infrastructure for Alzheimer’s and related dementias. I was proud to support the bill.
There's a Republican in the White House. Republicans are a majority in the Senate. Republicans have a majority in the House. If the government shuts down, putting hundreds of thousands of people's paychecks at risk over Christmas, it is because Republicans refuse to govern.
That's what we all say.
@realDonaldTrump Take the day off.
For those wondering whether Democrats would trade the Trump wall for the Gateway Project . . . no. Nobody wants Trump's stupid wall. We aren't trading the nation's most critical infrastructure project for a wasteful, ineffective,  environmentally unfriendly, egotistic wall.

Gun violence is heart wrenching. Today, I met with a survivor, a mother who lost her child to gun violence. One death is too many. In the 116th Congress, I will fight even harder to end the scourge of gun violence. Thank you to Newtown Action Alliance and all survivors.
The last major #GOPShutdown in 2013 cost the American economy 120,000 jobs and $24 billion. Republicans need to recognize they lost the election stop trying to hold the nation hostage to their radical demands.
