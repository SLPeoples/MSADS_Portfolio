I hope today produces honest conversations about the consequences illegal immigration has for American citizens, those who aspire to become American citizens, and people who suffer when others abuse our system.
If we don’t offer real solutions that consider legal status and enforce immigration law, we will undoubtedly repeat today’s discussion a few years from now—and history will judge us for shirking our responsibility.
The status quo isn’t practical. It’s not compassionate. And it’s absolutely not sustainable.
Day after day, parents give their children to smuggling cartels, employers have no reliable way of verifying an employee’s work eligibility documents, and adults who drag children through dangerous border crossings are rewarded with release into America’s interior.
Congress’ penchant for kicking the immigration can down the road is unsustainable and unfair to American citizens, legal immigrants, and everyone who respects our generous immigration system and hopes to make this country their home.
Legislation to provide legal status to certain illegal immigrant populations isn’t a new topic—Congress has been here before.
If Judiciary Democrats are concerned about “threats against the rule of law,” looks like they left some key names off their list: McCabe, Comey, Strzok, Lisa Page, Bruce Ohr, Baker, and Hillary Clinton . . . Not too late to add them.

In light of McCabe's new claims, I urge the Chairman to schedule a hearing immediately and demand the testimony of McCabe and DAG Rosenstein. If they refuse, the Judiciary Committee should compel their testimony.
Republicans have been asking about McCabe, Strzok, and Page—the triumvirate of corruption—for nearly two years. Now, it’s time to get those answers by bringing McCabe and DAG Rosenstein in front of the Judiciary Committee.
McCabe confirms: Conspiracy theory not a theory. During those 8 days in May, DOJ FBI officials contemplated the whip count for a coup?
