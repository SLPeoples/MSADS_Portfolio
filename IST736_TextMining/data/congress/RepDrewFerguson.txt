Elizabeth Warren's reckless plan would cripple American tech companies and internet freedom. Sweeping regulation that instills arbitrary revenue limits is the definition of overbearing government control of the internet
Always great to meet with President Morehead. I appreciate all the hard work you do for to the University of Georgia. #GoDawgs
I will continue to fight for those who defend our country. Thank you to the Georgia VFW for their dedicated work to assist our nation’s veterans.
It was great to talk to young farmers and ranchers from the @GaFarmBureau.
Members of the American Institute of Architects from #GA03 stopped in this week. I enjoyed our conversation on resources and funding to design safer schools.
Nothing in HR1 protects our citizens’ right to vote. In fact, provisions in this bill put the very security of our elections at risk. That's why I voted no on the Democrats' thinly veiled attempt to protect their majority
HR 1 completely overrides the state election laws that have secured our elections for over 200 years. Every American’s vote must be counted and protected, but H.R. 1 puts everyone’s vote at risk by federalizing our election process. Check out the graphic to learn more

Have a question for me? My first teletown hall of the 116th Congress is Wednesday at 6:30pm. Follow the link to sign up!
Ambassador Lighthizer I had productive conversations today about the tools #GA03 needs to be competitive in the global economy. I appreciate all of his work to modernize our nation's free trade agreements so that we can continue to be the best place in the world to do business.
Democrats claim HR 1 would increase access to voting, but the reality is HR 1 would federalize our election system and create major vulnerabilities in our electoral process
Thank you for stopping by!
Please join me in praying for Kenni and her family. I am so proud of the bravery they have shown in the face of this disease. #GA03
Thank you to Harris County Commissioner Harry Lange for stopping by my DC office to speak about the recent devastating tornado. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and all those affected.
Taxpayers shouldn't have to foot the bill for political campaigns. RT if you agree that your hard-earned tax dollars shouldn't go towards campaign attack ads
Yesterday I spoke with local leaders from Harris County and the surrounding area as they begin clean up efforts following Sunday’s storms. I commend their work and will do everything I can to help these #GA03 communities recover
American elections and the right to vote are the hallmark of our democracy. But instead of celebrating this inalienable right, Democrats are seeking to strangle it
Thank you to the Georgia Civil Air Patrol for stopping by the office last week!
It was an honor to receive the True Blue Award from the Family Research Council today. I remain committed to my pro-life values and will continue to fight for our nation’s most vulnerable.
House Dems are holding another show vote today on a gun measure that would do nothing to curb gun violence make it harder for law-abiding Americans to protect themselves. Meanwhile, Republicans are introducing solutions. I am proud to cosponsor the Mass Violence Prevention Act
We can all agree that we want to bring an end to gun violence, but H.R. 8 would do nothing to bring us closer to that goal despite Democrats' claims to the contrary
Democrats refused to listen to @SteveScalise's testimony as a survivor of gun violence. Instead of looking for real solutions, they are pushing disingenuous gun control policies that will do nothing to end gun violence
This is great news! #GA03 is proud to be home to the @Kia #Telluride
Coweta County Sheriff Mike Yeager has dedicated his career in law enforcement to keeping his community safe, and I know he will continue to serve our state and our nation well as the U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of Georgia

That’s why I am cosponsoring the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act which would prevent this unconscionable practice by making it a crime to deny treatment to any baby that survives an abortion
Recently we’ve seen lawmakers in Virginia and New York advocate for on-demand abortion and even blatant infanticide. This is abhorrent. Medical providers are sworn to do no harm, and yet these policies would legalize the murder of newborn infants. We cannot allow this to stand.
I’ve called West Point home my entire life, and I share the story of my hometown with everyone I meet in DC. Our success story would not have been possible without the investment of @Kia and the hard working Georgians I am so proud to call my neighbors

Democrats need to stop playing political games with federal workers' paychecks and start working with @POTUS to secure our border and open the federal government
As we honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., let us strive to follow his example of serving others and remember his message of freedom and equality for all #MLKDay
The President has put forward a serious proposal that would reopen our government and secure our borders, but Democrats still refuse to even come to the table to participate in negotiations. It's long past time for Democratic leaders to quit playing these political games
I firmly believe that life begins at conception, and I will continue to stand up for the unborn #ProLife

As we find out which House Democrats were on this secret beachapalooza in Puerto Rico over the weekend instead of working to reopen the government, I’ll be sending them some aloe vera and Advil to help them recover so they can get back to work
It is long past time for the Democrats to stop playing political games and come to the negotiating table. But instead they've voted to go home for the weekend again
RT if you agree that we should focus on investing in the future of rural Americans instead of Washington bureaucrats
Rural broadband is critical to ensure folks across #GA03 have access to the same 21st century opportunities as their neighbors in large cities. Unfortunately, yesterday Democrats voted to prioritize spending money on federal office buildings instead of rural broadband programs
It is great to meet with student groups from #GA03 while they are in Washington. Thank you to the Trinity High School students for stopping by!
.@GovernorDeal has done terrific work for the great state of Georgia. Please join me in thanking him for his service
In fact, Democrats have failed to offer a meaningful counterproposal to secure our border and end the shutdown. RT if you agree that it’s time for Democrats to get serious about our nation’s border security and reopening the federal government
The President and Republicans in Congress stand ready to negotiate to reopen the government and invest in our nation’s border security and a border wall system. Instead of coming to the table, House Democrats are holding show votes on bills they know the Senate will not consider
Please take a moment today to join me in thanking the law enforcement officers across #GA03. These brave men and women put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay
Democrats are focused on scoring political points instead of solutions

Democratic leaders have not worked for solutions to secure our border fund our government. Instead, they’ve focused on assigning blame winning political points. I continue to stand with the American people President Trump to fund our government and enforce our nation’s laws
Protecting the homeland starts with securing our borders. I am proud to stand with President Trump and voted to fund a wall along our southern border
I am proud that Georgia has led the way in this area and of the work my colleagues in the Georgia delegation have done to get the #FirstStepAct across the finish line in
The #FirstStepAct is a landmark step in reforming our criminal justice system to prioritize public safety and help prevent recidivism by providing training and educational programs for prisoners

My prayers are with President Bush’s loving family and many friends. As we mourn the loss of this inspiring leader, I also hope we will honor his legacy by serving others in our own lives.
As a WWII Navy veteran, Congressman, Ambassador to the UN, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, Director of the CIA, Vice President and 41st President of the United States, there is no question that President Bush devoted his life to serving his fellow Americans.
He once said that ‘the American Dream means giving it your all, trying your hardest, accomplishing something. And then I'd add to that, giving something back. No definition of a successful life can do anything but include serving others.’
President George H.W. Bush was a man of integrity and humility and a devoted public servant throughout his life.
I am humbled by the outpouring of support I've received from the good people of #GA03 this week. None of this would be possible without you. I am excited for this opportunity to better serve the folks of the Third District in the 116th Congress
