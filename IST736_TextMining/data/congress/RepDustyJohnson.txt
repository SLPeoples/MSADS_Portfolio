I want to thank @SecAFOfficial for her service to our nation. She brought #SouthDakota values to the @usairforce and they are better because of it. @utep is lucky to have you, Madam Secretary!
#HR1 would strip power from the states and essentially federalize our nation’s elections. Washington D.C. has enough problems, there’s no need to hand over more of the state’s authority to D.C. bureaucrats.
#HR1 is full of flaws, but what’s most startling is the billions of #taxpayer dollars that would go towards political campaigns. The American people should not be forced to foot the bill for TV political ads of candidates they don’t agree with.

It’s disappointing Congress has to pass another resolution to condemn bigotry in the first place, it’s even more disappointing that it took Democrats nearly a week to negotiate language to condemn insensitive racist comments. We should hold ourselves to a higher standard.
Tonight I supported another resolution condemning anti-Semitism and bigotry. Anti-Semitism has no place in our politics, nor our country. Period.
Had a great meeting with SD @VFWHQ leadership today. Congress did its job by passing the #VAMissionAct. Now the #VA must implement the new community care program right.
#HR1 is another impractical proposal by my Democrat colleagues. But of all the ridiculous proposals included in #HR1, I find this the most troubling: Millions of your taxpayer dollars would go directly towards politicians’ campaigns, including those you can’t stand. #NoThanks

@DerekBTodd24 @Aberdeen_CHS @AberdeenNews Effective news outlets and effective legislatures are both necessary for good governance, but the similarities don’t end there. The best news outlets mix hard news deep analysis with stories that celebrate our communities the human spirit. Congress is the same way.
