The Constitution is clear: Congress has the power of the purse. If the President’s emergency declaration is allowed to stand, it will undermine the balance of power between the President and Congress and set a dangerous precedent. #FakeEmergency

Trump fails to grasp the unimaginable conditions these migrants are fleeing in Central America. Last Congress, I introduced legislation to help reunite separated families and address the root causes that push Central Americans to migrate to our country.
The only crisis is the one the President created. This policy has already led to the deaths of two children and will undoubtedly create lifelong trauma. Pres. Trump must invest in Central America to address root causes of migration rather than threatening to cut off aid. (4/5)
The Administration claimed border patrol stopped 4,000 potential terrorists from crossing the border in 2018. The real number? SIX. (3/5)
There is only a TRUMP MANUFACTURED crisis at the southern border. According to the Homeland Security Dept. illegal immigration on the Southern border has REACHED THE LOWEST LEVEL ON RECORD, but the President continues to pressure Congress to fund AN INEFFECTIVE BORDER WALL. (2/5)
Trump has been threatening to call a national emergency if he doesn’t get $5 billion to fix the “crisis” HE CREATED at the Southern border. The fear-mongering the President has spread is wildly incorrect and will not solve the immigration issues our country faces. (1/5)
