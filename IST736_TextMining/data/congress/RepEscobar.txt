I had the privilege of being the El Paso County Judge for many yrs helped hire the current medical examiner. I can attest to his integrity professionalism and to the fact that some testing is done out of town, causing delays. I’d bet there is a logical reason for this delay.
9. Climate change is creating uninhabitable living conditions for Central Americans.10. Our inability to see what unfolded before us brought us to this moment.11. Unless there are monumental changes, this is our new normal.Our inability to face these challenges IS the crisis.
7. US consumption of palm oil products is driving Central American families from their land, forcing them to chose between starvation or forced migration. 8. US meddling in Central America has created instability that forces them to choose between violence or forced migration.
5. The Migrant Protection Protocols are creating a limbo for migrants, making them more vulnerable to human trafficking and kidnapping.6. Pushing migrants to MX makes their legal cases tougher because they can’t access counsel (now we know some lawyers are on a govt watch list)
4. Trump’s policy of pushing migrants to rural, desolate areas (because ports of entry are blocked to to those LEGALLY seeking asylum) is making the work of Border Patrol agents in outlying areas far more difficult and migrants’ passage more dangerous — that’s a man made problem
Facts:1. This challenge was made far worse by the incompetence of @DHSgov and the cruelty of @realDonaldTrump. 2. The US has known for the last 5 years that migration patterns changed. Five years!3. In that time, DHS ignored alarms raised by their agents and border communities
Fewer judges = longer waiting for asylum hearings = making a bad situation worse. Oh, yes, there is a crisis. A crisis of leadership. A White House that turns challenges into chaos.

If @realDonaldTrump continues to ignore the root causes, we can expect the situation to get worse. It’s time for @DHSgov and the Trump @WhiteHouse to end their incompetence and inhumane policies!
Furthermore, the Trump administration made a growing challenge even worse by implementing policies that focus on cruelty and deterrence and by failing to create a long-term plan to stem future migration flows.
The @DHSgov has known about the changing migration patterns for five years. They did nothing to prepare for it and ignored the alarm sounded by their own agents and El Paso

I’ve expressed concern that Ft Bliss funding may be on the list including any not-yet-obligated funds for the hospital
This lack of compassion for children who have been profoundly traumatized by govt-led kidnapping govt-sanctioned child abuse is shocking. And to politicize grieving families — whose pain has nothing to do with these children or the accountability we seek — is deeply disturbing
At @HouseJudiciary hearing on family separation, ranking member @RepDougCollins identifies grieving audience members whose family members were killed by an undocumented immigrant. To my knowledge, not a single child separated from their parents at our borders has killed anyone.
I’m so grateful to be on this journey with you @RepMGS, as we fight for more humane border and immigration policies and accountability for those who led government-sponsored kidnapping through family separation.
