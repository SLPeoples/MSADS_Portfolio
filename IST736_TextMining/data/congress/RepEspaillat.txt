Clapper: #Trump ordering Kushner clearance is dangerous. There were several red flags presented by national security experts about #JaredKushner I introduced the #JAREDAct2019 to prevent Trump from putting us in dangerous territory ever again.
#JaredKushner failed to disclose hundreds of foreign contacts; he has ties to Russian banks; while serving in the White House, Kushner took meetings with executives from banks who subsequently gave Kushner Co. hundreds of millions in loans. #JAREDAct2019
By ordering to grant his son-in-law, #JaredKushner, a top-secret security clearance overruling concerns flagged by intelligence officials and the White House’s top lawyer, #Trump has once again put our national security at risk. #JAREDAct2019
My bill, the “JARED Act,” requires Congressional oversight if relatives or financial associates of @realDonaldTrump are granted security clearances contrary to the advice or recommendation of a background investigation.
Forced arbitration has warped our justice system. It gives special interests and corporations a free pass while stacking the deck against hard working Americans. this must end. I’m proud to join @SenBlumenthal, @RepHankJohnson , and @RepJerryNadler to introduce the #FairAct.

The FAIR Act would greatly restore American’s rights to seek justice and accountability when hurt by a corporation. #EndForcedArbitration#FairAct
More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks. That’s why I voted to pass #HR8, a bipartisan bill to #EndGunViolence and expand background checks – and it’s why I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to do the same.
We can’t afford efforts to make gun violence prevention a partisan issue. Americans demand action to #EndGunViolence. We must make the Bipartisan Background Checks Act law.
In 2017, 23% of cases where a gun was transferred to a prohibited purchaser involved someone who has been convicted of domestic violence or who had a restraining order. We must fix the #CharlestonLoophole to keep these weapons from falling into the wrong hands! #HR1112
The #CharlestonLoophole allows someone to purchase a firearm even if their background check has not been completed within the 3-day period. This is dangerous and allows people with criminal backgrounds and mental illnesses to become gun owners. #HR1112
In 2017, 6,004 background checks were denied after the initial 3-day waiting period. #HR1112 would allow the FBI more time to run background checks so we can stop prohibited gun owners from slipping through the cracks.#CharlestonLoophole

This is why I continue my fight. Hate and racism have no place in our society, and domestic terrorists like the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacy groups have no place in a country as beautiful as ours.
Thank you @NewYorkStateAG for joining this effort. We will NOT tolerate and allow this #TrumpFakeEmergency to undermine the values we hold dear as a nation. #FakeEmergency
The ⁦@CBP⁩ is failing at its responsibility to meet basic human needs and standards as yet another individual has died while in its custody. 
RT @zabalaaldia: @RepEspaillat Says @MSNBC Trump’s Declaration of National Emergency is a “Fabrication” and is very concerning.
I stand with @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer to defend the Constitution. The #TrumpFakeEmergency scam violates our system of checks balances, and undermines our Founders’ vision for our country. @MSNBC @KatyTurNBC
If an emergency can be manufactured over border security when illegal border crossings are near a 20-year low… then it’s a snap to make the case for an emergency over gun deaths, which are near a 20-year high. ⁦#TrumpFakeEmergency @MSNBC⁩
#TrumpFakeEmergency is a fabricated emergency. Every member of Congress should be concerned about #Trump’s reckless behavior. #MSNBC ⁦@KatyTurNBC⁩
Tune in to ⁦@MSNBC⁩ today at 2:45pm for my segment with ⁦@KatyTurNBC⁩ to discuss the #TrumpFakeEmergency

I’m proud to join @JoaquinCastrotx and our colleagues to terminate #Trump’s unconstitutional emergency declaration. #FakeEmergency
He admits it’s a #FakeTrumpEmergency...
It’s time for Republicans to do the right thing and reject the #FakeTrumpEmergency!
Delighted to meet Dr. Carla Hayden @LibnOfCongress this week. The @librarycongress is cataloguing the book “Once and Future Muse,” the first major study of the life and work of Dominican-born bilingual American poet and translator Rhina P. Espaillat.
Mothers with their children fleeing to the U.S. to seek asylum is not an emergency. The persistent #GunViolence in America is an undeniable emergency. #PrayForAurora #aurorastrong
RT @RepRobinKelly: Another tragedy today in Aurora; we cannot normalize this madness. We need to #DoSomething. #HR8 #HR1112
