An important reminder that this is not a partisan issue. The separation of children and parents must stop now.
Jose presented himself to immigration officers at the border, along with his 1-yr-old son, to seek asylum from violence. After 4 days in custody, he was separated from his son moved 1,000 miles away. In what world is this ok?
Family unity is recognized as a fundamental human right, enshrined in international law. The Trump Administration’s proposal and subsequent actions to separate immigrant families flies in the face of this norm. It must stop. #FamiliesBelongTogether
