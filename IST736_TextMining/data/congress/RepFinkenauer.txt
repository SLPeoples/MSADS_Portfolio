Iowa’s redistricting has been held up by both Ds Rs since 1980 as a system that works by putting politics aside. Happy to secure Iowa’s legacy w/ the passage of the Finkenauer Amendment to HR 1, focused on ending political corruption making sure govt works #forthepeople #ia01
I want to hear from you! Join me this Saturday for ‘Conversations with your Congresswoman.’ My staff will also be on hand to help anyone needing assistance with a federal agency. #ia01
For every $1 we invest in infrastructure, the economy gains $2.50. At today’s House Small Business hearing, I asked how we can make sure #ia01 small businesses benefit from those investments.
Ready to bring an Iowa voice perspective as an Assistant Whip. Working every day to help find balanced solutions to the issues facing our communities our country. #ia01
Thank you @InfraWeek Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative! Great conversation on what real investments in infrastructure can do for our Mississippi River communities. And of course, always good to see @CityofDubuque Mayor Buol!
Tune in for today’s @HouseSmallBiz hearing on smallbusinesses infrastructure!
Love it when Iowans visit DC! Great to meet with Preston of Nashua this morning who is visiting DC for the first time ever with ABATE of Iowa. Have a great trip, Preston!
Loved reading the story of one employee’s 52 years at the @JohnDeere plant in Waterloo from today’s @wcfcourier. Enjoy retirement, Mr. Converse!
I was elected to give #ia01 a seat at the table. After my visit to Precision Metalworks in Maquoketa, I spoke about the impressive work they do with other rural entrepreneurs during @HouseSmallBiz hearing. It’s critical @sbagov hears what works to spur innovation in our state!
Farmers in #ia01 still hurting from POTUS Twitter trade war. IA families literally can’t afford the pain. I’ll keep working every day to make sure the administration folks across DC hear the reality of their decisions We can’t be ignored any

My view in @TransportDems while we dive into how infrastructure policy can help mitigate adapt to climate change. Important concrete (see what I did there? :) ) work ahead in #ia01!
Tune in for our conversation on the need for more resilient infrastructure with @TransportDem’s:
I hear it across #ia01 now the there’s a poll to prove it! Iowans want to stay in Iowa. That’s why I’m working for investments in infrastructure, housing trade schools to keep hardworking Iowans here create opportunity for friends, kids grandkids to come back home. �‍️
Great to spend time w/ @CSPANCities as they showcased @CityofCRiowa! Always proud to share the communities that make #IA01 special.
Spent the morning w/ leaders from @northerniowa’s Business Community Services program discussing job growth rural development. Incredible resource for #IA01 businesses at all stages of development. Proud to fight for them on @HouseSmallBiz!

One of my favorite parts of the job - meeting with Iowans of all ages!
(2/2) I urge my Senate colleagues to put country and Iowa over party and call out this Administration's reckless games. This chaos and dysfunction are now risking funds that #IA01 is counting on for the CR flood wall. I'll fight every day to not let that happen.
(1/2)We need to keep our borders secure our government running. That’s why Congress came together passed a bipartisan spending bill. Declaring a national emergency, defying our constitution, taking billions of unauthorized taxpayer dollars ignores important checks balances.
My statement on reports that President Trump will declare a national
It’s been 1 year since #Parkland. We must always work to do better honor the lives we lost. I’m happy to see #hr8 pass out of committee continue to move forward. Thank you to the students parents across our country who have demanded we legislate w/ common sense solutions.
Thrilled to see @UTC partnering with @GirlsWhoCode to expand computer science training programs and close the gender gap in #STEM fields throughout the

Proud to join roll out of the #FAMILYAct. Iowans deserve more than talking points, they deserve legislation that reflects the values we grew up with. It’s time EVERY parent, including adoptive, can spend time w/ their child families can care for each other w/o economic anxiety.
Great to meet w/ representatives from @SpecialOlympics Iowa. Today Special Olympics athletes, program leaders family members from across the country are meeting w/their representatives to inform them of the importance of expanding Unified Champion Schools health initiatives.
What an incredible honor to preside over the U.S. House of Representatives today as Speaker Pro Tempore as members honored the lifetime of service Congressman Dingell gave to our country.
Happening Now: Presiding over the House Floor for the first time since elected to Congress.   � Tune in! �  here
Today is my first committee hearing w/ @TransportDems! I'm eager to address the infrastructure crisis facing our country. Did you know Iowa has the worst bridges in the US? Iowa drivers cross structurally deficient bridges more than 1.3 million times every day. #TheCostOfInaction
Too many Iowans suffered during the government shutdown. Today I joined my colleagues on @housesmallbiz to listen to small business owners talk about the risks of another reckless shutdown.
Tune in!
Lots of thoughts about tonight’s #SOTU, but for now, taking a moment to celebrate that for the first time in our nation’s history during the President’s address, on the floor of the US House sat some Congresswomen from Iowa. Proud to serve with @RepCindyAxne
RT @iowademocrats: Oh hey, it’s Iowa’s first Congresswomen, @RepFinkenauer and @RepCindyAxne. �� #SOTU
Honored to share the #SOTU w/Jesse. He lives in West Union called me during the shutdown bc his FSA coworkers were struggling. This is not the way we treat the ppl helping our farmers. I listened promised to do everything I could to stop it from happening again.
'Folks are tired of the chaos division.' Great to talk to @NPR about tonight's #SOTU. We need real action on the issues affecting #IA01 families. 
Celebrating the birthday and incredible legacy of civil rights activist Rosa Parks today. #BlackHistoryMonth
Such an honor to tour the Iowa Veteran’s Home in #Marshalltown today to meet with the residents dedicated staff. We need to treat all of our heroes with dignity and honor their service through policies that work for them and their families.

As the severe cold continues throughout our region, please take the time to familiarize yourself w/ these resources. Also, please check in on elderly neighbors others who are the most vulnerable to the cold. #PolarVotex2019
Proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act! This isn’t just about what’s right what’s fair – it’s also about the economic security of Iowa’s families.
Today, we sent a message: shutdowns are unacceptable, they are dangerous they are irresponsible. This is a new day in Washington. We are here to put chaos dysfunction aside. We are here to do our jobs we are here to get back to work. #ShutdownToEndAllShutdowns
Today I was appointed Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development, Agriculture, Trade Entrepreneurship. I look forward to bringing our #Iowa values to the national conversation about how we move our economy forward by investing in rural development innovative ideas.
In Iowa, women are paid 77 cents for every dollar men earn. That’s a gap of $11,034/year. On the 10th anniversary of the #LillyLedbetter Fair Pay Act, we celebrate the pioneering women who have fought for equal pay roll up our sleeves to continue their work.
‘We owe it to our federal employees, farmers, every American impacted by this shutdown to come together w/ a core understanding that working families should never again be used as bargaining chips, by this administration or the next.’
Nice letter to the Editor in today's @wcfcourier on my bill, the Stimulutating Innovation through Procurement Act of 2019! I'll continue to fight for more opportunities for all Iowans in Congress.
Wonderful meeting with Waterloo Mayor @QuentinHart to discuss entrepreneurship, affordable housing, infrastructure! We need to support innovative, local solutions to the challenges our communities face.
RT @HouseSmallBiz: Welcome to the Small Business Committee, @RepFinkenauer!
Excited to announce that I’ll be serving on the Small Business Committee! Whether we’re talking about businesses that have been in the same family for generations or new businesses just starting up, I’ll make sure they’re able to grow innovate.
Congratulations to DBQ’s Sunnycrest Manor team, rated a 5 star facility by Medicare! These public employees make sure folks receive the care they need in the DBQ community they love. Way to
The shutdown is making it harder for students families to plan. Folks work hard their whole lives so the next generation can do better. It’s what our country is about. It’s time the Administration Senate stop using Iowa families as bargaining chips.
RT @KCRG: Here's a view from a plow truck on I-380 in Cedar Rapids this morning. Be careful as you head out!
Stay safe in Iowa right now with this heavy snow! Huge thank you to all the snow plow drivers, state patrol, first responders and all the many emergency personnel focused on keeping Iowans safe today!
I was honored to spend the weekend celebrating Iowans who continue Dr. King’s legacy with their commitment to justice service to #IA01 communities. Inspiring events in Waterloo, DBQ, CR!
Excited to work with a bipartisan group of women in Congress to support working families! @WCPInst
Proud to share I've been appointed to the Transportation Infrastructure Committee! Smart investments in infrastructure create good jobs help businesses get their goods to consumers. #IA01 can’t afford C-minus graded roads. Let’s get to
Thank you @iowahospital, @daveloebsack, @RepCindyAxne for a great conversation about supporting Iowa’s health care providers patients!
Such a pleasure to speak with the Commander of the 1st Army this morning! Grateful for the service of the men women in uniform committed to supporting them their families.
Walking over to vote with the @DrakeUniversity students who just visited the office! Loved our conversation and a chance to visit with students from my alma mater.
Inspired by the grit teamwork of the neighborhoods small businesses in Marshalltown. Thanks to the team at Black Tire for showing me around!
Honored to serve alongside these amazing women!
Yesterday, I visited Marshalltown neighborhoods small businesses still rebuilding after the tornado. Inspired by their spirit determined to make sure they have the support they need to recover
Got the chance to sit down w/ @RepJohnCurtis to discuss our bill, H.R. 246. Honored to work w/ him to put govt to work for our small businesses:
We can find space to work together and we should. Proud my first bill was bipartisan focused on helping small business and folks in rural communities that are often forgotten in DC. @RepJohnCurtis it was an honor, let’s do more or this... our democracy demands it. �
Proud to have passed my 1st bill in Congress w/ @RepJohnCurtis! H.R. 246 helps small businesses compete for govt. contracts research grants. 1st bill passed by a new member of Congress this session! Watch my floor speech here:
RT @tbweig: Iowa @RepFinkenauer delivered a speech on the House floor today for her first submitted bill, H.R. 246, the Stimulating Innovat…
About to speak on the House floor on my bill! Tune into C-SPAN at 3.
Cedar Rapids has waited a decade for this funding. It’s flat-out irresponsible to gamble with people’s lives livelihoods, whether they’re govt workers or communities hit by disasters.
Proud to introduce my 1st bill w/ my GOP colleague @RepJohnCurtis to help small businesses, especially in rural communities. Let’s make sure the next generation of Iowans can innovate right here in #IA01.
Our farmers couldn’t afford another hit after a trade war started on Twitter. Now, they can’t turn to the agencies that are supposed to help them or get the data they need to plan for this
Proud to stand with federal workers with @AFGENational, @AFLCIO, and other unions today. They keep us safe, help our farmers small businesses, and look out for consumers. And we should never treat them or their families like poker chips.
#TBT signing my oath of office. “I will bear true faith allegiance…” Words I’ll remember act on every day for the people of Iowa’s First.
1.1 million Iowans are counting on a functioning government to get their tax refunds back. That’s why I’m proud to have voted to re-open IRS key agencies, putting money back in the pockets of Iowans—and again urge the Senate to do the same.
I came to Washington to put government back to work for everyday Iowans. That means having a government that’s up running while both parties negotiate.
Great visiting with Randy Andrew from UNI! Our universities don’t just provide opportunities for our students—research at our schools strengthens Iowa’s economy. Go Panthers!
Honored to share my swearing-in with the people of #IA01 my parents, who taught me the values I’ll fight for here in Congress. Schools, health care, infrastructure and so much more are on the line. Ready to get to work!
