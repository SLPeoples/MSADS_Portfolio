Proud we passed #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, to make sure that our government is of, by, and for the people.
It's been a fast-paced week of meetings and votes in DC. Thankful for the opportunity to meet with #TX07 constituents and organizations fighting for people in the district, including @AWEA, @HAAOnline, @WeAreALPA, the #CysticFibrosis community, and @MGTracyNorris.
Happy International #WomensDay! #BalanceIsBetter—because gender balance in business, government, income, and more leads to thriving communities. Proud to be a member of a growing group of women in Congress and excited to see what progress we can make.
Last year, the @StateDept eliminated #ReproRights from its annual Human Rights Report. But #ReproRightsAreHumanRights. That's why I co-sponsored legislation to ensure its inclusion in future reports.
I'm proud to co-sponsor the 2019 #VAWA Reauthorization Act, introduced today to ensure access to justice and services for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.
Six years ago today, President Obama signed into law the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, which expanded protections for victims across the U.S.
Loved getting to talk with @ChrisEvans today about politics, progress, and  pressing issues. Engaging people in the political process may be his next superpower. Can't wait to see what he does with it!
Reports of Texas' refusal to accept help from @NASA to gather data after Harvey are troubling.  That’s why @RepEBJ, @RepSherrill, and I have sent a letter to @EPA asking for more information relating to this decision.
Another important hearing this morning.  Watch the live stream at the link below.
Today, the @HouseScience Subcommittee on Energy is meeting to discuss the intersection of energy and water. Watch live:
Thanks to the @EmeryWeiner 8th graders for coming to D.C., braving the cold, asking great questions, making me feel like a rock star today!
The same holds true for bigotry in all forms, and we must work together to combat it wherever we see it.I am privileged to represent many Muslims in TX-07, and I am proud to do so.
The anti-Muslim vitriol directed at Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is an affront—to her, and to all Americans. These anti-Muslim attacks and threats have no place in our state houses or our political discourse.
Bigotry and hate in the form of Islamophobia run counter to our fundamental values—as a community of inclusion and collaboration, and as Americans of many religions who cherish the right to free exercise.
The community I represent is one of the most diverse in the country. We celebrate that diversity, including our rich diversity of religious belief. In my district—and across America—our Muslim neighbors are important members of our community.
Also enjoyed meeting with @HoustonPubMedia and @txbroadcasters to hear about the many ways that our local media serves our community. In #TX07, we know how important it is to have an informed, engaged community.
And great visits with friends from @HoustonFoodBank, the Gulf Coast Authority, @LegacyCommunity, and others. Thanks for taking the time to meet with me about issues critical to #TX07!
Headed back to D.C. for another week full of constituent meetings after a great week last week meeting with @AmerAcadPeds, @NALC_National, @SpaceCenterHou, and students from Bellaire in town for @CloseUp_DC.
Proud to be a part of #HERStory in the 116th Congress, where more women are serving than ever before. This #WomensHistoryMonth, we are reminded of the women who worked to get us here, and the women who we work for every day. Glad to work #ForThePeople with these @HouseDemWomen.
Congratulations to @NASA and @SpaceX on this morning’s amazing feat!
Happy Texas Independence Day, y’all!
Today is #ReadAcrossAmericaDay, an important reminder to encourage the nation's kids to get lost in a good book. Those impressions can last a lifetime. I can’t help but think of "Go Dog Go" when I see the many dogs meeting in the lobby of my D.C. building.
A short time later, I joined my colleagues in the House in voting for HR 1112 to close the "Charleston Loophole" and improve our background check system. These common-sense measures matter.
Yesterday morning, I had the privilege of hearing from Mrs. Jennifer Pinckney, whose husband was murdered leading Bible study in Charleston’s Emanuel AME Church.
Happy #WomensHistoryMonth! Countless incredible women have shaped the world we live in today. Let’s celebrate them and learn from them.
#OTD in 1953, James Watson and Francis Crick proposed the double helix structure of DNA, based on the work of Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. What they claimed was “the secret of life,” we remember as one of the most significant scientific achievements.
Great catching up with some fellow Texans this morning at the @TXStateSociety breakfast to give an update on Congress and talk about the importance of working together and making our Texas voices heard. Thanks for having me!
Today is a new day: Congress took bipartisan action to keep us safe by passing #HR8, common-sense universal background check legislation that #TX07 residents have told me overwhelmingly they support — as do the majority of
RT @RepAnnieKuster: I’m proud to stand with my colleagues today as we vote to expand background checks to all gun sales, which is supported…
There is nothing more sacred in our democracy than the right to vote. That’s why I'm an original co-sponsor of the #VRAA.  For voters today, voters tomorrow, and those who sacrificed so much to secure the right, we must #RestoreTheVote.
Appreciate and agree with Ranking Member @RepMarshall's comment at today's hearing that we should all strive to work to "leave the world better than we found it." Glad to work with him and the entire subcommittee to do so.
RT @HouseScience: READ Chair @RepFletcher's opening statement at today's hearing, “Sea Change: Impacts of Climate Change on Our Oceans and…
This morning I will be presiding over my first @HouseScience Subcommittee on Environment hearing. We will learn from expert witnesses how climate change is affecting our oceans and coasts. Watch live here:
I voted to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The LWCF has invested over $577 million to protect Texas' public lands, historic sites, increase recreational opportunities. We must take care of the places we love in Texas.

#OTD in 1919, Grand Canyon National Park was established. Happy 100 years @GrandCanyonNPS! To celebrate #GrandCanyon100, @NatGeoTravel created a photo gallery that highlights the beauty of one of our nation’s great wonders, explore here:
Consistent with the oath of office I took to protect defend our Constitution, I co-sponsored today’s resolution to terminate President Trump's emergency declaration. We must protect the balance of power the checks on that power our founders envisioned.
Today, @TransportDems are focusing on ways to mitigate the effects of climate change and make our infrastructure more resilient. You can watch live here:
I was glad to join @Sysco @NRGenergy to celebrate the “Sysco Power Patch” — a new renewable energy collaboration. It is an example of what we can do when we work together, and of how our community will keep leading the way on energy, with creativity, technology, and commitment.
And, of course, it was important and helpful to check in with elected leaders about how we can work together.  Thanks to Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, and Bellaire Mayor Andrew Friedburg and team for their time — and their partnership.
It was a great week out of the office, too.  Enjoyed meeting with Houstonians leading us in so many ways from across our diverse community — from academics to business to charities to flood control.  Working together, we accomplish so much.
Headed back to D.C. after a great week at home.  My team and I enjoyed meeting with many constituents in our new Houston office. Thanks to all who came to visit. Our #TX07 team is here ready to work for you.
64 years ago today, U.S. Marines raised the flag on #IwoJima. They fought for 5 more weeks and tens of thousands died. The flag unfurled to every breeze, from dawn to setting sun... today we honor the memory of every single one. #SemperFi
Loved talking with the @GHPartnership this morning at its Future of Texas series. I'm grateful for opportunities to speak with this group and others recently, including @AmChemistry and @CCLHouston about working together.
The Trump admin misunderstands Title X funding, conflating family planning w/ abortion. Title X funding—born in #TX07—is for contraception, screenings, and care.All this rule does is make getting care more difficult for women who need it most.
Happy #GoTexanDay! Are you wearing your cowboy boots and hat today?
RT @GHPartnership: Thank you @RepFletcher for sharing your thoughts on the Future of Texas with Partnership members this morning. We look f…
64 years ago today, the #MontgomeryBusBoycott protested an unjust, segregated public transit system. All concerned Americans must continue their fight for equality by challenging injustice where they see it. #BlackHistoryMonth
It's #IntroduceAGirlToEngineeringDay! Girls and women are known to be creatively oriented, which is a vital element in engineering—yet it is a male-dominated field. Hope you spent time today teaching the girls in your life about engineering and will do so throughout the year!
Happy Birthday, @RepJohnLewis! A fighter, a leader, and a #GoodTrouble maker that I'm proud to call my colleague and my friend.
Good seeing you, @judgekc!
This #PresidentsDay, the tradition of reading George Washington’s farewell address is especially important. I read it this morning, inspired by the vision for our union that shaped it—and shaped us all.
Another great week in D.C. meeting with constituents organizations working to improve the lives of people in #TX07, including @NASA_Johnson, @LULAC, @AFGENational Local 1633, @TexasWheat, and @EDFAction. Thanks for visiting! Looking forward to seeing folks in Htown next week!
The President’s declaration of a national emergency to obtain funding for his border wall is an abuse of power and an abuse of the process our founders envisioned. I will work with my colleagues to fight this end run around our Constitution, our democracy.
Among the good things in the bipartisan spending bill that the President signed into law yesterday is the removal of language that blocked transportation funds for
Another senseless, heartbreaking act of gun violence. My thoughts are with the victims and their families.
Tonight, I voted in favor of the bipartisan, bicameral government spending bill. It's not perfect, it is a compromise that will responsibly fund the government and keep it working #ForThePeople.Our constituents sent us here to work together, and that is what we have done.
Yesterday, experts shared their important research on climate science with @HouseScience. I asked how we can best engage a diverse coalition to work together on this challenge. They made clear involving academia, industry, government at all levels is both possible necessary.
Today, I #StandWithParkland and remember the 17 people killed in a senseless act of gun violence one year ago today at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. My thoughts are of them, and with their loved ones and friends who have worked through their grief to heal and to #EndGunViolence.
One in three women dies of cardiac disease or stroke every year. I am proud to #GoRedWearRed with my colleagues in Congress to raise awareness to prevent heart disease. #AmericanHeartMonth
This is #TeamFletcher taking over Twitter to say happy birthday, Congresswoman! Thank you for the hard work you do every day. Glad we pulled off the surprise!

At our first hearing today, the @HouseScience Committee will hear from the nation's experts on our changing climate and why it is so important that we address it. You can watch it live here at 10 am:
I loved the energy in the room this morning when I spoke to members of @AFGENational. These public servants work hard for us every day -- even when our leaders have failed them. I'm glad my colleagues in Congress have worked together to make sure our government stays open.
Looking for another way to keep up with my work in Congress and #TX07? Be sure to follow my Instagram account!
For 110 years, the @NAACP has worked to make its vision of a society in which all individuals have equal rights without discrimination based on race a reality. On this anniversary of its founding, we celebrate the work the NAACP has done and is doing to make it so.
We remember the incredible life service of former Rep. John Dingell of Michigan. His work in Congress stands as an example of how one person can make a difference for so many. My thoughts are with @RepDebDingell their family during this difficult time.
I join my colleagues in condemning the recent anti-Semitic comments and call for unity. And I join my constituents in the hope that with awareness and with action—as we sang together in October—we shall overcome.
I have the privilege of representing the heart of Houston’s Jewish community in #TX07. Together, we have seen a rise in anti-semitism, intolerance, and bigotry in recent years. It has no place in the U.S. House of Representatives.
There are serious questions the @TransportDems will address that are essential for our district. During our first full committee meeting this week, I asked a panel of experts about how we build a more resilient infrastructure.
Houston Police Chief @ArtAcevedo is a force of nature incredible advocate.  I'm so glad to have this Houston representative in Washington this week to speak to Congress about preventing gun violence.
Investing in clean water infrastructure should not be controversial. For every $1 billion invested in America’s water infrastructure, 27,000 jobs are created or sustained while improving public health and the environment—all at the same time. #TheCostOfInaction
Houston's legacy of exploration is best exemplified by the people who have set a course for outer space, to learn more about the universe and our place in it. Today, #NASARemembers, and we honor the sacrifice of those astronauts who lost their lives in this pursuit.
It is critical that we get the funding Congress approved to rebuild more resilient infrastructure after #Harvey. That’s why @RepPeteOlson I our colleagues wrote to OMB asking to finalize the rules and release the funds. Our future depends on
America’s infrastructure was once the envy of the world, but today it is losing its battle against time, growth, and a changing climate. We need to take a bold and new approach that includes tackling these issues head-on and developing real solutions. #TheCostOfInaction
This morning, my colleagues and I on the @TransportDems will be hearing from experts on infrastructure and the urgency to address our nation's necessary repairs and upgrades. You can watch it live here:
Another look at priorities of this fabulous freshman class. So much to work on together, and so much energy to do so.
All the women in white remind me of Ann Richards, when asked what she would have done differently in her term, said, “I would probably have raised more hell.” With more than 100 women in the House, you can be sure we’re taking her advice—and thanking the women who came before us.
To all those in our community who are celebrating, Happy #LunarNewYear! 春节快乐! 恭喜发财！
What a privilege to meet with #TX07 constituents in Washington Houston about issues that matter solutions that might help. Thanks to those who have made time to share their thoughts with me recently on issues that affect our community.
Recognize that chair? My first time there—serving as Speaker Pro Tempore during debate on the House floor—is definitely the highlight of the last week.
@RepPeteOlson @GovAbbott @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz The American people showed up to help us through Congress, directing more than $4 billion to our recovery alone, now we need the money to show up.
Today, @RepPeteOlson and I led @GovAbbott, Senator @JohnCornyn @SenTedCruz, and our Houston colleagues in a letter to the OMB asking them to release the disaster recovery funds we need to rebuild after #Harvey.
RT @HoustonPubMedia: .@RepFletcher wants to use her new seat on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to back @METROHouston…
Today is the birthday of #RosaParks, a woman who faced discrimination with courage and determination, and inspired Americans with her bravery. It is on us all to follow her example to speak out against injustice and fight for equality. We still have work to do.
I'll be live on @HoustonMatters today, so tune in at 12:15PM to 88.7FM (or listen to the show's rebroadcast at 7PM). Looking forward to checking back in with the team at @HoustonPubMedia for the first time since being sworn in!
As we begin to celebrate #BlackHistoryMonth, the @nytimes has published an incredible series of profiles of African Americans who have shaped our history. Their stories are vital to understanding who we are today. See them here:
Glad to have Rhonda Hart as my guest at next week's State of the Union. Her daughter Kimberly was a victim of the shooting at SFHS last year. She fights for gun violence prevention, and I'm proud to bring that fight to Washington.
I'm excited to join my @HouseNewDems colleagues, @RepRonKind, @RepRickLarsen and @RepGregoryMeeks on the Trade Task Force to find common sense solutions to some of our country's most pressing challenges.
Ready to work #forthepeople on some of the most pressing challenges of our time.
Had a great meeting today with Senator @JohnCornyn.  Appreciate the warm welcome to the Texas delegation and the conversation about working together and finding common ground.
The House has passed the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act today, recognizing the much-needed pay raise for the hardworking public servants who deserve our appreciation and respect.
The @Lilly_Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law 10 years ago. Yet a woman is still, on average, paid 80 cents to a man’s dollar. I am proud to join my colleagues in co-sponsoring the #PaycheckFairness Act to close the gap. #EqualPay for equal work.
We have many federal civil servants in our community, more than 3,000 of them working at @NASA_Johnson. As the representative for our community, I want to make sure they are all included and recognized for their valuable work.
Thanks to my colleagues for passing my amendment to the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act to ensure that employees at @NASA are included equally in this bill.
My thoughts are with our brave law enforcement officers who were injured tonight in Houston. Thank you for protecting our community. Houston stands with you.
I’m glad to see the President agree to end the shutdown.  We’ve got a lot of ideas to improve border security, and I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in the House to do so while keeping the government funded and
Thanks for coming to our office, @RepJenniffer. Looking forward to working together!
I loved meeting with the students from Katy who came to Washington with @CloseUp_DC. We talked about what a member of Congress does each day and today's vote to re-open the government.
I represent a district that believes in science, innovation, and facts.  I am honored to serve on a committee that is dedicated to advancing progress in those critical areas
46 years ago today, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling that further recognized the fundamental right to privacy and autonomy that is essential to women’s equality: #RoeVWade. It is essential that we do all we can to protect this right, and I remain committed to doing so.
This week the House will vote to re-open the government for a 10th time. Now it's the Senate's job to take up this bill so we can open the government and address smart border security immigration solutions. We cannot shut down the government in order to govern. #EndtheShutdown
It was wonderful to participate in today’s parade in honor of Dr. King, as Houstonians march in unity and hope. And it is a particular joy to follow Grand Marshall @RepJohnLewis who inspires me every day with his wisdom, his courage, his commitment, his belief in this country.
There is much work to be done.  And we can do it together.  As Dr. King said, “the time is always right to do what is right.”
Today, we remember honor Dr. Martin Luther King for his belief in an America as good as its promise for all Americans, and his courage to make it so. As we reflect on his life, we have the opportunity to reflect on what we can do right now to ensure equality justice for all.
Loved welcoming my first @CloseUp_DC group from #TX07’s Episcopal High School. It brought back memories of my own Close Up trip back in 1991, when I visited my then Congressman who represented what is now part of #TX07.
This is my first year to watch #houmarathon from the finish line.  What a sight!  Congratulations to all the runners — those who crossed this finish line, and all who took on the challenge.  My hat is off to y’all. @HoustonMarathon.
When I lived on University Blvd years ago, the #HouMarathon course went right past my front door.  Glad to be back on University to cheer on the runners.  Thank you Mayor Sample for inviting me to watch from West U City Hall!
Each January, I look forward to waking up early on this day and heading out to cheer on the #houmarathon runners.  I am so inspired by the diverse group of people of all ages who make the commitment to run these 26.2 miles. @HoustonMarathon
It is time to discuss these matters with the seriousness they deserve. Time to #endtheshutdown and get to work #forthepeople.
Democrats have made clear we support smart, effective border security solutions: increased infrastructure investments, advanced technology to scan for contraband, more customs personnel, and more immigration judges.
There is much to discuss on border security matters but this is not the way to do it. We cannot run our government by shutting it down.  And we cannot protect our country by hurting the very people who have made it their life’s work to work for us.
The President’s statement today was truly a disappointment. There was nothing new, and no compromise, just another attempt to pit people in difficult situations against one another. That’s not a solution.
I appreciated the opportunity to hear from local @AFGE leaders in Houston today about the real world impact of this shutdown for those working in our airports, prisons, @NASA_Johnson, elsewhere.  It’s time to #callthevote and #endtheshutdown.
Thank you to @womensmarchHOU organizers and the awesome women who marched to City Hall today.  Amazing energy and commitment to make women’s voices heard.  We will keep making them heard in D.C.
Meeting with @TXDOT was especially useful as I prepare for Committee work with @TransportDems. Bad—but not surprising—news: Texas’ most congested freeway is in #TX07. Good news: They’re working on it!
It is a privilege and a pleasure to represent #TX07 in Congress.  I was delighted to visit with so many constituents in D.C. this week about important issues.
So glad to be a part of this groundbreaking freshman class.
Thank you! Excited and ready to work together on the committee's important work.
Service members and their families sacrifice every day for our freedoms. Today, we remember the four Americans servicemen who were senselessly murdered yesterday in Syria. We are indebted to them and their families for their service and sacrifice.
I joined with my Texas colleagues in a bi-partisan letter expressing our strong opposition to any proposal that would divert disaster relief funds appropriated after Harvey and use them for any other purpose.
This Congress will not allow the President to grant himself extraordinary powers to divert desperately needed funding for relief, recovery, and rebuilding.
I will continue to fight for the additional resources that our region needs to rebuild and restore after Harvey.
All Americans impacted by these natural disasters deserve to know that their government will be with them now and throughout the road to recovery.
Today, I joined my colleagues to pass a $12.4 billion disaster relief bill to provide recovery funds for Americans devastated by hurricanes, wildfires, other disasters, including some for us in Houston as we continue to recover from Harvey.
I am so inspired by my colleagues, and love how this series captures the women of the 116th Congress.  These photos are incredible.   These women are, too.
I want to hear from you about how the shutdown is affecting you.  Share your shutdown story here.
And these are just a few examples of the many heartbreaking stories we are seeing and hearing across the country.  I’m glad they took the time to talk with me.
I spoke with people with cases in court that are now delayed, and justice denied indefinitely.
I talked with TSA agents working hard and without pay – putting their neighbors’ needs ahead of their own.
I met with air traffic controllers in Washington and Houston to hear the impacts this shutdown has on them – now and in the future.
One of the best ways to know how to do that is to hear from you.
But I do.  And I will work with my colleagues to end the shutdown and mitigate the damage in #TX07 and across the country – and we are already working on ways to do that.
The impacts of this shutdown are real, and lasting. And it appears that the Senate and the White House do not care.
There may be reasons, but they are not good reasons.  They are political reasons.  They are partisan reasons.  They are exactly the reasons I and so many others sought to join this Congress and do things differently.
Since then, we have continued to act to re-open government, passing multiple individual Senate Republican appropriations bills to re-open all government agencies. There is no good reason that the Senate has not done the same.
And, to be clear, the new Democratic House passed Senate Republican legislation to end the shutdown, re-open government and secure our borders the day we were sworn in.
The House has passed the legislation to re-open the government.  It is past time for the Senate to do the same.
Today, for the 26th day in a row, they are doing so without pay.  This is unconscionable.
I came to Washington to work #forthepeople, and am grateful for the federal government employees who spend their days working for the people in myriad ways every single day.
At @iah today and grateful for the @TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and others who put the rest of us and our safety first. We must do the same for them. It's time to #EndTheShutdown.
My office is aware of the situation and working to help. I will keep you updated.
As I told the @HoustonChron, the mere suggestion of diverting disaster relief funding is unacceptable. I am working with colleagues across Texas and across the aisle to make sure that doesn’t
It remains the mission of the majority of the House to reopen the government, and we will keep passing legislation this week to do exactly that — and keep working for the people.
On day one of this new Congress, the House passed Republican bills to end the shutdown and reopen government – meeting the needs of the American people, protecting our borders, and respecting our workers.
I came to Congress to work #forthepeople of #TX07 and the United States.
I was honored to join my colleagues for the announcement of #HR1, and appreciate the leadership of @RepSarbanes and @HouseDemocrats in bringing us together on these important reforms.
I am proud to co-sponsor #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, as my first co-sponsored bill in Congress. It is a bold set of reforms to make sure that our government is of, by, and for the people.
Ready to work #forthepeople.
You can find us here
Our doors are open.  Come see us today until 2, or any day, at 1429 Longworth. Y'all are welcome here. #TX07
Honored, grateful, proud to represent #TX07 in the 116th Congress.
