Thanks for having me at the Oklahoma State Habitat Conservation Convention!
On Wednesday, ⁦@housesciencegop⁩ held a vital hearing on “Maintaining United States Leadership in Science Technology”. Decade after decade, the U.S. championed scientific innovation and built upon its foundations of discovery. Here’s to many more scientific breakthroughs!
I was grateful to meet with the Oklahoma VFW this week. We discussed the VA Mission Act, veterans health care, and employment opportunities for those transitioning between service and civilian life. I stand committed to ensuring that our country serves those who once served.
Earlier this week I had the joy of meeting two Oklahoma families advocating on behalf of the ⁦⁦@NDSS⁩ and those with Down Syndrome. I am proud to support those in the Down Syndrome community and their families by supporting legislation such as the #ABLEAct.
Welcome home, #CrewDragon! We look forward to learning all about your mission so that we may once again launch American astronauts on American rockets from American soil.
Today, I took another stand in condemning hatred and racism. There is no place for anti-Semitism, bigotry, or any other racist language in our great society- including in the halls of Congress. We must continue to take a stand and call out racism when we see it.
Congressman Ralph Hall was an exceptional public servant and I was privileged to work with him. As the current Ranking Member, I continue to be inspired by his leadership of the Science Committee. My full comments commemorating the life of a great Texan can be found here:
As told by my @HouseGOP colleagues and Oklahoma’s own @OKelections Secretary, Paul Ziriax, H.R. 1 forces states to adopt “one-size-fits-all” practices which could negatively impact our nation’s election system. Americans deserve strengthened election security, not a rushed bill.
Thank you to @osutulsa's Dr. Raman Singh for testifying about the vital role water plays in our nation's energy production.
Excited to meet with the @okstate Oklahoma Agricultural Leadership Program this morning. Agriculture is one of Oklahoma’s economic drivers- growing more than $7 billion of new crop and livestock each year. With leaders like these, our state will have plenty more good harvests.
Not a single @housesciencegop hearing was held to discuss the election security concerns brought forth by @NIST. Instead, Democrats broke their first promise of providing a more productive and transparent legislative process and rushed the bill to the Floor.
Just as businesses investment in a strong economy, so to must our nation in its sciences. Watch below to hear the discussion on maintaining U.S. leadership in science and technology:
I was proud to meet with a fellow Oklahoman and current @NASA Administrator @JimBridenstine today. As Ranking Member of @housesciencegop, I look forward to working with @NASA pursuing our nation’s missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
As a former county election official, I understand the importance of voter registration election security. #HR1’s “one size fits all” federal approach forces states to adopt burdensome practices. Voters deserve an election system run by their state- not the federal government.
Did You Know: Oklahoma produced 165.9 million barrels of crude oil and was the nation's fourth-largest natural gas-producing state in 2017. Thank you to the @IPAAaccess for sharing the economic successes of our Oklahoman producers.
Investing in research and extension activities at our land-grant universities is vital to our nation’s scientific advancement and economic success. I was delighted to discuss these important issues with the OSU Council for Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching.
@BNSFRailway transports nearly 5 million carloads of Oklahoman products across the United States each year. In 2017, Oklahoma exported $5.4 billion in total exports. Thanks to @BNSFRailway’s investment, Oklahoma’s products will continue to reach domestic international markets.

Earlier this morning I had the pleasure of meeting with student leaders from ⁦@OSUSGASenate⁩ and ⁦@OU_SGA⁩. These young leaders are tackling challenging issues affecting students and I applaud their service to their communities.
Throughout my tenure in Congress I have voted to secure our nation's borders and improve security at our ports of entry. Tonight's vote on H.J.Res. 46 was no different. Read my full statement
It was a pleasure meeting with Oklahoma’s @AmericanLegion Legionnaires and discussing the issues facing our Oklahoma veterans.
Technological innovation plays an important role in scientific research. ARPA-E continues to support fundamental research over a wide range of cutting-edge energy technology areas. Tune in:
Today, the House passed the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act. This pro-growth legislation enhances the @NSF Innovation Corps program. I-Corps helps many start-ups, including many in Oklahoma’s Third Congressional District, utilize the appropriate resources and build a business.
Tonight I spoke on the House Floor to support vital legislation intended to better serve our veterans. The Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act will support and provide opportunities for our veterans as they translate their experiences into meaningful STEM work.
@OSUCASNR students, be sure to apply before March 7! Find the application here ��
As an @FFAOK alumnus, I was proud to support the National FFA Organization’s Federal Charter Act. With the leadership development and agricultural education provided by @NationalFFA, Oklahoma’s future is in good hands thanks to our young leaders.

Oklahoma's REAL ID deadline extended again. Oklahoma now has until October 2019 to become compliant. 
One of the largest responsibilities for Members of Congress is transparency, especially when regulations affect capital and money markets. This why I am urging the House to pass the Federal Reserve Supervision Testimony Clarification Act.
