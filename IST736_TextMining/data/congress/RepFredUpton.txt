One of my big objections to #HR1 is the taxpayer finance campaign element of the bill. We are going to have more money in politics, and we are not going to have the transparency that I think all of us want.That's why today I voted NO.
Good luck to teams competing in the St. Joseph FIRST Robotics District Competition over the next few days. With programs like FIRST, students are exposed to STEM education at an early age. A big thank you to teachers volunteers for helping out! #MI06
Great meeting with Mayor Robert Britigan on behalf of the Institute of Real Estate to discuss issues such as the reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program.
#HR1 is not bipartisan. And one of our big objections is the taxpayer finance campaign element of the bill. Under HR 1, we would have more money in politics, and we are not going to have the transparency that all of us want.

Thanks to my friend @RepDebDingell for the paczki! What a special tradition of John’s to keep going on this #PaczkiDay.
#HR1 would change how you finance elections provides public financing. I’ve always opposed public financing - it just isn't something the federal government ought to pay for.
Grateful for the award from staff students at Three Rivers Health. Thank you for sharing your stories with me yesterday. We’ll continue to advocate for school-based health centers at the federal level - they’re absolutely critical to student success!

When we learned the freezing rain was going to prevent us from being at John Dingell's service today, we all gathered on the plane to praise a good man - a good man who finished strong who really made a mark on American history in a big way.
Had the opportunity to meet with our local Coast Guardsman in St. Joe and to thank them for their dedication and service during the recent government shutdown. They are truly selfless in service and we are forever grateful.
John Dingell was enormous in stature, integrity, and accomplishments. I was always inspired and awed by him.There is a reason a Dingell has always represented SE Michigan for over 80 years.My wife Amey and I express our deepest condolences to his family during this time.
Great meeting with members from the Michigan Rural Water Association to discuss issues facing the water and wastewater industry in #MI06

Pleased to reintroduce the Great Lakes Fishery Research Authorization Act alongside @RepMikeQuigley to ensure we have the data and resources needed to manage a healthy Great Lakes ecosystem and to make sure our fisheries remain a strong economic driver. 
If this is a pivot to bipartisanship, I say it's about time. We can’t build anything if we don’t do it together.  I hope we are truly turning the corner and I welcome the President’s offer to heal divisions and move forward. #SOTU
It was great meeting with @NFBMI last week to discuss legislative options to break down employment barriers for the blind.

Today, I had the opportunity to celebrate the life and legacy of #MLK @LakeMichCollege. As I reflect on Dr. King's words "hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that," I am reminded that we need them now more than ever.

Enough. I voted last night to fund nearly all of the government agencies that have been unnecessarily shuttered since Dec. 22. I will continue working with my colleagues in the House Senate to ensure the gov't is fully funded our border is secure. Much work remains.

21st Century Cures was truly a bipartisan effort from start to finish. Today we can reflect on how far we have come, but it is also a reminder of all the work that remains. Patients and families are counting on us.
Finally, 21st Century Cures has played a pivotal role in addressing the #opioid epidemic by funding the fight at the state level – with more than $1 billion in grants to states in need.
We're also making needed reforms to our mental health system at the FDA. We’re now able to get drugs and devices to the market more efficiently – helping to address drug prices.

I knew President Bush well from my days in the Reagan White House with his office right around the corner. His was among the first congratulatory calls on my first election win, campaigning together in NH, traveling on Air Force One Two. Never a day he let his country down.
The World War II generation often spoke to the rest of us about the character and standing of our nation. President Bush’s passing certainly reminds us what we desire in our leaders: compassion, honesty, trust, grit, a duty to try and do the right thing.
President George H.W. Bush leaves behind a powerful legacy as a war hero, statesman, consummate public servant. Above all else, he was a dedicated family man. A husband, father, grandfather whose faith guided his life in everything he endeavored.
