It's no secret that Northeast Wisconsin continues to deal with water quality and quantity issues. I'm glad to see @UWGB taking steps to help our part of the state meet the growing demand for workers with a water science background.
Instead of reforming Congress and fixing bad process, H.R. 1 goes too far in trying to control what people say and how they vote. Rather than drain the swamp, this bill fills it with billions of taxpayer dollars to be spent on attack ads and overpriced political consultants.

If the Speaker actually wants to show she stands against anti-Semitism, she should bring bipartisan legislation to the floor that would counter the BDS movement and stand with our ally Israel.

Enjoyed meeting with Rear Admiral Joanna Nunan, Commander of @USCGGreatLakes. I look forward to working with her to ensure Wisconsinites can safely enjoy Lake Michigan and all the Great Lakes.
Huawei's work with high-priced DC firms should be a wakeup call. American national security should not be for sale, and the free world must unite in the face of the growing threat of CCP-directed firms and their 5G networks before it's too late.
We can also take steps to strike back at the swamp. This week, I introduced a bill that would prevent former Members of Congress, retired flag and general officers, and former senior executive branch appointees from lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.
Luckily, we can fight back. Earlier this year, @reprubengallego and I introduced bipartisan legislation to hold Chinese telecom firms, like @Huawei, accountable for their malign behavior and cut off their supply of critical US technology.
Huawei's lawsuit is a good example of how the CCP uses the swamp to try to change US policy. It is engaged in an all-out offensive targeted at lawyers, lobbyists, and journalists to save itself and influence our society.
Since @Huawei is "the most open, transparent and scrutinized company in the world," I'm sure it would love to provide a full accounting of the role of its internal Communist Party Committee, as well as a complete roster of CCP members it employs.
Honored to meet with Wisconsin veterans from the VFW. We had a great chat about ways we can better deliver services to our veteran community in Northeast Wisconsin.

From Confucius Institutes to CSSAs, espionage, and cyber security, universities are increasingly on the front lines of competition with China. To prevent more headlines like this, we have to improve cooperation between the government and academia.

Price transparency will increase competition, and competition will help bring down costs. This is why @RepPerlmutter and I introduced new legislation to require healthcare providers to tell you exactly how much their procedures, products and services cost.

We have a wide array of non-military options available. It is time to recommit to the maximum pressure campaign and cut off Kim’s financial lifelines.

ICYMI: Last month I intro’d the "Serve the People, Not the Swamp Act” to:- Prevent Congress from recessing without first passing a budget.- Establish a 5-year lobbying ban for Members of Congress.- End taxpayer-funded pensions for Members of
Why do we have a Congress?
1. It'll likely get tied up in the courts; 2. They didn’t like it when Obama did everything through Executive fiat;3. They'll not like it when a future Democratic president declares a climate emergency to seize airplanes and farting cows. This is bad policy and bad process.
Conservatives celebrating the emergency declaration should pause and consider the following:
This vote also sets the stage for an emergency declaration that will further undermine Congress’s much-diminished capacity for legislating.
And obviously the bill does not solve the border security problem, it merely punts this problem to the 2020 election, meaning the problem will only get worse.
The appropriators released a 1100+ page omnibus bill after midnight today. We suspended (i.e. violated) the rules to vote on it less than 24 hours later with no real deliberation or debate.
Why do we have a Congress?Presumably we have a Congress to deliberate, debate, and legislate. When it comes to border security, Congress has done none of these things.
A top-down approach to policy problems does not work.We shouldn’t be surprised when this process results in a last second vote on legislation that we have little to no time at all to evaluate.
Later tonight we’ll be voting on a 1,159 page bill that we had less than 24 hours to read. This is bad process. And as we’ve learned the hard way, bad process leads to bad policy.Congress must do better.
Great catching up with @WeAreGreenBay on Newsmaker Sunday recently. Check out our conversation on border security, trade policy, and water quality in #WI08.
Today I intro'd new legislation to prevent members from going on CODELs during shutdowns.If we haven’t finished our work of funding the government, then we shouldn’t be going on taxpayer funded trips outside of our districts. This is just common sense.

Like I've said before, until we change the way Congress operates, we’ll be right back where we started: satisfying the literal definition of insanity by doing the same things and expecting different results. At a minimum, we should demand that Congress avoid insanity.
For the first time in five years, the @PortofGreenBay moved more than 2 million tons of cargo in one shipping season. This is awesome news for our local economy in Northeast Wisconsin.

Addressing these cyber vulnerabilities will be neither cheap nor easy which is why today’s @TransportGOP hearing on infrastructure investment was so critical. As we we modernize our infrastructure system, we must ensure its built to withstand rising cyberthreats.
The increasing cybersecurity threat is not just affecting the federal government or large corporations. As I discussed in an op-ed from 2017, American small businesses are the most affected by cybersecurity breaches.
China’s ongoing theft of American IP to benefit Chinese companies costs the US billions each year. In fact, this theft has been deemed “the greatest transfer of wealth in human history,” and one that has surely damaged our economic competitiveness.

Lesson #3 is simple: Problems don’t age well. That’s true in life and particularly true in politics. We can’t punt the problem of border security to the next generation. So let’s work together over these next two weeks with a sense of urgency to fix it.
Until we change the way Congress operates, we’ll be right back where we started: satisfying the literal definition of insanity by doing the same things and expecting different results. At a minimum, we should demand that Congress avoid insanity.
It's no surprise when this process results in a hurried vote on a bill that we had no opportunity to amend. We should instead work from the ground up, starting with the relevant committees ordinary members. This will increase the likelihood of achieving long-lasting policies.
Lesson #2: A top-down approach to policy problems does not work.It seems we routinely let the President and the most powerful members of Congress negotiate in secret, while the rest of us wait for white smoke to emerge from the White House chimney.
In other words, the debate over border security is the best kind of debate to have. It’s not about irreconcilable, abstract principles. It’s about specific requirements that we can measure in terms of geography, human resources and cost.
Perhaps Democrats disagree with this proposal. But assuming everyone agrees on the long-term goal of gaining 100 percent operational control of the border, then the only question is: how do we do it more effectively? What is the right mix of barriers, technology and people?
Lesson #1: There's massive miscommunication on border security that must be cleared up.Despite what you may have heard, the White House is not asking for 1 gigantic concrete wall running coast to coast. Rather, the administration wants a comprehensive package that provides for:

Stopped by the Einstein Expo today, a great event in Green Bay that helps promote STEM education in the community. We’re lucky to have so many incredible resources right here in Northeast Wisconsin to get kids interested in STEM related fields.
Last year, I inserted language into the NDAA to address the growing threat posed by the 1000 Talents program. Glad to see the administration taking action.
US security increasingly depends upon command of the seas. It is not a birthright and is being challenged by China and Russia every day. This is not a 30-year out problem. This is a here and now problem. The Navy the nation needs is the biggest one it can possibly build—now.
As I wrote in @RCDefense last year, maritime superiority is only growing in importance. 355 ships must be a floor, not a ceiling.
Given that the NDS prioritizes the CCP threat and the first island chain is the heart of the competition, abandoning a 355 ship Navy would undermine the entire premise of the NDS and deterrence by denial.
Russia has been in violation of the INF treaty for over a decade. China has never been a party to the agreement and is amassing an enormous missile arsenal. INF is no longer an arms control treaty. It's unilateral disarmament.
Regardless of how you feel about tariffs — whether you think they’re good or bad — I think it's obvious that you should want the People's elected representatives, in the most accountable branch of government, to have greater say in our trade
Last December I had the chance to see the original 1987 INF Treaty at the @Reagan_Library. INF played an important role in the Cold War, but circumstances have changed. I applaud the administration's decision to suspend our obligations under the agreement. It's time to move on.
