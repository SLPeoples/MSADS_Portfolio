Great news!
• $295,399 for COPS School Violence Prevention Prog for the City of BR for officer training, deterrent measures technology to notify law enforcement of emergencies •$134,307 for Project Safe Neighborhood to reduce possession and use of firearms in high-crime neighborhoods.
• $374,798 for COPS School Violence Prevention Program to the Louisiana State Police.  This will allow training for troopers, coordination between school and law enforcement and investment in deterrent technologies.
They are:  $634,971 to the 19th JDC to increase the number of National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN) tech to help connect evidence with guns used in violence crimes.  Ultimately, this will help to solve crimes and bring violent criminals to justice.
This funding is in addition to several million in other federal funds for our peacekeepers.  We are committed to working with our law enforcement partners at every level and with our citizens to rid our streets of violent crime.  This is home.
More good news.  The Dept of Justice has awarded over $1.4 million dollars to the Baton Rouge area to support law enforcement initiatives. These are much-needed resources to help our law enforcement with the tools necessary to keep our communities safe and reduce violent crime.

FEMA awards $18M+ in disaster aid to Ascension, Livingston parish schools
thinking about all the flood victims who are finally going to get the relief they deserve when our duplication of benefits fix gets signed into law...
As we start to take the proactive approach to disasters that this law calls for, American communities will start to be   stronger and safer – and American taxpayers will save money. This new   law is what the rest of the country would simply call, ‘common sense.'
Importantly, this new law will finally enable us to put into practice lessons learned from our 2016 flood, recent hurricanes and other events across the nation.
For two years we fought and fought to fix duplication of benefits for  flood victims – passing it through the House three separate times. That persistence has finally paid off, and our flood victims are going to get the relief they deserve.
Today is a great day for S. Louisiana and for the entire nation. This is one of the most significant disaster recovery and preparedness bills to pass Congress in decades, and we will be a more resilient country because of it.
