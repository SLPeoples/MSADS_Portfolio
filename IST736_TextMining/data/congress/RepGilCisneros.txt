It was great to meet the Paralyzed #Veterans of America @PVA1946 representatives from California this week, looking forward to working with them on their legislative priorities.
Today I met with student vets, like these from @calpolypomona and @csuf to listen to their GI Bill stories and how they effect their lives. We need to help our vets fix the “pay break” problem. Their benefits shouldn’t be cut off when their academic calendars end.
#CA39 Update: Nothing beats taking the mound first thing in the morning. Thank you Hacienda Heights Little League for letting me throw out the first pitch for their #OpeningDay2019
This week our district mourns the death of a girl who was found in Hacienda Heights. Sending my thoughts prayers to her family, her life was taken too soon. Please contact local law enforcement if you have any information to share that could lead to identifying her. #CA39

On #AAPIEqualPay Day, I'm proud to say that I am an original cosponsor of the 2019 #PaycheckFairness Act. Southeast Asian American Pacific Islander women have some of the highest wage disparities. #AAPI women and families can’t afford to wait, we need to end the wage gap.
This week we will be taking action on #HR1 - the #ForThePeople Act. This bill will take steps to ensure access to the ballot box, reign in big money and corporations, as well as tighten ethics rules to hold this Administration accountable.
Behavior like this will not tolerated. We must educate our children on the horrible atrocities fueled by hate in the past make them aware of the violence that that can stem from hate now. I stand with the Jewish community #CA39 in condemning this.

The President's policy on family separation is the real crisis at our Southern Border. This cruel policy needs to end and the families need to be reunited in a timely manner.
With the help of my office, not only is he able to continue being a hard working member of his community, he has now received is green card can continue to support our diverse and vibrant local economy.
My office recently assisted a constituent from Chino Hills with obtaining a 180-day extension for his employment authorization document (EAD). W/O the extension he would have not been able to support his family.

POTUS’s #FakeEmergency makes America less safe by stealing billions from crucial military construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness quality of life necessary to do their jobs effectively.
The #FAIRAct is critical to taking back our justice system. Forced arbitration agreements undermine our indelible Constitutional right to trial by jury, benefiting powerful businesses at the expense of American consumers workers #EndForcedArbitration
It was informative to listen to testimony from our transgender service members and meet a fellow Navy supply officer like me at our @HASCDemocrats hearing. I stand with them, they have right to serve in the U.S. military and they have a right to live as who they are.

Tonight, I voted to end the President's #FakeEmergency at the border. Thank you to Rep. @JoaquinCastrotx for swiftly bringing this resolution to the House floor. We must hold the administration accountable and protect our system of checks balances.
Nearly a year after the DHS began separating children from their parents at the border, we still don’t know the extent damage done to to the well-being of these families. Thank you to the @OversightDems who voted to subpoena the Administration for answers.
Our #PublicLands package is a huge win for conservation the iconic treasures we all love � We’re passing this agreement in the House so we can all keep loving our public lands for generations to come. #LWCF
Heading to the ballot box is a fundamental right. I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act. Congress has the duty to restore protections against racial discrimination in voting. We must #RestoreTheVote
I sent a letter with my colleagues on @HASCDemocrats to the DoD today expressing our concern about the deployment of our military resources and service members at the U.S.-Mexico border. This is a #FakeEmergency with no strategy and it's endangering our national security.
#CA39 Update: We are happy to announce and welcome our newest hire Beto, as our Deputy Doggo Director. Although his brother is in DC heading up the press team, he is ready to make pawisitve change in our community.
I'm with the bipartisan group of former National Security officials in calling the President's national emergency a sham. There is no reason that this #FakeEmergency would entitle the Administration to take away funds important projects across the country.

Climate change is real and the danger to our national security is real. This panel created by the President will ignore our DoD and Intelligence communities by giving climate deniers a platform to spread falsehoods on this threat.
#Onthisday Executive Order 9066 was signed during World War II and our country wrongfully forced the internment of tens of thousands of Japanese-Americans. We must never again allow fear to compromise our values and dictate our actions at the cost of civil liberties.

Today, the President overstepped his constitutional authority to declare a #FAKENationalEmergency at our southern border. Diverting funds from our military, disaster-aid, and infrastructure projects is unacceptable and needs to be challenged.
Proud to join @RepCicilline of the @HouseGVP in cosponsoring his legislation to ban assault weapons. As a Navy Veteran, I understand that these weapons of war should not be easily accessible and this bill will ensure less are out there.

Using emergency funds to build a wall at the expense of disaster relief-aid harms families does not reflect our values. The President's need for a border wall is not a national emergency. The real crisis is the urgent need for humane immigration reform.

For 35 days, the President held hundreds of thousands of workers’ paychecks, health, and well-being hostage. Now he's said that shutting down the government for a 2nd time is “certainly an option.” No. It's not.
Proud to join @RepRaskin as we work to enact real campaign finance reform and get government working #ForThePeople

We need to #RenewDACA now. Deporting our DREAMers will be disastrous for our communities, economy and the nation. They simply want the opportunity to live and contribute to the country they grew up in and love.

Today I voted in favor of the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act. I believe that public servants – both civilian and military – deserve better than the shutdowns, furloughs, and pay freezes forced on them.
I’m proud to support the #PaycheckFairness Act, because #EqualPay is crucial to building a stronger economy and empowering women to break the glass ceiling.

Today is the 10th anniversary of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, but we still must fight to close the gender wage gap. Women are the backbone of our communities and it's why I support #equalpay for equal work and the #paycheckfairness act.
The President's tax cuts of $1.5 billion = little to no economic impact. We need to do more to grow our middle-class and reduce income inequality, instead of giving more breaks to the corporations and the most wealthy.
ICYMI: I participated in my first @HASCDemocrats hearing, read my press release and watch my remarks here.
I joined @RepHoulahan and my colleagues in cosponsoring the #SEASAct to help ensure there are #NoMoreShutdowns
The shut down underscored the importance services our public servants provide to all Americans. We need to stop holding government workers' paychecks hostage and fairly compensate them.
Tune in to watch my first @HASCDemocrats full committee hearing on the use of military resources at the US-Mexico Border. Watch my line of questions and testimony live here.
Another unintended consequence of the government shut down was the added stress on our already backlogged immigration system. We don't need a wall, we need common sense immigration reform.
Businesses and federal workers are still reeling from the government shut down. The CBO estimates there was $3 billion in lost economic activity. Unacceptable. We need to maintain our efforts to finding legislative solutions to reduce this uncertainty.
#CA39 Update: This weekend Team Cisneros recognized the amazing work being done by volunteers at the Diamond Bar Friends of the Library Appreciation Dinner. Congrats to all your hard work and dedication.
#CA39 Update: The shutdown highlighted that many Americans don't agree with a senseless border wall. But we do need to address immigration reform. I met with @SEIU members today to discuss DACA, TPS creating common sense pathways to citizenship.

It is important that we put partisanship aside do our jobs for the American people. I hope we can now move forward work together on real, sensible solutions to keep our borders secure and our communities safe.
Not to mention the long-term damage the President has done to our economy.@HouseDemocrats voted 11 times on 10 separate bills to reopen the government each time we faced opposition from Senate Republicans.
This past month our federal employees and their families were put in a situation they did not deserve. I'm glad the President has agreed to re-open the government, but disappointed that it took him 35 days. All the while American families were unfairly used as bargaining chips.
#CA39 Update: Today I visited the OC Veterans Service Center and met with Chairman Bobby MacDonald and Eric Ensley. I look forward to working closely with the center to ensure our veterans are taken care of.
Today is day 35 of the President's shut down our public servants aren’t “sacrificing,” they are being held hostage. Many are missing their second paychecks today. It’s past time to end this. #EndtheShutdown
ICYMI: Today I made my first floor speech on how my constituents are being hurt by the President's #Shutdown . Enough is enough.
At 12:30 PM PST I'll speak for the 1st time on the House floor to share stories of how the President's shutdown is hurting the people of #CA39. You can hear me share their stories at the link:
@RepDeanPhillips @dog_rates @HouseDemocrats Nice doggo @RepDeanPhillips. Our Press Pup Booster is also pretty busy helping us make puppy pitches. @HouseDemocrats
Today I was gaveled into my 1st committee meeting w/ @HASCDemocrats. Honored to be serving on the Seapower and Protection Force Military Personnel subcommittees. I promise to provide insight into how our military is run how to best serve our service members.
I joined @HouseDemocrats to vote for the 11th time on bipartisan legislation to reopen the goverment and #EndTheShutdown. It's time the President and @senatemajldr stop holding the federal government hostage, the lives of our federal employees are not bargaining chips.
Instead of ending this #shutdown POTUS continues to demand his useless border wall. @HouseDemocrats are taking concrete actions to invest in smart effective border security, but the Senate Majority Leader refuses to do his job and take up the bipartisan legislation.
I am honored to be joining the @HouseNewDems under @RepDerekKilmer leadership. I am committed to bringing #CA39's voice to promote economic growth fiscally responsible legislation.
Air quality in the US has improved dramatically over the past several decades thanks to the #CleanAirAct, but our environmemt faces daily threats by the Trump admin. We must fight to ensure #HealthyAirForAll, especially underserved comunities of color.
The President said he was "proud to shut down the government." The pay of the men and women of federal law enforcement our homeland security community, incl the Coast Guard, FBI, DEA should not be used as a negotiating tactic. Period. #EndTheShutdown

Today marks the 46th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Yet we still have politicians that believe they have the authority to regulate what happens between a woman her doctor. We must continue to stand up for women' s healthcare rights protect #RoeVWade.
This #shutdown has gone on for 32 days. On day 1, Democrats voted to re-open the government with a bill that unanimously passed the Senate last year. It's on POTUS to act on bipartisan legislation and stop holding our federal employees hostage.
We must move to #renewDACA immediately. DREAMers are students, teachers, service members, and community members. We owe them permanent
The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the President's transgender troop ban is a discredit to their service and harms our national security. We need to stand against hate and protect the rights of our transgender service members.
It's with great pride excitement to announce that our 1st district office will be open in a few weeks in Fullerton. We are thankful for your patience during this transition period. My team I are busy ensuring we are equipped to deliver the best constituent services possible.
#CA39 Update: Glad I was also able to meet with @cityofbrea Mayor Christine Marick City Manager Bill Gallardo. It's important to me that my team I establish relationships with all the cities to ensure that the district's voices are heard in DC.
It was also great meeting with Supervisor Doug Chaffee at the Pickled Monk where I met one of my constituents Jose, who became a citizen in October and casted his first vote for me in November.
#CA39 Update: Thank you @FullertonCA City Manager Ken Domer and Mayor Jesus Silva for meeting with me today. I look forward to working together to tackle homelessness and public safety.
Citizens United was decided 9 years ago today. It's time to end corruption in our government why I've cosponsored #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act – our plan for transparency, voter empowerment, election protection campaign finance reform.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. carried a message of hope, equality justice. As his legacy lives on, let us not forget that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. #MLKDay
I want to thank @OCYD for having me on their diversity panel today. #CA39 is one the most diverse districts in the country. I truly believe our society is stronger when we promote diversity. We all have a responsibility to foster encourage the next great diverse leaders.
The President is the one who shut down the government, tried to end DACA, and has put TPS in limbo. He should stop playing political games with people's lives and sign the bipartisan legislation Democrats passed on the first day of this new Congress to open the government.
#CA39 Update: It was great marching alongside everyone morning at @OCWomensMarch. We must continue the fight.
Tomorrow I will march in solidarity at the @OCWomensMarch. I hope to see you all there to celebrate the record breaking election of women leaders across the county and continue the fight for women's rights and equality.
#CA39 Update: Today I met with @Chino_Hills City Council members, @councilchick Vice Mayor to discuss the needs of our consituents. I look forward to working closely with them to ensure we invest in transportation and community development.
