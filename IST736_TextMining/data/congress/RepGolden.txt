From bait shortages to clunky regulations, there’s no doubt Maine’s fishing industry faces challenges. At the Maine Fishermen’s Forum in Rockland, I talked with Maine fishermen about how we can work together to confront these issues and protect good Maine jobs in our fisheries.
My healthcare roadmap includes measures to boost Medicaid expansion, allow Mainers 50+ to buy into Medicare, and reduce drug costs as we move towards universal coverage and #MedicareforAll.More info here:
Healthcare and rising drug costs were top of folks’ minds at the town hall in Fort Kent last week. We discussed some of the ideas in my healthcare roadmap.

I introduced my first bill last month, which will deliver results for Hancock County and for Maine.Last week, we passed our bill through the House and sent it to the president to become law.
It’s always great to be up in the County, but Can-Am Crown weekend in Fort Kent is something special. I met Mainers from all over the state, cheered on the mushers, and hopped on a sled!
While we were up in the County this weekend, I joined @sentroyjackson for a Town Hall in Ft. Kent.Thanks to @ryanfecteau, @mattmoonen, and Rep. John Martin for participating as well! #mepolitics
I met Retired Army Sgt. Christy Gardner and Tiny Tim when they visited Leeds Central Elementary last month. It was great to get to know Christy. She's a leader and an inspiration to young students and all of us here in
It’s a beautiful day in the St.John Valley! We’re at the 27th Annual Can-Am Crown today.I got to meet Amy, a Madawaska musher competing in the Irving Woodlands 250mi competition. I hopped on her sled for the first few hundred yards.
Next stop: the County!We’ll be joining @SenTroyJackson for his town hall in Fort Kent tonight. And tomorrow, we’ll be cheering on the mushers and meeting Mainers at the legendary Can-Am Crown Sled Dog Race!
Last month, we introduced the Young Fishermen’s Development Act to help prepare the next generation of Maine fishermen.Our bill helps programs like Eastern Maine Skippers serve even more students and continue the great work we saw at the forum today.
One of the highlights was talking with students in the @mccfisheries’ Eastern Maine Skippers Program, which prepares students for careers in our fishing industry.The students presented projects that use technology to help Maine fishermen. They knocked it out of the park!
We were in Rockland this morning at the #MaineFishermensForum to learn from the hardworking folks in Maine’s fishing industry. We met Mainers with the Lobstermen’s Association, @NOAAFish_GARFO, and many other groups.
Thanks to everyone who came out for our open house in Bangor last weekend!
#MedicareforAll will ensure ever Mainer and every American has affordable healthcare, because an equal chance at a healthy life should be a right, not a privilege. Every other developed nation in the world has a universal healthcare system. We can do it too. 9/
Almost 30 million Americans are uninsured. 40 million more can’t afford their insurance. There’s no doubt our system is broken, so let’s fix it. Change won't happen overnight, but pushing for #MedicareforAll is the right thing to do and the right direction for our country 8/
Even with these changes, our current healthcare system can't guarantee every Mainer quality healthcare they can afford. We have to be bold change the system to get universal coverage in America. That’s why I’m cosponsoring #MedicareforAll as part of my healthcare roadmap. 7/
But we also need to start thinking bigger on healthcare. Our roadmap includes a plan to allow Mainers over 50 to buy into Medicare. The bill would provide 145K people in our state with affordable, quality healthcare coverage. That's a big deal for an older state like Maine. 6/
I’ve been outspoken about skyrocketing Rx drug costs. My roadmap includes: Preventing abusive Rx price spikes Permitting Americans to import safe cheap Canadian Rx Allowing Medicare to negotiate lower Rx prices Changing NAFTA to promote generic Rx competition 5/
Mainers took a critical step by voting to expand Medicaid. Now I’m pushing to give our state the same access to Medicaid funding that other states received. That’s a critical piece to the roadmap 4/
We need to take action right now to help Maine people facing crushing healthcare costs. My plan focuses on progress we can make right now, like protecting patients with pre-existing conditions. 3/
Today I’m sharing my plan to make quality, affordable care available to all Maine people. We’re calling it a healthcare roadmap. 2/#mepolitics
THREAD: More than any other issue, Maine people tell me how they struggle to afford healthcare. We’re facing sky-high medical bills while insurance companies Big Pharma profit. We can do better. 1/#mepolitics
Too many Mainers struggle with the high cost of healthcare. We met with a group of ME doctors last week to discuss how we can make care more affordable, especially in rural communities. Maximizing Medicaid expansion working to lower RX drug costs are two good places to start.
We joined Maine seniors in Lewiston last week to listen to folks answer questions on making healthcare more affordable, the rising cost of Rx drugs, much more.@AARPMaine hosts coffees like this all the time! More info here:
Great to join Jennifer Rooks and @MaineCalling for a good conversation about getting money out of politics, protecting VA care, what a good trade deal should focus on, and lots of other issues. Thanks to all the Mainers who called in!

The Trump Administration should be working to expand access to healthcare, not block it. With their new rule on Title X funding, the administration places itself squarely between important preventative healthcare services and thousands of Maine women and families who need care.
We met with @OurTownBelfast this week to discuss the role of local small businesses in their Main Street program and learn more about their great work to grow historic downtown Belfast.

We visited the Twin Rivers mill in Madawaska yesterday, met with leadership, and talked with workers on the floor. I'm focused on protecting good jobs like these, especially in Maine's rural areas.
We introduced our FLAT Prices Act last week. It says that if a Rx company spikes drug prices by an unreasonable amount they more quickly lose their monopoly on that drug, helping lower costs and protect Maine people from price spikes on the drugs they need.Via @NewsCenterMaine
We were all over Farmington and Wilton last weekend! We had a great time at the Farmington Children's Festival, met the folks at @puremainemaple, and learned from local businesses. It's always good to be up in Franklin County.
We stopped by Jarden Plastic Solutions in Wilton on Saturday. They provide 100s of good-paying Maine jobs by focusing on quality efficiency.We're learning from Maine manufacturers so we can improve our trade policies prioritize American workers and American-made products
I'm holding office hours at our Caribou office this morning, having coffee and talking with folks. If you’re in the area, swing by! We’ll be here for another hour or so.
Most days in Congress are a whirlwind, but there are good moments. This was one of them. Last week, I signed the FLAT Prices Act before introducing it in the House. Our bill will help stop Big Pharma from jacking up drug prices on working people that need affordable medicines.

The president is wrong to use his authority to declare a nat'l emergency. The sky isn't falling and most Americans don’t buy his rhetoric. Instead, we should fix our immigration system and strengthen our borders with bipartisan deals like the compromise bill we'll pass today 2/

Thanks to @RepCasten, @RepSlotkin, @RepGilCisneros, @RepMaxRose, and @chelliepingree for joining me to introduce the FLAT Prices Act in the House. @SenatorDurbin, a long-time leader on fair Rx drug costs, introduced the bill in the Senate. I'm proud to join him in this effort.
We need common-sense solutions to lower healthcare costs. Addressing the rising cost of Rx drugs is a step we can take right now. Today, I introduced the FLAT Prices Act to help prevent abusive drug companies from jacking up drug prices on the American people. #mepolitics
How do corporations get away with this? When they develop a new drug, the gov’t gives Rx companies a years-long monopoly. They can skyrocket prices with no competition. It’s a system intended to promote but many pharma companies abuse it on the backs of Maine people.
Rx drug prices have been out of control for years, but in 2016 we saw just how abusive drug companies had become. In the space of 9 years, amid record profits, Mylan shot its prices for the life-saving allergy drug Epipen up by 400%
Higher Rx drug prices are one of the biggest drivers of rising healthcare costs. Maine people spend at least twice as much on prescription drugs as we did thirty years ago. Democrats, Republicans, and everyone in between agrees: this is a problem we need to fix it.
I met with the Maine Medical Association to discuss how we can make healthcare more affordable for Maine people. One thing I brought up: the cost of prescription drugs. Year after year, Mainers get soaked by high drug prices. It's past time our country addressed this issue.
We visited Lost Valley to meet local veterans and support a great cause. Vets in the Valley offered veterans their families a free day on the slopes and connected them with resources like the Lewiston Vets Center, the Maine Bureau of Veterans Services, and the Career Center.
Coffee, breakfast, and constituents at Rolly’s Diner in Auburn this weekend. We talked with whoever wanted to chat, asked them what was on their minds, and discussed how I can help. Thanks to former state Senator John Patrick for joining us!
I visited the Downeast Institute in Beals learned more about their work to keep our shellfish fisheries healthy sustainable. Their work is crucial, since 1000s of good Maine jobs - and a big part of Maine's heritage - depend on these fisheries thriving far into the future.
Maine’s one of our most rural states. #ChildCare4Vets needs to work as well in rural areas as it does in cities.My 2nd amendment reports on the program's effectiveness and accessibility in rural areas. We'll use the info to improve the program so it works for rural veterans. 4/

We passed #ChildCare4Vets to provide no-cost childcare to veterans seeking mental health care at the VA.I know first-hand how important it is for veterans to have access to mental health services. Our bill helps my fellow vets get the care they need.

Great to be in my old elementary school classroom in Leeds Monday, where I got grilled by some constituents with tough questions like:- What's your favorite �? (Border Collie/Aus Shepherd mix)- What do your parents do? (run a small biz)- Did you go snowshoeing for PE? (yep!)
Maine’s older more rural than most of the country, which makes it hard for many Maine people to access affordable healthcare. We rode along with Androscoggin Home Healthcare Hospice to learn how we can help them provide quality, affordable care to Maine seniors others.
Heidi Gerding’s small biz took a $100,000+ hit from the gov't shutdown. Losses that big would cripple some family businesses in Maine.In @HouseSmallBiz today, we focused on helping small biz who haven’t recovered from the shutdown. Watch more here:

Heading into tonight's #SOTU2019, I was looking for areas where I could work with the president to get things done for Maine people. Here's what I took from the speech: #MEpolitics
We’re hearing the president will call for both parties to put aside their differences come together. I welcome that message, but he has to back it up with leadership. We need to see concrete proposals from @POTUS and willingness to work with both parties to get this done 11/
That’s why Maine needs strong federal funding to build infrastructure that grows our economy, creates good jobs, connects our businesses and homes. I’ll be listening for @POTUS to seize the moment, work across the aisle, and outline a real infrastructure plan. #mepolitics 10/
Here’s the thing: Maine isn’t NY or CA and we’re more than 90% small biz. An infrastructure plan that requires private investment and lots of state and local gov’t $$$ won’t work here. #mepolitics 9/
Investing in infrastructure is huge for #ME02. We’re 1 of the most rural districts in the US, we’re the biggest east of the Mississippi. Bad roads, bridges, rail, poor broadband internet access quite literally hold our families, workers, businesses back. #mepolitics 8/
Here’s another area where I want to work with the president: INFRASTRUCTURE. There’s a real opportunity here for both parties to work together with @POTUS and get something done for Mainers. Few states would benefit more from better roads, bridges, etc than Maine. #mepolitics 7/
I’ll work with @POTUS when his policies help Mainers, but I’ll fight back when his policies hurt our state. I’ll work with the president to overhaul NAFTA if he's serious about protecting Maine jobs, but this deal comes up short. 6/ #mepolitics #replaceNAFTA
.@POTUS' NAFTA 2.0 must be changed to do more to keep good jobs in Maine and increase wages. And trade deals aren’t worth the paper they’re written on if other countries don’t play by the rules, so we need stronger enforcement provisions. #mepolitics 5/
The president’s NAFTA 2.0 proposal appears to be more of the same. It looks like a new paint job on the old NAFTA, not the meaningful change we need. Too many Maine communities know where this path leads: closed mills, outsourcing, and low wage jobs. #mepolitics 4/
One thing Cynthia I have been talking about: the president's #NAFTA plans. We agree with @POTUS that NAFTA's a bad deal for American workers.NAFTA's been a disaster for Maine's working folks. It needs a full overhaul that addresses the agreement’s root problems #mepolitics 3/
