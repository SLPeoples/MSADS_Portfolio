#HR1 hijacks our election process and promotes voter fraud.  We cannot condone voter disenfranchisement. Fraudulent voters dilute real voters. I firmly stand against the Democrats efforts to rig elections.
#HR1 weakens our voting system fails to implement the necessary checks balances. This legislation does NOTHING to crack down on illegal aliens voting in our elections. In order to uphold our the integrity of our elections we must crackdown on voter fraud.  #NOTforthePeopleAct
Without naming the offender, the chastisement is an empty gesture. I voted “no” to the watered down resolution. It’s time for Democrats to take real action against these anti -Jewish remarks.
Imagine the possibilities when we put the patient first and demand that health insurance companies compete for their business.
Great to see Bullhead City Mayor Tom Brady today! Our land exchange we worked on together, H.R. 755, is now expected to be signed into law next week as part of the lands package.
Patients, doctors, and hospitals all benefit when health insurers compete to provide a variety of quality coverage options. Competition empowers people to create new ideas.
