Spoke on the House floor this afternoon calling for passage of the amendment I introduced with @RepPressley that would lower the #voting age to 16. Our measure is part of #HR1. Time to ensure that the voices of our country’s young people are heard at the ballot box!
I’m committed to making sure we empower young people to build our future together. Giving them the power to vote will help build a more equitable and just future. I urge my colleagues to include the Meng/Pressley amendment to lower the voting age to 16 in #HR1! #ForthePeople 2/2
Tonight I’m testifying before @RulesDemocrats to argue why it is important to lower the voting age to 16 with @RepPressley! Our young people can work and pay taxes. Let’s also make sure they can make their voices heard by voting in all elections. 1/2
Wonderful time visiting local schools this week and last week. Took part in Career Day today at M.S. 158 and read Dr. Seuss books to students at P.S. 162 on Friday during celebration of Dr. Seuss Day. Both schools are located in #Bayside. #Queens
AAPI women work over 2 extra months to earn what a Caucasian male earns in a year. Disaggregated data shows that SE Asian Pacific Islander women have some of the highest wage gaps. Let’s close the wage gap pass the Paycheck Fairness Act. #AAPIEqualPay #NotYourModelMinority
Disgusted over the reported treatment of Adnan Asif Parveen. Despite having a legal work permit, Mr. Parveen–who is a #Muslim–was detained by CBP officers given only pork to eat. Urging @DHSgov Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to investigate. @RoqPlanas
Good meeting with Queens College President and @CUNY Chancellor-designate Félix Matos Rodríguez. Discussed Queens College’s STEM education program and other issues affecting students. Also wished him a happy birthday which is today.

Proud to support resolution that would end @RealDonaldTrump’s #FakeTrumpEmergency. Look forward to voting for it. #POTUS may try to subvert the U.S. Constitution, but Article I is clear: “ALL legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the US.” #FactsMatter
Honored to celebrate the opening of the #OneFlushing building that will offer affordable housing units, social service center retail space for #Queens businesses! Thank you @AAFE1974, HANAC, Monadnock Development for your vision dedication to enriching our neighborhood.
Today, @realDonaldTrump singled out @NYTimes as the ‘true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE.’ His fearmongering is unwarranted and does nothing to strengthen our nation. A free press is a key pillar of a healthy democracy. Attacks on it are harmful and dangerous. #POTUS must stop.
Honored to meet Harper and her mother, Tracy, on their #GirlBossTour. I’m proud to have shared my story and hope it will inspire Harper in the years to come.

Congress has a responsibility duty to combat gun violence in the US. In any given year, over 120K Americans are shot. Over 17K children teens are injured or killed from gun violence each year. This is unacceptable must stop. We need #ActionOnGunViolence! #EnoughIsEnough
But I will not stand for attacks on hardworking middle class families, immigrant communities, and young people, and I will continue to fight against any proposals or policies that seek to harm them.  My full statement here: #SOTU 2/2

The #TrumpShutdown cost our economy $11 billion, with $3 billion permanently lost. It devastated federal workers negatively impacted the American people. It’s unconscionable that @RealDonaldTrump is already threatening a 2nd shutdown if he doesn’t get his border wall.
Honored to take part in recent Eagle Scout Court of Honor ceremony held by #BoyScout Troop 49 in #Bayside.
"Never again” should not be a slogan we say lightly once a year, but must define our policy toward combating anti-Semitism and protecting vulnerable populations all over the world from genocide. My full statement below on  #HolocaustRemembranceDay.
@alisabaremboym @realDonaldTrump Stay tuned!
For 35 days, @RealDonaldTrump, Senate Majority Leader McConnell, House Republicans have refused to work with Democrats to reopen the government. I am hopeful that both sides will secure a long-term spending bill that funds the government without border wall funding.
Completely unacceptable! Mr. President, I call on you once again to reopen the government. #TrumpShutdown
I once again urge the President to end this reckless shutdown. Continuing to hold federal workers hostage and harm our economy and the American people is unacceptable. Mr. President, reopen the gov’t!  #TrumpShutdown 2/2
.@HouseDemocrats have voted 11 times to reopen the gov't. Democrats support border security funding continue to negotiate in good faith. @RealDonaldTrump’s demand for a $5.7 billion wall in exchange for ending the gov’t shutdown continues to do great harm to our nation. 1/2
Great spending time with @RepJeffries and Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House Minority Leader who visited Capitol Hill this afternoon. She has been working hard to expand voting rights, build coalitions and bring together communities of color.
Great time visiting with local students yesterday at the P4 school in #FreshMeadows.
Disappointed with #SCOTUS’ decision to allow @RealDonaldTrump’s #TransMilitaryBan to take effect. Transgender Americans have bravely served our nation help keep our country safe. I will continue to oppose the administration’s discriminatory policies.
The life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. inspires us to this day! As we honor his memory, let’s recommit ourselves to embracing the legacy he left behind, and continuing his fight for equality for all. “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” #MLKDay
The President is using #DREAMers #TPS recipients as political pawns while trying to put taxpayers on the hook for a $5.7 billion wall he promised Mexico would pay for. Unacceptable! It’s now day 29 of the #TrumpShutdown. Enough is enough. @realDonaldTrump must reopen the gov’t.
The reckless #TrumpShutdown continues to harm government workers, our economy and the American people. With the President’s shutdown dragging on, I’ve put together the following guide that answers many questions on how you may be impacted:
Thanks to @BrianLehrer for having me on his show on @WNYC. Talked about my legislation to stop @RealDonaldTrump from declaring a national emergency for his border wall during the shutdown. Also discussed my voting rights legislation other issues.
My full statement commending Judge Furman’s decision to reject the administration’s census citizenship question: #2020Census
A federal court blocks @RealDonaldTrump’s administration from adding a citizenship question on the #2020Census! As a member of Congress who has led the charge against the question, I applaud this ruling. It’s the right decision and will help ensure a more accurate census count.
Moving tribute at memorial service for Don Capalbi, my longtime staff member and a #Queens civic leader who passed away in December. Thanks to all the people – including the many community leaders – who came out to remember his years of service and dedication to our district.

UPDATE: I have officially introduced the "No Walls Act" to stop @RealDonaldTrump from declaring a national emergency for his border wall during the shutdown. Thanks to cosponsors @RepLoisFrankel  @NydiaVelazquez @RepGonzalez @RepJayapal @RepAnnieKuster. #TrumpShutdown #NoWall
I'll be introducing a bill to stop @RealDonaldTrump from declaring a national emergency for his border wall. The President can’t just refuse to fund the gov't, say “EMERGENCY!” get whatever political wish he desires. Not how the Constitution works.
My next @DeptVetAffairs office hours will be on January 23rd. If you're a local #veteran or beneficiary that would like to meet with a representative from the VA, I encourage you to contact my office to make an appointment. Please call 718-358-MENG (6364) by January 16th.

Glad to see progress in efforts to combat mailbox fishing in NE #Queens. After I called on @USPS to replace all borough collection boxes w/ new anti-theft boxes, the agency agreed to do so. Thanks to USPS, @NYPD111Pct @USPISpressroom for all their work.
Tonight, @RealDonaldTrump told the American people why we need a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Because of Pres. Trump, over 800,000 federal employees are working without pay or furloughed without pay. This is wrong the government shutdown must end!
House Democrats are introducing legislation today to expand background checks on gun sales as we mark the 8th anniversary of the Tucson, Arizona shooting that killed 6 wounded 13, including former Rep. @GabbyGiffords. Time for Congress to finally take action #EndGunViolence!
I applaud @NYCMayor for his plan to guarantee health care to all #NYC residents. Health care is a human right! Everybody deserves access to reliable and quality medical care and this initiative will ensure that all New Yorkers receive the coverage they deserve.
The #TrumpShutdown enters its 3rd week, forcing thousands of civil servants to continue working without pay or be furloughed without pay. Over 14k federal employees their families in #NY are suffering from this irresponsible shutdown. @RealDonaldTrump must reopen the gov’t!
American families, businesses communities continue to be hurt from the effects of the #TrumpShutdown. The new Democratic-led House voted to reopen the gov't but @RealDonaldTrump continues to play politics with people’s lives. The President’s reckless shutdown must end now!
The women of New York City’s Congressional delegation! Excited to be working with these awesome colleagues. @RepMaloney @AOC @NydiaVelazquez @RepYvetteClarke #NYC

The government shutdown is an embarrassment and shame on @RealDonaldTrump and House Republicans for allowing it to happen. We must fund the federal government for the American people.
I’ve sent a letter to the head of the Federal Bureau of Prisons calling for clear guidance on the agency’s distribution of feminine hygiene products to incarcerated women. #MenstruationMatters
Today is the 6th anniversary of the tragic shooting at #SandyHook Elementary School that resulted in the loss of 26 innocent lives to gun violence. Parents should not have to worry about the safety of their children at school. Let’s recommit ourselves to ending gun violence.
As a parent of young kids, I'm heartbroken over the death of this 7-year-old. This shouldn’t have happened Customs Border Protection must conduct a thorough investigation. @RealDonaldTrump’s cruel immigration policies continue to devastate families.
Reminder that tomorrow (Saturday, December 15th) is the deadline for New Yorkers to enroll in a health insurance plan for coverage beginning on January 1st. To sign up, go to Don’t miss your chance to #GetCovered for the coming year!
Today is the 3rd anniversary of the #ParisAgreement. @RealDonaldTrump’s decision to abandon this deal and roll back critical environmental protections are detrimental to a cleaner future for our nation. We must fight climate change! #ActOnClimate
Jan 2017 Trump signed exec order for new border security personnel. Private contractor awarded $297 million for 7500 hires over 5 years. In 10 months spent $13.6 million and hired TWO people. Massive FAIL. Read my letter to Sec. Nielsen and DHS IG alert.
Great to join seniors this week for the #Hanukkah celebration at the @SelfhelpNY Austin Street Senior Center in #ForestHills. #Queens
Asked @DHSgov to withdraw proposed public charge rule that would deny green cards to immigrants who lawfully use public benefits. No adequate rationale from #DHS, as required by law, to justify the harm this proposal does to families.
Sad to announce the death of Don Capalbi, my longtime community liaison who was also the head of the Queensboro Hill Flushing Civic Assn. He was a great human being who worked tirelessly for the people of our Congressional district will be sorely missed!

Today, @RepDavidEPrice, @JoaquinCastrotx and I sent a letter to @RealDonaldTrump informing him that his “Remain in Mexico” policy for #asylum seekers is not only wrong, it’s contrary to U.S. and international law.
The first meeting of Democrats in the New York delegation for the upcoming 116th session of Congress. Welcome to our new members! Looking forward to getting down to work with my current and soon-to-be colleagues in January.

Pleased that Judge Jon S. Tigar temporarily blocked @RealDonaldTrump’s cruel policy to deny #asylum to migrants who don’t cross through checkpoints at the U.S. border. Just because you don’t like the law doesn’t mean you get to change it on a whim.
Wonderful time addressing the #ForestHills Civic Association during the group’s meeting tonight. Provided an update from Washington and spoke about my initiatives in Congress. #Queens
Always an honor to congratulate new Eagle Scouts from #Queens. Proud to do so today during Court of Honor ceremony held by #BoyScout Troop 49 in #Bayside.

Appalled by @RealDonaldTrump’s threat to end #birthrightcitizenship. #POTUS can’t just throw out the 14th Amendment because he doesn’t like it. This is just another tactic that is part of his larger anti-immigrant agenda.
We must all speak out against these heinous acts and do everything possible to combat hate in whatever form in takes. Please keep the victims, their families and the entire Tree of Life congregation in your thoughts and prayers. 2/2

Joining @NYCMayor, @QueensBPKatz, @CMPeterKoo to unveil new designs for memorial at the Olde Towne of #Flushing Burial Ground. The spot is the final resting place of African Native Americans from the 1800s. The project will include a wall listing those who are buried here. 1/2
Honored to receive the Champion of #SmallBusiness Investing Award from the Small Business Investor Alliance (SBIA). The award recognizes my support for small businesses and their access to capital.
Deeply opposed to the Trump Admin’s proposal to roll back the rights of the transgender community. I stand in solidarity with over 1.4 million transgender Americans who only want to live as their authentic selves. #TransRightsAreHumanRights #WontBeErased
These attempted attacks are despicable and must be condemned by all. Glad there have been no injuries and I thank our brave law enforcement officers for their swift response. Will continue to monitor developments.
Saluting the work of the @QueensLibrary and the services and resources it provides to our borough during the Library's 2018 gala last night in #Queens.
Proud to have passed several important measures into law that will assist our #veterans. We must ensure that our veterans have the care and resources they need and deserve, and caring for our veterans’ wellbeing will always be a top priority of mine.
Critical for a probe of Secretary Ross to move forward. We must have a full accounting of what happened regarding his decision to add a citizenship question. #2020Census. 3/3
Secretary Ross must be held accountable for not telling the truth to Congress. Last week, I urged Attorney General Jeff Sessions to investigate Ross and now I’m calling on Sessions to recuse himself due to comments that reflect his bias on the issue. #2020Census. 2/3
Terrible decision by #SCOTUS that for now will shield @SecretaryRoss from answering questions about adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census. During a hearing, the Secretary lied to me about the origins of including the question on the Census. 1/3
Nice time touring the Ironworkers apprentice training facility in #Queens. The facility is run by Locals 40 and 361. Learned about the union’s training programs and upcoming projects, and discussed worker safety and other issues.
On the campus of Queens College this afternoon for the 36th annual #Korean Harvest Festival which promotes Korean culture, music and food here in our borough.
Recently visited with pharmacists at the @StopandShop in Maspeth which serves #Maspeth and #Elmhurst. Toured the pharmacy and discussed the prescription drug needs of the area. Also discussed the opioid epidemic and the latest drug dispensing protocols.
Thrilled to help unveil the newly rebuilt #Flushing-Main Street @LIRR Station, a project I’ve strongly advocated for since I was a member of the NYS Assembly. The overhaul will improve passenger safety, enhance the appearance of the station make it handicap accessible. #Queens
Great time meeting with local seniors and discussing issues that concern them during visit to the Peter Cardella Senior Center in #Ridgewood. #Queens
Good meeting with new @LIRR President Phillip Eng. Discussed improving service for riders, the renovations and upgrades to LIRR stations in #Queens and other issues. Also thanked him for saving the Lefferts Boulevard Bridge in #KewGardens.
Spoke with @CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield about the origins of adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census.  @SecretaryRoss lied straight to my face about where this request came from. This was never about protecting voting rights.
Proud to announce that my next @DeptVetAffairs office hours will be on Oct. 24. If you're a local #veteran or beneficiary that would like to meet with a representative from the VA, I encourage you to contact my office to make an appointment. Please call 718-358-MENG by Oct. 22.
Also pleased to have obtained additional items in the #FAA bill that seek to improve the aviation industry. 2/2
Pleased to have secured several measures in the #FAA Reauthorization Act that the President recently signed into law, including provisions which aim to mitigate excessive airplane #noise over #Queens. 1/2

Called on AG Sessions to investigate @SecretaryRoss for lying to me during a hearing about a conversation he had with the White House on adding the citizenship question to the #2020Census. @TheJusticeDept
Israel is our most important ally in the Middle East and Democrats are committed to its safety and security. U.S. support for America’s friend and partner should never be made into a partisan issue.
Spoke with #NPR’s @hansilowang about the origins of adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census. Unconscionable that @SecretaryRoss lied to my face during a Congressional hearing on the issue.
Hate being lied to! Very displeased to learn that @SecretaryRoss lied to me on the origins of adding a citizenship question to the #2020Census at a hearing this spring. Not a tough question, but I guess when you’re in company with Steven Bannon, you’ve got to cover it up?
Proud to join @RepJudyChu’s bill that would defund @DHSgov’s proposed public charge rule. This proposed rule seeks to deny green cards to immigrants who lawfully use public benefits.  This is wrong. #ProtectFamilies

Sad about the death of former State Senator Frank Padavan. He was a tireless public servant who was a fixture in Queens. He championed important issues worked to address many neighborhood concerns. Proud to have worked w/ him while I was in Albany. Condolences to his family.
Proud to stand with postal workers from across #Queens to protest @RealDonaldTrump’s proposal to privatize the U.S. Postal Service. The U.S. mail is #NotForSale! #USPS
Upset to see #Kavanaugh confirmed to #SCOTUS today. Nothing in his confirmation process has given me confidence that he’ll be an independent, impartial, or even-keeled judge, particularly following his conduct last week. Incredibly sad day for our nation. #BelieveSurvivors
Sent a letter to the head of the @EPA expressing concern over the possible closure or minimized role of the Office of Children’s Health Protection, which has argued for tougher regulations on industrial pollutants. Trump Admin. must not abandon efforts to keep our kids safe.
Joining the @FlushingBID to announce #Flushing Business Day. The initiative, funded by @NYC_SBS, seeks to promote area businesses by attracting more consumers to Flushing. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Critical that we do all we can to help them succeed.
Today is #InternationalDayOfNonViolence which is celebrated on the birthday of Mahatma #Gandhi. I am sponsoring a resolution to commemorate the observance and pay tribute to Gandhi’s message of non-violence and peace. Critical that we remember the legacy that Gandhi left behind.
Deeply disturbed by @RealDonaldTrump’s decision to deny visas to same-sex domestic partners of foreign diplomats and U.N. employees. I oppose this dangerous decision by #POTUS and urge him to reverse it immediately. @HRC #EqualEverywhere
Wonderful to join #Bayside’s Armenian Church of the Holy Martyrs and members of the community for ceremony co-naming 210th Street and Horace Harding Expressway – the corner where the church is located – as Armenia Way.
Great time at the #Glendale Kiwanis luncheon. Proud to join the group in celebrating its 65th anniversary. Pictured with me are Glendale @Kiwanis President Kerrie Hansen and @BobHoldenNYC, @SenJoeAddabbo @assemblymanmike.
Terrible tragedy in #Indonesia. Heartbroken over the loss of life and destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunami. I send my thoughts and prayers to all who have been affected and I thank all the first responders who are working to rescue survivors.
Reminder: Tomorrow (Sunday, Sept. 30) at #ForestHills High School, my office Senator Gillibrand’s office will host Service Academy Day. I encourage high school students interested in applying to any of the U.S. Service Academies to attend. The event begins at 10:30 a.m. #Queens
