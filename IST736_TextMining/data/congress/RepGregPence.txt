️#HR1 = Bad for Hoosiers️Republicans offered language (which Democrats rejected) making it clear that giving illegal immigrants the right to vote devalues the voting power of American citizens.HR 1 is a Washington DC power grab that empowers illegal immigrants to vote.
️#HR1 Weakens Our Election System️It weakens our election system. Indiana controls its own elections, not unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.
️#HR1 Takes a Hammer to the First Amendment️It places such unprecedented limits to free speech that even the left-leaning @ACLU opposes it. Make no mistake, the left wants to stifle political discourse, as we see on college campuses, and this legislation furthers that goal.
️#HR1 is Unconstitutional️It places unprecedented limits to free speech and will subject Indiana to federal mandates that allow illegal immigrants to vote.
️#HR1 is a Washington DC power grab️It's all about politics, anti-Trumpism, electing Democrats and stifling political discourse. It's a hodge-podge list of far-left policies cooked up inside liberal think tanks. Democrats want to cover for an extreme minority on the far-left.
��� @HouseForeignGOP Update ���Today, the House Foreign Affairs Committee will take action to keep America safeWATCH LIVE
#HR1 Takes A Hammer To The First Amendment ��H.R. 1 places such unprecedented limits to free speech that even the @ACLU is opposed to it. Make no mistake, the left wants to stifle political discourse and this legislation will further that goal.
#HR1 Will Fund Democrat Campaigns With Taxpayer Money (7/7)Democrats want a new political ATM for congressional campaigns by granting a 6:1 taxpayer-funded match for all small donor contributions of $200 or less. So, for every $200, the federal government will match $1,200.
#HR1 Is Political Cover For The Far-Left (6/7)It's all about power, anti-Trumpism, electing Democrats stifling political discourse. It's a hodge-podge list of far-left policies cooked up inside liberal think tanks. Dems want to cover for an extreme minority on the far-left.
#HR1 Weakens Our Election System (5/7)This bill actually makes our election system more vulnerable to outside threats by employing a one size fits all standard. A big component of our election system's security is the de-centralized nature of the system.
#HR1 Takes A Hammer To The First Amendment (4/7) ��H.R. 1 places such unprecedented limits to free speech that even the @ACLU is opposed to it. Make no mistake, the left wants to stifle political discourse and this legislation will further that goal.
#HR1 Is A Power Grab (3/7)This bill takes decision-making power from Hoosiers and gives it to bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. It forces States to adopt online registration, same-day registration, and automatic voter registration, thus imposing a one-size-fits-all standard.
#HR1 Is Unconstitutional (2/7)It places unprecedented limits to free speech and will subject Indiana to federal mandates that allows for illegal immigrants to vote.
� Thoughts on #HR1 (Tweet Thread 1/7) �Do not be fooled, H.R. 1 is not a piece of legislation “for the people” as my colleagues across the aisle claim. This is nothing more than a power grab “for Democrats in Washington D.C.”
Always an honor to meet with fellow veterans from Indiana. Thank you to the VFW, Department of Indiana for stopping by to discuss issues affecting Hoosier vets. �� #Indiana #IN06
I applaud President @realDonaldTrump's work to address veterans suicide. Twenty service members and veterans commit suicide every day. We MUST care for the men and women who served and sacrificed on behalf of this great nation.
Thank you to the Read and Burkle families for stopping by our D.C. office. It's always good to spend some time with 6th District Hoosiers while I'm stuck here in the Swamp. �� #Indiana #IN06
My number one priority is spending time with the people I serve. We had a great discussion with constituents in Greenfield, where I shared some experiences from my first couple of months in Congress. #Indiana #IN06

Busy day ahead of us with our Foreign Affairs Committee Hearing and lots of meetings with 6th District Hoosiers. @HouseForeignGOP

President @realDonaldTrump and @HouseGOP have offered multiple deals that secures the border, addresses the humanitarian crisis, and pays federal workers. I will continue to urge @SpeakerPelosi and House Democrats to negotiate in good faith. Enough is enough.
While Democrat Party leadership continues to play political games w/ border security, the opioid crisis and our federal workers; House Republicans are committed to REAL ACTION. I urge @SpeakerPelosi and Democrats to negotiate in good faith, secure the border and end the shutdown.
President @realDonaldTrump put forward a serious and reasonable offer to secure our border and reopen government. @SpeakerPelosi and Democrat Party leadership should negotiate in good faith. Offering $1 for border security is not serious, it's insulting to the American people.
We look forward to serving the Sixth District on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. As the Crossroads of America, Indiana will continue to lead! @TransportGOP ��
Today, we honored the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.—a great American hero who fought for equality and justice for all Americans—during the 22nd Annual #MLKDay Community Breakfast in Columbus.

Speaker Pelosi and the Democrat Party leadership are more interested in political games than actual solutions. Democrats made this clear today by declining an invite by @POTUS (@realDonaldTrump) to discuss border security and ending the shutdown. Shameful.

There is a humanitarian crisis in this country, and Democrat Party leadership is either failing to understand it or refusing to acknowledge its existence.
Minority Whip @SteveScalise is spot on. Democrats are refusing to negotiate in good faith. This isn't a partisan issue. It's a crisis. There were 794 opioid-related overdose deaths­­­ in Indiana in 2016 w/ a large increase in heroin-related deaths: 114 in 2012 - 297 in 2016.
RT @therepublicnews: Rep. Pence supports border wall; declines pay during shutdown 
The House just passed S. 24 (Government Employee Fair Treatment Act) which guarantees back-pay to federal employees affected by the shutdown. Federal employees and their families shouldn't lose their paychecks because Democrat Party leadership refuses to negotiate in good faith.
I've met w/ sheriffs and the DEA. The opioid crisis is being fueled by fentanyl and other drugs and products coming from the southern border. The humanitarian crisis in the 6th District is the deaths and damage to families and communities. @therepublicnews
The people of the Sixth District sent me to Washington to secure the border. This isn't a partisan issue. It's common sense. @therepublicnews
Despite the shutdown, members of Congress continue to receive pay. I’m suspending my pay until Congress does its job. I was sent to Washington to secure the border and make government work. I support the president’s proposal to secure the border and it’s time for Congress to act.
