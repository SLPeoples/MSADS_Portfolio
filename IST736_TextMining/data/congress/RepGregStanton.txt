When our democracy works #ForThePeople, and when we lift the voices of everyday Americans, elected officials can focus on the issues that matter most to constituents. ️Quality jobs️Affordable health care️Clean air and water️Strong infrastructure
Today we’re delivering on our promise to pass long overdue reforms to:️Get dark money out of politics ️Limit special interests’ influence ️Make elections clean and fair️Demand more of elected officialsH.R. 1 truly is #ForThePeople.
Today was a big one for @ASU and @WexfordSciTech! The future 200,000-square-foot building on the downtown Phoenix Biomedical Campus will house research labs, classrooms, and one-of-a-kind innovation spaces to help advance our fast-growing bioscience industry.
The American people ought to know who is writing big checks to their elected officials and candidates for office. By curbing the influence of special interests, we can lift the voices of everyday Americans. We can do better. And with #HR1, we will do better. #ForThePeople

This morning, our @HouseJudiciary Committee is holding a hearing on protecting DREAMers. Hundreds of thousands of young people face uncertain futures in our country—we need to make finding a solution for DREAMers a priority. WATCH
March is #WomensHistoryMonth, a time to recognize and celebrate the incredible women trailblazers who have changed the world. Spending time to reflect on #HERStory also reminds us that our work isn’t over and we must continue the fight for gender equality.
Coffee with the Congressman is happening now at The Nile Coffee Shop in downtown Mesa. We will be here until 3:30, stop by!
Glad to have you on the team! We're ready to get to work making health care more accessible and affordable. #forthepeople

This morning, @HouseJudiciary is holding a hearing on Trump's family separation policy. There are far too many unanswered questions about what's happening to families at our border. Watch the hearing live:
The President’s emergency declaration is unconstitutional and creates a dangerous precedent. I'm co-sponsoring the resolution to terminate this declaration because actions like this must only be used for real national emergencies—not to make up for political failure.
I will never stop believing that together we can end HIV/AIDS. Thank you to @auntritas for your tireless work—alongside so many dedicated community leaders and organizations—to eliminate HIV/AIDS from our communities for good. #UequalsU
Mark your calendars for March 8-9, when the Ida B. Wells Society for Investigative Reporting is hosting a Boot Camp in Phoenix at

We're heading into the last week of #BlackHistoryMonth, but our commitment to learning from the history and celebrating the achievements of African Americans is ongoing and year-round. I want to highlight a few events that are coming soon to the Valley:
Traffic safety and roadway construction safety are big issues in a state with as much construction and growth as Arizona. We’re lucky to have two of the nation’s leading companies @Trafficade and Pavement Marking Inc. in Arizona. Thanks to @ATSSAHQ for coordinating today’s visit.
Today, to honor and remember the thousands of Japanese-Americans who were rounded up and incarcerated during World War II, we welcomed the @smithsonian exhibit “Righting a Wrong” to @azcapitolmuseum. It’s a reminder to remain vigilant and speak out against racism and bigotry.
Luke is one of Arizona’s crown jewels—essential to our national defense and our regional economy—and we must do everything we can to keep it strong.
I’m at Faith Lutheran Church this morning in Phoenix hosting a town hall discussion on #HR1, sharing everything we’re doing in Congress to restore our democracy #ForThePeople.
Declarations of emergency should not be used as a work-around to the legislative process. This is the wrong way to govern, and the President is only creating a dangerous precedent for our country.
Today marks one year since the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. We stand with the entire community of Parkland as we mourn the 17 lives lost at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. #MSDstrong
For the first time in decades, major gun violence prevention legislation just passed out of committee. I’m proud to co-sponsor and vote yes on #HR8. @HouseJudiciary’s historic vote puts us one step closer to making universal background checks a reality. #EndGunViolence
My team was excited to discuss the work that @habitatcaz does for our neighborhoods and ways we can partner in the future. Since 1985, Habitat and its volunteers have built and renovated more than 1,100 homes and served more than 3,000 families in Arizona. Thank you!
Seeing #PWD employed at @TCHArizona through @AbilityOne75 and @SAAdvocacy is a poignant reminder of the potential of people with disabilities. Enjoyed learning more last week about how TCH empowers #PWD with employment opportunities and choices!

We may not be able to #EndGunViolence overnight, but we can take action today by moving #HR8 one step closer to the House floor. Our @HouseJudiciary Committee will mark up the bill on universal background checks—long overdue action to stop guns from getting into the wrong hands.

What an honor to attend tonight’s @specialolympics reception. I got to introduce Connor Cole, the most decorated olympian in Cortez High School history (my alma mater). He’s making us proud.
Today I met with David Skarphol from @NATCA to discuss the shutdown's impact on air traffic controllers at @PHXSkyHarbor. We agree: The #shutdown impacted our safety and held hundreds of thousands of workers’ paychecks and well-being hostage. We can't afford another one.
Our @HouseJudiciary Hearing on Oversight of the Department of Justice with Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker is happening now. Watch it live:
Happening now: We’re examining the state of our nation’s infrastructure and the cost of ignoring growing needs. Glad my friend @ericgarcetti is here today representing cities on an issue that has been a top priority for mayors—and now this Congress.

AZ pre-#SOTU huddle with our guests: DREAMer Ellie Perez, Navajo Nation Vice President Myron Lizer and environmentalist Christina McVie.
This week @TransportDems will have our first hearing on the #CostOfInaction—to take a close look at the current state of our nation’s infrastructure needs and the consequences of ignoring them. You bet I’m going to stand up for investment in Arizona.

There is real opportunity for the President to appeal to the better angels of our nature and make finding a solution for DREAMers a top priority during his #SOTU. Read more:
My friend and DACA recipient Ellie Perez will be my guest at Tuesday's State of the Union Address. Ellie is a reminder to all of us in Congress—and to President Trump—that our nation will be stronger when we pass immigration reform that fully embraces DREAMers as Americans.
Great to visit with so many friends from home this week. Both @head_az and @AzSBA stopped by to talk about their priorities for the year—two groups committed to giving our kids the tools they need to thrive in school.

1 in 3 young people grow up without a mentor—let’s change that. Thanks to the team from @MENTORnational for stopping by to talk about investing in quality youth mentoring. We’ll hang up our @FreeArtsAZ artwork as a daily reminder to support the next generation of leaders.
The #PaycheckFairness Act will ban retaliation against workers who ask about pay; require employers to prove pay disparities exist for job-related reasons only; support wronged employees; improve @USDOL's enforcement tools; support businesses with best practices and more.
56 years after the Equal Pay Act, pay discrimination is still very real. Women make only 80 cents for every $1 a man earns, and the gap is wider for women of color. I'm proud to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairness Act, an important step forward for women, families and our economy.
Our first @HouseJudiciary hearing on #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, is happening now. The first step to restoring confidence in our democracy and integrity in our government.Watch live:

Over the weekend, I met with nonprofit leaders in Arizona who work with victims of domestic violence. Their federal funding is critical, and without it, some are being forced to turn people away. This shutdown is hurting our most vulnerable—it has to end.
Thank you to the individuals who joined me this afternoon and spoke so openly and honestly. Thank you for continuing to care and serve, even in the toughest conditions. We are indebted to the work you and countless others do every day.
I’m headed back to Washington tomorrow to share these stories and advocate for the people I heard from today—and the hundreds of thousands of others impacted by this needless shutdown. There’s just no way around it, we have to get our government working again.
But they also shared with me their new stark reality: Coming home with no paycheck in sight is hurting their families. Some are considering paying penalties to dip into retirement. Others are concerned about accessing their health care benefits. The effects are serious and real.
Despite the furloughs, despite the low morale for those forced to work without pay—many of these individuals were most upset that the shutdown has stalled or halted the critical services they provide the American people.
Several employees and service providers are looking ahead and realizing that the shutdown will disrupt their work plans and budgets for the rest of the year. The consequences they fear will fall back to our residents: from forgone airport safety trainings to wildfire prevention.
This afternoon I met with more than a dozen Arizonans affected by the government shutdown. Each described to me the ways in which they feel held hostage each day this shutdown continues—their stories were both heartbreaking and frustrating.
Next week, I will once again vote to re-open the government. We will continue to put forward constructive, reasonable and bipartisan solutions to end the shutdown and get our government working again for the American people.
Nearly 90 percent of @DHSgov employees—those on the front lines—are working without pay. 53,000 TSA employees, 54,000 ICE officers, and 42,000 Coast Guard active duty members. It’s immoral and it puts our safety at risk.
The @USEEOC—the agency that makes sure employees are protected from race, sex, religion, sexual orientation or gender discrimination—is closed. Mediations have been cancelled and pending cases are being suspended.
Thousands of federal employees responsible for enforcing public health, safety, consumer rights and environmental laws are on furlough. Food safety is at risk, and the shutdown is creating a backlog of approvals for new innovative prescription drugs and medical devices.
E-Verify has been unavailable during the shutdown, which means more than 750,000 private sector employers who rely on the service can’t use it to hire new workers and fill jobs. That’s just plain harmful to our economy.
Most immigration judges are on furlough. Cases are essentially frozen. Our courts are already facing a massive backlog of 800,000+ pending cases, with new ones now rescheduled several years out. Considering the president’s posture on border security, this disruption is absurd.
Grant payments from @TheJusticeDept are now in jeopardy. Domestic violence shelters across the nation—many of which rely on federal grant funds each month—could struggle to keep their doors open and be forced to turn away women and children.
We’re about to enter the second month of this needless shutdown. Tomorrow, I’ll meet with people in AZ who are directly feeling the negative impacts. But I want to take a moment to share how the shutdown’s effect on law enforcement and safety organizations is hurting people.
Two great assignments for working on issues that matter to the future of Arizona. I look forward to working with communities across the state to deliver results on the Transportation Infrastructure and Judiciary committees.
Honored to learn this evening that I’ll be serving on the House Judiciary Committee—a key assignment for Arizona as we work to reform our nation’s broken immigration system. I’m excited to get to work.
24 days of this shutdown has left many American families wondering how they will cover their basic costs of living. We’ve heard from a number of residents feeling scared and hurt, and who are asking us to restore certainty to their lives. Enough is enough. #EndTheShutdown
We got to work on day one to re-open the government and get it working again for the American people. And we wasted no time our first week, coming together to create real, bipartisan results.
Eight years after Tucson, we'll do more than hold a moment of silence. Today we offer a bill to require universal background checks for gun sales. I'm proud to stand with @GabbyGiffords, @ShuttleCDRKelly, @RepThompson, and many more to make this common-sense proposal a reality.
Welcome to my official House twitter account! Please follow along for updates about the work we're doing in the 116th Congress and at home for the people of #AZ09.
