No one likes changing the clock. That's why I'm supporting a bill that makes daylight saving time year-round.
Yesterday, I joined Bill Logan on @mysuncoast to discuss my busy week in Washington! Watch the full video here:
RT @GOPoversight: Which of #MichaelCohen’s lies do you think was the worst?Ratio this.
Yesterday, I introduced a bill to study the effects of radiation on Vets who served in the Enewetak Atoll cleanup in the late 1970s. I’m committed to listening to Veterans ensuring they receive the care they deserve. To learn more, visit my website:
Under H.R. 1, taxpayer dollars will be going to support entrenched politicians and political consultants who we don’t agree with or want to support.
Our tax dollars should go to funding our military and protecting American citizens, not to promoting politicians we don’t even agree with. That’s why I’m voting no on H.R. 1.
H.R. 1 takes power away from voters and puts it in the hands of convicted criminals. The bill would strip voters of their 14th Amendment rights to limit the vote to people who haven’t been convicted of murder, violent felonies, or other serious crimes.
H.R. 1 is a slap in the face to our democratic system. This bill attacks the rights of the states and puts our election security at risk.
Under H.R. 1, there would be no checks and balances to prevent voter fraud and no penalties for ineligible individuals voting in error.
Same-day voter registration is a threat to our democratic process. When voters are allowed to register on the same day there is very little room to confirm identity and ensure they are voting in the correct election.
Every day, personal data is at risk online. With H.R. 1, the democrats would add to this threat by requiring states to maintain online voter registration with no safeguards.
H.R. 1 would require that all states adopt an automatic voter registration system that would rely on the federal government for records. This could lead to thousands of registration errors and the registration of ineligible voters.
Don’t be fooled—H.R. 1 is legislation that has been designed to fund, elect, and maintain the Democratic majority, all while ignoring states’ rights and wasting taxpayer dollars.
Who in their right mind enjoys changing the clocks twice a
My statement on H. Res. 183:
The farmers in my district agree: biannual changes in time don’t help agriculture, they hurt it. Let’s make Daylight Saving Time permanent across the United States!
Year-round Daylight Saving Time will improve our health, our economy, and our safety. Let’s make it happen!
Proud to continue my work to make Daylight Saving Time permanent with my fellow Floridians.
Switching our clocks twice a year is an unnecessary and outdated practice. Last year, the Florida legislature overwhelmingly supported my measure, and now it’s up to Congress to make it happen. Proud to cosponsor @VernBuchanan and @SenRubioPress’s bill.
Thanks for stopping by, it was great to meet you!
Great to be back with Bill Logan on @mysuncoast to talk about my week in Washington. From my questioning of #MichaelCohen, to my efforts to protect our 2nd Amendment rights, we discussed what I've been working on and what I'm gearing up to do in March.
No question about it, #MichaelCohen is a liar. It’s embarrassing that @HouseDemocrats had us sit through this circus. Meanwhile, @realDonaldTrump is in Vietnam addressing real issues.
Our Second Amendment rights are at stake. @HouseDemocrats want to rob us of our constitutionally guaranteed protections in the name of violence prevention, all while doing nothing to actually prevent violence.
As written now, the current House gun control proposal would have done nothing to prevent many of the tragedies with firearms we’ve witnessed in recent years. #Support2A
Requiring additional background checks does nothing if the check isn’t run against a complete database—let’s focus on implementation of current laws like #FixNICS before creating new ones. #Support2A
The current gun control legislation before the House will criminalize the private transfer of firearms, including to some family members, prohibiting Americans from exercising their right to self-defense. #Support2A
Hey @HouseDemocrats—how about instead of creating new laws, we better apply the ones we already have on the books? What’s the value of a background check without quality and accurate data in the system? #FixNICS #Support2A
(2/2) 1. Require failed background checks to be reported to law enforcement.2. Require illegal immigrants be reported to ICE if they attempted to purchase a firearm. #Support2A
(1/2) Just got off the House Floor discussing the Democrats’ gun control legislation, H.R. 8. This bill is nothing more than a political stunt. If Democrats cared about solving problems, they would have supported my amendment that would do two things:
Don’t be fooled: House Dems claim their gun control bill is a solution to gun violence, but it does nothing to solve real problems like our nation’s mental health crisis. #Support2A
RT @USTermLimits: Congress overwhelmingly passed HJR27 which would establish #TermLimits for POTUS in 1947 4yrs later #OTD, 2/27/51, the…
Democrats don't want to stop gun violence, they want to infringe on the constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens. We must stop H.R. 8! #Support2A
H.R. 8 will criminalize the private transfer of firearms and will make exercising basic constitutional rights impossibly expensive for millions of law-abiding Americans. #Support2A
H.R. 8 claims to be a solution to gun violence yet does nothing to solve real problems that contribute to this crisis. #Support2A
I am about to speak on the House floor on #HR8, the Democrats gun control bill. Tune in to @cspan now!
Last week, I sat down with @HeraldTribune to discuss my first months in Congress. From adjusting to life in DC, to bills I'm supporting, we discussed a number of topics important to me this term. Check it out here:
Thank you @fema for granting Punta Gorda over $21.2 Million to reimburse expenses related to Hurricane Irma damage through the Public Assistance program. If you are interested in applying for the program, please contact my office for more information.
Jennifer and I were excited to meet @BretBaier at this evening’s Club for Growth Foundation event!
Great to visit with @SenTedCruz this morning. Thanks for all you do to protect our freedoms. I look forward to working with you!
I was honored to join my colleagues, @RepMarkMeadows and @RepRatcliffe, at the Club for Growth Foundation Economic Retreat. We discussed the role of oversight in the new Congress and the importance of pro-growth, limited government policies that allow Americans to prosper.

Tune in to @mysuncoast tomorrow night at 7:00 PM to catch my interview with @BillLoganABC7. Hope you will take the time to watch!
Today, I was honored to host a Water Quality Round Table in my Punta Gorda Office. I’m committed to working with state, local, and federal officials to address water quality issues facing my district and my state. Learn more on my website:
Today, I visited the @HomeDepot in Venice, FL. I toured the store, discussed their “Doing More for Veterans Program,” and even got my own apron! Looking forward to doing everything I can in DC to support jobs private enterprise in Florida’s 17th District! Thanks for having me!
This morning, I visited with the Punta Gorda City Commissioners to give them a legislative update on what I’ve been working on in DC. It is great to be in Florida hearing about the important issues facing my constituents!

House Judiciary Dems aren’t interested in stopping gun violence, they’re interested in pushing a political agenda that ignores the rights of millions of law-abiding gun owners. This was clear when they rejected my Amendment this afternoon. Learn more here:

Today I filed an amendment that requires anyone who fails a background check to be reported to law enforcement. Dems voted against it. This gun control bill isn’t about public safety. It’s about taking away the rights of law-abiding citizens.
My statement on the #SOTU
Tonight @realDonaldTrump gave an inspiring speech with common sense solutions to big problems facing our country. #BuildThatWall #SOTU
Our veterans have been neglected for far too long. I look forward to serving on the Veterans' Affairs committe and introducing policies that will have a meaningful impact on our nation's heroes.
Congress was in session for only three days this week, and Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats have yet to offer a serious proposal that secures our borders. Madam Speaker, we're waiting!
Washington is a mess, but I am working day in and day out to #SecureOurBorders once and for all! Thank you @mysuncoast for having me on!
My thoughts and prayers are with the victims of today’s tragic shooting in Sebring. We will stand by law enforcement as they continue their investigation. Thank you Sheriff Blackman and the brave men and women of @HighCoSheriff’s Office. To the people of Sebring, we are with you.

Looking forward to it! @Jim_Jordan
My appointment to these committees will ensure I will fight in support of a wall on our southern border, protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse, and that our veterans will have one of their own fighting for them in Congress.
