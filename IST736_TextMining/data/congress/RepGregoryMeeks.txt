As a former DA, I don't indict just for the sake of indictment, but to convict also. Before we get to impeachment, we must get to the facts, whether through Mueller or House investigations, and present a concrete case to the Senate who will ultimately decide whether to convict.
We as members of Congress have a constitutional duty to conduct oversight on this President, and that means investigating his many, many lies. Facts matter; lets shine some light on them.
