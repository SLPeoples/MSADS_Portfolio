In just a few days, @HouseDemocrats are going to take back the gavel and move forward with our plan to end the #TrumpShutdown. It's time Washington start working
On day 7 of #TrumpShutdown, @realDonaldTrump instructed 420,000 fed employees working without pay to trade manual labor for reduced rent.Instead of forcing hundreds of thousands of Americans to work TWO jobs this holiday, Trump needs to do his ONE job reopen the government.
Fact check: The 400,000+ Americans working without pay this holiday are NOT all (or mostly) Democrats. But Democrats sure are going to be the ones who get these folks their money back when we take the gavel in January.

Trump’s tantrums have forced the nation into political economic chaos. His behavior this shutdown are inexcusable. For the sake of our nation, House Republicans President Trump need to do their job, fund the government, put an end to this mess.
78% of American workers live paycheck to paycheck. Trump the GOP just don't get it. This isn't politics. This isn't a game. It's people's lives. #TrumpShutdown
