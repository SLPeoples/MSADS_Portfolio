Mr. Dingell was a true friend to Michigan’s automakers. And like any good friend, he pushed them to better themselves. He will be remembered for his tireless work to protect the backbone of our economy in southeast Michigan when times were tough.
This week, I cosponsored the Raise the Wage Act to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 by 2024.It’s time to recognize the value of work – no one who works full time in this country should have to live in poverty.
My dear friend, John Dingell was a true leader and devoted his life’s work to our great nation and the bettering of generations to come.
Congressman John Dingell made immeasurable contributions to our home state of Michigan over nearly six decades of service in the United States House of Representatives.
