I am proud to fight for these brave Georgians and can't wait to see them in Washington D.C. as part of the  @FWDus’ fly-in, where Dreamers and TPs holders will be meeting with Members of Congress.
Local economies will hurt if #DACA beneficiaries like Cinthya and TPS holders like Roxana are deported. That is why I am recommitting to doing my part in Congress and ensure we pass permanent legislative solutions that allow Cynthia and Roxana to remain in their home state of GA.
The Trump Administration has terminated both DACA and TPS - and without permanent legislative solutions, both Roxana and Cinthya could face deportation. That's regardless of the fact that both of them have lived here for decades and have built their lives in the United States.
Cinthya is a Dreamer, who is currently being shielded from deportation thanks to the DACA program which, since 2012, has allowed 700,000 Dreamers to use their talents to become contributing members of society.
In 2001, President Bush authorized TPS for immigrants from El Salvador - allowing Roxana to work live free from the fear of deportation. Years later, Roxana has grown up to be a successful academic, role model, and an integral part of her community.
Roxana arrived in the United States after escaping the violent conditions that gripped her native country of El Salvador during the late 1980s. Roxana was 4 years old.
Cinthya, who graduated from high school with an impressive 3.8 GPA while being dual enrolled in college-level courses, is determined to use her passion for learning to become a cardiovascular surgeon.
Roxana, a Ph.D. candidate at @EmoryUniversity’s Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, is researching ways to help farm workers avoid illnesses from working long hours under the sun by focusing on how to cool workers’ body temperatures.
Earlier today, I joined members of the press to highlight the accomplishments contributions of 2 outstanding members from across our community: Roxana Chicas and Cinthya Moran.

3) The proposed public charge rule will increase hunger. Decreased participation among Georgia immigrant families in food assistance could lead to higher levels of poverty food insecurity.
2) Simply put, this rule change will make our communities sicker because families will fear to participate in Medicaid could result in coverage losses throughout GA, decreased access to care, and worse health outcomes for the entire family, including U.S. citizen children.
