I’m not satisfied with a status quo where my daughter has to work harder for fewer opportunities than my sons. On #InternationalWomensDay, I think about the responsibility of each and every member of Congress to create a country where women enjoy the same rights freedoms as men
For too long, we've been unable to debate key issues or even talk to each other because of the grip of special interests on this town. Today the House will pass H.R. 1 the #ForThePeopleAct, the first step on the road towards repairing our broken politics.
Unethical sober homes in OC have made it extremely difficult for families, treatment centers, and court systems to identify housing which can actually help them. The opioid crisis has devastated our nation--we've got to guarantee that treatment homes are ethical and really work.
Glad to have a chance to be on @OutnumberedOT today and speak with @MelissaAFrancis
At the @transportdems hearing today I called for funding for @OCWDWaterNews and @OCSewers water recycling projects. We've got to consider #climatechange when we think about how to spend infrastructure dollars, and I'm pleased OC is taking the lead.
I was proud to work with my Republican colleague Rep. @virginiafoxx to pass an amendment to the #ForThePeople Act harmonizing a Senate rule with the rules of the House to shore up Congressional ethics.
Had a good chat with ⁦@ChrisEvans⁩ about how we can protect the world from its biggest existential threat.And no it’s not HYDRA, it’s climate change...
The Comptroller of the United States says that the cost of inaction on climate change would be "incalculable." Why is the White House panel tasked with examining climate change headed by a climate denier?

The @OversightDems Environmental Subcommittee Hearing, which I chair, begins now. FB live it here:
Whether the president is a Democrat or a Republican, the American public wants the truth.
Looking forward to being on @CNNSitRoom with @wolfblitzer tonight - hope you’ll tune in at 3 PT/6 ET!
Today is AAPI Equal Pay Day. Over her career, the typical AAPI woman loses at least $292,400 to the wage gap. This disparity cannot go on--we must pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, and guarantee #AAPIEqualPay
Tomorrow is the first hearing of the @OversightDems Environment Subcommittee that I chair. We'll be investigating how toxic chemicals have continued to infect our water supply without action from the EPA. Look for the hearing on Facebook live tomorrow
Photo of the week: @RepDeanPhillips and I had the opportunity to meet Sidney Walton, a 100 year old WWII Veteran.  (CQ Roll Call:
The @BrailleInst is a non-profit that runs a series of centers dedicated to providing services and educational programs for the blind and visually impaired across OC. #Teamrouda had a chance to attend the ribbon cutting and Grand Opening of its newest campus in Anaheim!
Last week, #teamrouda attended the signing of the Fullerton Education Partnership, which creates a pipeline for students attending/transferring from Fullerton College to Cal State Fullerton. This new program will open up new opportunities in higher education to students across OC
I can tell you, if a Democratic president had one ounce of what we're seeing here under President Trump, I would want to investigate and know the truth. I believe our constituents in Orange County want the same thing, and across the country--we just want the truth.
Last week I met Sidney Walton, an 100 year old WWII veteran who fought to eradicate Nazism.Those ruinous beliefs are again ascendent, infecting our politics. We owe it to Sidney our kids to call it out not whitewash these moments, in my district or anywhere in the US -HR
Last week I introduced the Coastal Communities Adaptation Act, to brace these communities for climate change. I talked about it at the @TransportDems hearing this week, look forward to working with my infrastructure-minded colleagues across the aisle to pass this bill into law.
It has been 100 years since Women won the hard-fought right to vote, yet Women do not have fully equal rights, liberties, and pay. This month it's on us to think as much about how to make the future better, as we do about Women's contributions in the past
Yesterday at the @OversightDems hearing, Cohen told me that the President lied under oath about his relationship with Felix Sater—which appears to have been a close one.I look forward to my colleagues serving on the Intelligence Committee getting closer to the truth.
Last week I signed onto a letter calling on Trump to push the Vietnamese govt to release Michael Nguyen, a US citizen imprisoned without charges for over 7 months. I'm outraged by human rights abuses in Vietnam, and I stand with OC's Vietnamese
This month, the extreme weather in OC caused $13 million in property damage. The OC BOS has declared an emergency. Climate change has arrived in CA--that's why I introduced the Coastal Communities Adaptation Act. We can't wait any longer to #ActOnClimate
The @Surfrider Foundation protects our beaches--an essential element of our coastal community in #CA48. We spoke today about the effects of proposed offshore drilling. The Dept. of the Interior doesn't get to open our shores to special interests at the expense of residents.
Last night I talked to @donlemon about the revelation that Donald Trump lied under oath about his relationship with Felix Sater at the @OversightDems hearing.
Gun violence shouldn't be partisan. More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks--thousands of Americans die every year by gun violence. I'm a proud cosponsor of HR8, which just became the first major gun reform bill to pass the House in decades. #EndGunViolence
Today Michael Cohen told me that convicted Russian mobster Felix Sater occupied an office on Trump's floor, the same one Cohen himself later moved into. I asked: Based on those facts, isn’t it true that Donald Trump misled at best, or at worst lied under oath?Michael Cohen: Yes
RT @BBCWorld: “Is it true that President Trump lied under oath?”“Yes”Democrat Harley Rouda pushes Donald Trump's ex-lawyer Michael Cohen…
Congress doesn’t block for the President. We serve the American people. Why have my Republican colleagues failed to ask even one question about Trump’s activities? If we seek the truth, what are they afraid we’ll find?This committee’s job is oversight, time to clock in.
The White House isn’t just separating familes at the border– their policy of mass deportation is tearing Vietnamese American families in California. I stand with my Southeast Asian constituents and @CAPAC colleagues against these callous deportations
Today those of us on @OversightDems will have a chance to look the Michael Cohen in the eye and get closer to the facts of what the President knows and when he knew it. Let’s not waste a minute of it on partisan grandstanding, and deliver the truth the American people are seeking
After 250 years of fighting for the right to vote, our democratic rights are still under threat. It's time to #RestoretheVOTE: I am cosponsoring the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which restores the protections and enforcement of the Voting Rights Act to its former strength.
At today's @TransportDems hearing, we asked experts how we can overhaul our energy infrastructure to battle climate change.
In CA, climate change has already arrived. If we take a serious approach to infrastructure, we can both reduce carbon emissions, and make our district more resilient to the consequences of climate change. I’m glad @transportdems are holding a hearing on that very idea today.
Nearly a year after Trump’s DHS began separating children from their parents at the border, we still don’t know the extent of the practice or the lasting damage it wrought. Today I voted with @oversightdems to subpoena the administration for those answers.
Thanks for having me, OC. Heading back to DC to work for the constituents of #CA48!
This national emergency declaration was an unlawful dodge of checks and balances. It will rob Californians of disaster relief funds for real emergencies. Today the House will pass a privileged resolution blocking the declaration. I urge Senators with common sense to do the same.
My reflections on Tuesday’s town hall, in the @ocregister this
Today I introduced the Coastal Communities Adaptation Act. We need to address the reality of climate change if we want to keep the same quality of life when oceans rise. My constituents in #CA48 deserve action. With the Trump Admin ignoring this crisis, it's up to Congress to act
Today I joined CNN with @ErinBurnett to talk about the coming Oversight Hearing with testimony from Michael Cohen
The I-405 widening project is the largest transportation project in CA, and it’s right in the heart of #CA48. Thank you to the @goOCTA for briefing me on this project—I’ll be an advocate on @TransportDems for more federal funds to bring OC’s infrastructure into the 21st Century.
Joining @RepKatiePorter and @RepGilCisneros now in a panel discussion on serving Orange County in Congress, at the OC Forum.
It was a pleasure to tour @OCWDWaterNews and learn more about their efforts to create a sustainable water supply. I’m committed to including access to clean water for Orange County in any bipartisan infrastructure package.
I also had a chance today to tour CA48’s biggest employer, @Hyundai, and take questions from employees. I love their commitment to Orange County and to giving back to our community.
In case you missed my first town hall last night—And yes, I do intend to fight like hell to make sure the federal government works for California.
We brought healthcare stakeholders across OC together to map out a future in healthcare where everyone is covered, by:-Opening up Medicare to everyone-Allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices-Reinstating the individual mandate-Utilizing innovation and supporting research
POTUS will convene a committee to study whether climate change is a national security threat.But he’s appointing a climate skeptic to head it up.We already know it’s the biggest national security threat, full stop. This isn’t a joke for

I spoke to @AlexWitt on MSNBC this weekend about Trump's national emergency declaration– it’s an assault on the constitution. When it comes to our founding principles, both houses of Congress need to walk the walk and block this declaration.
Chaos and dysfunction cannot be allowed to govern our national security. Nuclear proliferation mistakes cannot be undone.It's time for the White House to get serious about our security, and that means we need to shed sunshine on their relationship with Saudi Arabia.
Our @oversightdems report reveals that White House advisors including Michael Flynn Jared Kushner were possibly still are working to rush highly sensitive nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia, and some stood to personally make money off new power plants.We will investigate.
Presidents Day is a reminder of the giants of American history who have occupied our seats in Congress—like Lincoln, Kennedy, Bush Sr. They knew these seats don’t belong to us, they’re a position of public trust. Let’s live up to their examples and make our time here matter.
In some cases those we lost will make headlines, though others will be laid to rest in anonymity. But all will have had someone who loved and needed them. May those of us who have the power to alter our deadly course have the courage to use it.
It’s easy to become numb to the deadly gun violence which has come to grip our country, but we cannot repeat often enough both our love commitment towards the survivors, nor our anger and disgust that, should we choose the easy path of inaction, tens of thousands more will die.
California endured mudslides, snow, and flash floods this week. Home in #CA48, my constituents underwent mandatory evacuations. Climate change has arrived in full force, and we can't afford to delay action any longer, much less condone denial altogether.
Hope to hear from you at my first Town Hall on Tuesday! RSVP here:

RT @CaucusOnClimate:
My friend, @RepGaramendi and I went on KCAL last night. A fictional national emergency would set a dangerous precedent for future presidents. Trump could use the declaration to raid billions from California's disaster relief funds- which Californians need for real emergencies.
.@RepGaramendi and I will be on KCAL and CBS tonight to address the threat Trump’s national emergency would pose to California.While we’re fighting fires and extreme weather, he would take billions from California’s disaster relief funds to pay for this monument to his ego.
The brinkmanship of the last two months is emblematic of the brokenness of our politics. It is time for us to walk away from shutdowns and emergency declarations, and work together in good faith to improve the lives of the people who sent us here
He would unlawfully steal money from Army Corps of Engineers projects, including $160 mil in CA-48, to fund a monument to his ego. When we face real emergencies like climate change the opioid crisis, it defies belief that he would so casually waste taxpayers’ money.
If he does indeed intend to declare a national emergency, President Trump will set a dangerous precedent for future presidents, Democrat or Republican, to abuse their authority to circumvent the checks and balances of the Constitution.
I know there are Republicans who care about the Climate Crisis as much as I do. I'm focused on finding bipartisan support here in Congress and working across the aisle. So let's work
As a coastal community, #CA48 relies on the Coast Guard to keep us safe, and I’m proud to hang their seal in my office.

It's been one year since 17 students and staff in Parkland, Florida were shot and killed. The survivors have been fighting every day since for action from this House- let's show our commitment to them by getting to work, not stopping until children stop dying from gun violence.
CA Community Colleges are powerful engines of social mobility. I met with the Coast Community College District to discuss how Congress can ease the burden on student borrowers, improve our aid system, empower our community colleges to open doors of opportunity for Californians.

The Dept of Interior wants to drill everywhere and ignore environmental consequences, including off the OC Coast. I'm cosponsoring @RepHuffman and @RepBrianFitz's bill to keep drilling out of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. This administration needs a reality check.
I just wrapped up a meeting with @TSA workers who are deeply concerned about the the looming possibility of another damaging shutdown. Federal employees can’t afford another manufactured crisis at their expense. It’s time for the President to get serious and work with us.

The Post's report confirms that the EPA has abandoned its watch under the Trump Admin. Congress won’t let this administration sell out the future of humankind to fossil fuel interests. We will be taking action to fight the Climate Crisis, and the EPA will be held to account.
At the @TransportDems hearing yesterday, I talked about the intersection between infrastructure and climate change. The climate crisis is the greatest threat to humankind, and green infrastructure is an opportunity to #ActOnClimate and modernize our economy.
I cosponsored the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act, which passed today with bipartisan support. #ChildCare4Vets is just common sense--it expands childcare services during appointments at the VA. Veterans shouldn’t have to choose between healthcare and taking care of their kids.
This transportation and infrastructure hearing is (refreshingly) light on partisanship and bluster. It's clear basically everyone here is dead serious about understanding this issue, and getting to work on an infrastructure package.Let's get it done.
This administration has had, at best, an awkward relationship with ethics. We must pass H.R. 1 to ensure that public servants can’t use their offices to enrich themselves.

Honored to celebrate Tết with my friend @tamnguyenabc, and bring in the New Year with my Vietnamese-American constituents.
My next stop was @PPOSBC’s newest health center in Costa Mesa. No other healthcare provider has to shoulder political motivated attacks at their literal doorstep, but they continue to provide essential healthcare for women. I’m proud to stand with Planned Parenthood in Congress.
Excited to work with this great group on economic development opportunities in OC!
Yesterday afternoon I had an opportunity to tour Jamboree Housing's affordable housing communities serving #CA48 today. The service they provide OC seniors, veterans, and the recently homeless is indispensable and a model for alleviating the housing crisis throughout the state.
.@CBP just reported the largest seizure of fentanyl in US History– at a port of entry. Not a dime of the billions @realDonaldTrump wants for his wall would have supported their work. That money should go towards the proven technologies infrastructure that agents are asking for.
Landed in OC last night– this morning enjoying breathing ocean air again. Looking forward to touring Jamboree Housing and Planned Parenthood this afternoon, and capping off the day with a Tết Celebration in Costa Mesa this evening. It’s *very* good to be back.
Acting EPA Admin Wheeler wants to be confirmed to run the agency, but he says he hasn’t been briefed on the alarming National Climate Assessment. It’s past time he catches up on climate science, and shows he’s willing to take action to reverse our course on climate change.
Yesterday showed us how Congress can work without the partisan incivility we’ve all come to take for granted. I was proud to vote with my colleagues unanimously to pass bills introduced by both Ds and Rs that help @DHSgov keep us safe. Let’s have more days like yesterday -HR
The people of OC sent me to Congress to lead on the existential issue of climate change. Yesterday, my chairmanship of the @OversightDems Environment subcommittee was made official, and we’re ready to work. @realdonaldtrump’s EPA won’t get away with denying the threat any longer.
Ten years ago, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. The law was a big step in recognizing that women deserve equal pay for equal work, but the fight isn’t over.
In our first @OversightDems hearing, I called for a holistic approach to prescription drug reform. The real cost of drugs is opaque to even the most seasoned expert—it might as well be a foreign language to patients. Patients deserve transparency across the system.
One of my responsibilities as a member of Congress is to support, coordinate with local government to be responsive to our constituents. I’m glad the @ACCOC and I could discuss solutions to a breadth of issues facing Orange County, from homelessness to noise pollution from SNA.
Great to speak with @AlexWitt about the next few weeks. Our colleagues of all political stripes must work together to keep the government open, and take a serious and smart approach to border security.
Here’s what the #TrumpShutdown cost us according to the experts @uscbo: $3 billion that will never be recovered. We can’t permit a shutdown to happen ever again.
