@RepStefanik Honored to serve with you, @RepStefanik! ��
Interested in giving politicians a 6:1 match for all small dollar campaign donations? Watch this to learn more about H.R. 1. ↓
This morning I spoke on the House floor about the litany of issues with #HR1. This bill is a complete federal takeover of our election system and is not “For the People.”
New jobs report is in and there are 156,949,000 employed Americans in the workforce today—this is the highest number ever recorded – lowering the unemployment rate to 3.8 percent. Sound economic policies continue to move America in the right direction.
How would you like your taxpayer dollars to pay for more robocalls of candidates you don’t even like or support? #HR1, the “For the People Act,” is better called the “Fund the Politician Act.”
Glad to hear that certain State Fair Community College students will now have an easier time transferring their credits to @Mizzou.
Tonight I voted for second House resolution condemning the anti-Semitism associated with Rep. Omar's repeated remarks. It's a shame we even need to have a resolution to proclaim this fact. Support for Israel the Jewish people is fundamental to our democratic ideals.
Congratulations to Columbia for winning 6th best place to live, a result of its “quintessential college town” feel! #MO4
#SorryNotSorry House Dems unsure whether to condemn anti-Semitism, pull HRes 186. Again. #ThursdayThoughts
Fellow GOP Colleague, @repdonyoung became the longest ever serving Republican in the U.S. House today. Don has served #Alaska � ��for over 46 years now worked with nine presidents. It’s an honor to serve alongside him. ��
Congratulations to the Moberly Greyhounds on their Region 16 Championship win and good luck at the @NJCAA district playoff game this Saturday!
I had an informative meeting today with Judy Krtek from @JDRFKansasCity to discuss the impact type 1 diabetes has on #MO4
Important @HASCRepublicans hearing this morning on the need to modernize our nuclear program. The ability to defend our country should be our utmost priority.  America can afford survival.
Did you know that #HR1 would send your taxpayer dollars to fund political campaigns? Not to fight the opioid epidemic, build roads or bridges - but to add 600% of taxpayer dollars to every small dollar donated by Americans.
Honored to hear @AmbJohnBolton this morning discuss steps we’re taking to meet threats around the world. Am thankful he is lending his seasoned voice to ensure America continues to be the beacon of freedom and strength.
Today I had the opportunity to meet with Audrain County Commissioners to discuss health insurance, transportation funding and cyber security issues in rural areas. #MO4
Thank you to Ambassador of Hungary László Szabó and his staff for stopping by my office to discuss international cooperation on pro-family and pro-life issues.
This afternoon I had a great meeting with the Missouri Alliance for Arts Education.
It was a pleasure meeting with the Central Missouri Area Agency on Aging and Care Connection for Aging Services.  Thanks for stopping by!
I enjoyed meeting with @Mizzou Extension and Engagement today to discuss the National Institute of Food and Agriculture and the future of agriculture research.
Does Pelosi really believe that Rep. Omar’s statements are anti-Semitic? This weekend she blithely promoted their shared cover on @RollingStone while Omar was doubling down that supporters of Israel “push for allegiance to a foreign
Today, I am pleased to share that I am a cosponsor of H.Res. 39, legislation that would designate March 2, 2019, as “Gold Star Families Remembrance Day.” These families sacrifice an incredible amount for our freedom, and I am glad for the opportunity to honor them.
On Wednesday, I was pleased to speak with Agriculture @SecretarySonny Perdue about the SNAP program and the opportunity for Kansas City to serve as the new home for two @USDA agencies that will be relocated out of Washington. Watch my questions here:
Sat down with healthcare professionals and community leaders in Hermitage to discuss how issues like drug abuse, limited access to transportation, and unaffordable healthcare plans are hurting our rural communities.
Stopped by @HavenMaternityH in Buffalo to learn about services they provide, such as a diaper hub and parenting classes, to those in need in the Dallas County Area.
I had a great time this morning visiting with the DIVAS. They’re a women’s professional development group located in Buffalo, MO
Back when I was teaching at @LebanonR3, many of my former students would call in “sick” on opening day for #MoTrout season at Bennett Spring. Now I know why! Got to experience opening day myself and had my first catch of the year!
RT @mostateparks: U.S. congresswoman, @RepHartzler, joined thousands of anglers for opening day of trout season at Bennett Spring SP.
Congratulations Lyn Woolford, Chief of the Ashland Police Department, on being voted America’s favorite crossing guard. Thank you for keeping the children of Missouri’s 4th district safe!
It was a pleasure to meet with members of @mocapnews this morning to learn about the services they offer in Missouri.
Deceptive "Medicare for All" is latest effort to socialize health care. It forces all Americans, including seniors on Medicare, into a one-size fits all plan, outlawing virtually all private health care coverage, including employer-sponsored insurance which 158M American enjoy.
It was an honor to receive the True Blue Award from the @FRCdc this morning. This award is given to members of Congress who consistently fight for faith, family and freedom, and I am humbled to receive it.
Today I voted against H.R. 8, which fails to focus on gun violence criminals who buy guns. Instead, it punishes law abiding gun owners by making it more difficult  to purchase guns, despite the constitutional right to do so. H.R. 8=politically motivated disingenuous, at best.
Today I enjoyed meeting Trayana Georgieva, a student from Bulgaria, who is currently attending Laquey High School through the U.S. State Department’s Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange program.
I appreciate the @HouseAgGOP hearing this morning and the leadership @SecretarySonny has provided on implementation of the Farm Bill and his perspective on the #GreenNewDeal and "farting cows": “Beyond giving our cattle @Pepto Bismol, I don’t know what we can do.”
Here’s some good news we can all get behind: it’s been 457 days since Kim Jong Un conducted a test missile launch (big difference from 2016 when NKorea launched a missile every 24 days…) and historic peace talks continue today between US and NKorea under Trump Administration.
.@SecretarySonny Perdue is sharing testimony today with the @HouseAgGOP Committee on the state of the rural economy. Tune in live here:
Today I voted against H.J. Res 46, legislation designed to stop the Administration’s efforts to protect our border. American presidents have declared national emergencies at least 31xs, and I support @POTUS's efforts to secure our border protect our families communities.

Thank you Grace Link, with the @MOVetsComm, for meeting with me to discuss ways veteran services in Missouri can be improved!
Today I got to hear from radio and television broadcasters across the Show-Me State. Thanks for stopping by!
It was great meeting with Rabbi Menken and students from Mesivta today!
(2/2) Not only would GND destroy American economy and bankrupt us, it would (according to an EPA climate model) avert 0.137 degrees Celsius of projected warming by year 2100 →  barely even measurable. The #GreenNewDeal is liberal extremism on steroids.
(1/2) Report suggests #GreenNewDeal could cost 93 TRILLION! A household would have to pay $36,100-65,300 annually to meet the cost. Don’t forget: this “deal” would also ban air travel and aim to reconfigure every building in the United States.
It was a pleasure meeting with Kenneth Goth and other Missouri @AmericanLegion members this morning to discuss veterans issues for the 116th Congress.
There’s still time to register! I will be hosting a live conversation that you can join on the phone online today at 6pm CT. Sign up to receive a call:
.@RepAnnWagner and I spoke with abortion survivor @MelissaOhden and @SBAlist President @MarjorieSBA after the Senate’s disappointing failure tonight to get enough votes to protect innocent babies who are born alive.
Visited the Aviation Classification Repair Activity Depot in Springfield (AVCRAD) where hard work and innovation have saved taxpayers over $100 million.  The AVCRAD plays a critical role in providing maintenance for the @Missouri_NG!
I visited with the talented students and faculty of Knob Noster High School’s Stealth Panther Robotics Club to see the innovative 3-D printed AMAD Switch Cover they designed. The DoD now uses this design in every B-2 Stealth Bomber that is produced. #MO4
This afternoon I was honored to take part in a Heroin Opioid Task Force Round Table, where I worked with my colleagues to explore different ways in which the national response to the opioid crisis can be improved.
Pleased to cosponsor H.R. 220, the National Lyme and Tick-Borne Diseases Control and Accountability Act. We know so little about Lyme Disease, yet it affects so many. Patients with the illness are also frequently misdiagnosed→ we need to learn more.
I had so much fun reading to Whiteman Elementary School’s kindergarten class last Friday. �� #learningisfun @Whiteman_AFB
On Friday I had the privilege of attending a groundbreaking ceremony for the new 79,120 sq ft Consolidated Operations Building at #WhitemanAirForceBase. This much needed facility will enhance combat readiness and bring several operational squadrons under one roof. @Whiteman_AFB
Pleased to hear of positive developments in @POTUS trade talks with China. China has been a bad actor for far too long and must be held accountable. Encouraged by continued progress towards a solution that provides certainty for MO farmers and ranchers.
Lowell I enjoyed taking our friend, Bill Shelton, out to lunch after church to celebrate his 92nd Birthday! ��. Bill was in the #merchantmarines during #WWII .  I love to hear his stories am so proud of him his service to our nation! ���

Had a great visit to the @Missouri_NG facility in Springfield today.
Thank you @Rotary club of Lebanon for allowing me to update you on what’s going on in Washington
Next week House Dems will bring a gun control rights-grabbing bill to the Floor. However, they rejected an amendment to inform law enforcement, including ICE, if an individual who applies for a gun fails a background check. Why? #PlayingPolitics #2ndAmendmentRights
RT @femaregion7: Busy day here at Region VII! #FederalExecutiveBoard (FEB) meeting in the morning,  then a meeting with our Administrator @…
It was such an honor to meet with Chris Stout from the Veterans Community Project to see how he’s providing homes and resources to #veterans in the Kansas City area@VCP_HQ
Met with @FEMAregion7 officials this morning to hear how my bill, the FEMA Relief Improvement Act, which was signed into law in 2017, is improving the disaster relief process for local communities
Happy #NationalFFAWeek! Proud of @MissouriFFA as their programs continue to successfully prepare our nation’s young leaders for the future of agriculture and life’s many challenges and opportunities.
RT @GovParsonMO: Proud to join @MissouriFFA today in celebration of #NationalFFAWeek. The future of Missouri agriculture lies in the hands…
It was encouraging to hear the steps @BooneHospital is taking to combat the #OpioidCrisis
Thanks Mike and Amy for showing me around your fantastic candy store, @CandyFactoryMO, in Columbia today! @COMOChamber @VisitColumbiaMO
Happy Presidents’ Day! Do you want to fly the flag today, in honor of Washington’s birthday? Here’s a helpful infographic that explains how. #PresidentsDay
Went to check on the calf born last night!  So cute and so sad @AOC and the #greennewdeal folks want to “get rid of” all what they call the “farting cows”!  #crazy #cattle #agriculture @mofarmbureau @BeefUSA
This year marks a new beginning in space exploration, not just for America but for all mankind. NASA will return astronauts to the moon in 2028 to establish a permanent presence.
It was a pleasure meeting with leaders of Rafael USA to discuss the developmental work they do for the U.S. Military.
In honor of CTE month, I’d like to highlight the Dallas County Technical Center in #MO4. Over 200 high school students are learning skills ranging from auto mechanics to welding. This program equips today’s students for the workforce of tomorrow! #BisonPride #CTEMonth
(2/2) and I believe there are non-defense areas of the government where it is appropriate to do so. I stand by him on this issue, and I will continue to monitor this solution to ensure it champions national security as well as border security.
(1/2) The president’s emergency declaration today is needed to protect our border from the flow of deadly drugs into our communities. His emergency powers give him the authority to redirect funding to protect the American people,
Today I introduced the VA Hiring Enhancement Act to make the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) more competitive in recruiting top-quality physicians. Great health care depends on great doctors, and America’s veterans deserve the best.
Today I participated in the Annual Congressional Wear Red Day to honor American Heart Month.  Thank you @American_Heart for bringing attention to such an important cause! #HeartMonth
Thank you @Ameriburn for stopping by my D.C. office to inform me of the Military Burn Trauma Research Program and why it is important for our Armed Forces members.
@SFCCPresident @sfccmo @MACC1927 It was a delight to visit with you!  I’m so proud of the good work you all are doing preparing students for good paying jobs in our community! #educationpays

It was a pleasure talking with leaders from Moberly Area Community College and State Fair Community College this afternoon.
Thank you former Congressman Joe Pitts for making the time to stop by my office to talk about the upcoming year for Faith and Law!
I had an informative discussion with Roni Jones from the Alliance for Headache Disorders Advocacy, discussing headache disorder issues.  Thanks for stopping by!
(2/2) We must remain steadfast in our support for Israel, and I stand by @AIPAC and their work on behalf our strongest democratic partner in the Middle East.
(1/2) Deeply concerned by anti-Semitic sentiments that continue to surface within House Dem Caucus. While these extreme views don't represent the party as a whole, they raise serious Qs about Dem leadership’s commitment to Israel as a sovereign state. 
(2/2) Among other things, #GreenNewDeal wants to end air travel and "upgrade" every building in the U.S. The radical left continues to focus on its extreme agenda, once again ignoring the life and death problems America faces (like illegal drugs pouring over border). #NoDeal
(1/2) You can’t make this up. #GreenNewDeal should be called the Green New STEAL → a socialist manifesto that proposes we steal dollars and jobs from hardworking Americans to reward those who are “unwilling to work.”
(2/2) Sex trafficking crimes are a growing epidemic in America that must be dealt with swiftly. Law enforcement needs the necessary tools to protect our families and children, and this bill helps address the problem.
(1/2) Today I introduced H.R. 1110, the Empowering Law Enforcement to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act. This bill would help law enforcement agencies fight sex trafficking demand by giving them access to federal grants through the Edward Byrne Justice Assistance Grants Program.
It was great to speak to members of the @STLRegChamber last night during their visit to Washington.
I enjoyed discussing Tricare for National Guard technicians with the Association of Civilian Technicians Show-Me Chapter.
I had an informative meeting this week with the Midwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program (a part of @DEAHQ) about their efforts to confront the drug epidemic in the Midwest.
It was a pleasure to host the hardworking state senators and representatives in #MO4 district on Monday for my first every Working Together for Missouri Summit. We talked about the intersection between state and federal government and how we can work together to accomplish more.
I enjoyed checking out the cockpit of an F-18 and getting to see the advanced F-15 production line at the @Boeing facility in St. Louis last week.
Inspiring #nationalprayerbreakfast with @christomlin leading worship, Gary Haugen w/ Intl. Justice Mission as Keynote, @POTUS speaking challenging us to not grow weary in doing good whether fighting human trafficking, protecting life, or sharing the love of #Jesus. #endslavery
Today I supported H.R. 66, a bill that would commemorate the centennial anniversary of Route 66, a national treasure that has, for decades, attracted visitors to Missouri from all 50 states and countries around the world. This bill will help us properly celebrate this landmark!
Tonight @POTUS laid out an optimistic agenda to unify our country and move America forward. See full statement below ↓
What were your favorite commercials during the #SuperBowl2019 ?  I liked the Audi w/Grandpa ad, the Amazon ad w/ Harrison Ford his dog, and the @NFL players at a banquet ad. #BestSuperBowlAds
So far @SuperBowl LIII is about as exciting as watching water freeze �️���. Would have been a lot more exciting with the @Chiefs and @Saints ! �
Am wearing my @Chiefs shirt while reluctantly watching the #SuperBowl2019 .  Feel we should be watching a game between the KC Chiefs @Saints ! ����Hope to see some good commercials!
Russia has been violating the INF Treaty for yrs China has built missiles unconstrained. By withdrawing from the outdated INF Treaty, America will be on a needed level playing field to meet today’s strategic threats. #nationaldefense
Yesterday’s extreme sanctions by the @NCAA are unfair and need to be reversed. Read my statement here→ #MIZ #MidMissouri
On Wednesday I was presented with the Legislator of the Year Award by the @akcdoglovers. What an honor!
It was great meeting Johanna Erich, an exchange student from Germany, to discuss her interest in the U.S. legislative process.
This week I had the opportunity to meet with military and veteran advocate Richard Glickstein to discuss the important issues of PTSD and veteran suicide.
Early on Tuesday, I met with @usairforce Secretary Heather Wilson to discuss Air Force priorities. This meeting was especially important because of my new position as ranking member on the Tactical Air Land Forces Subcommittee on the @HASCRepublicans Committee.
Dems said they would negotiate on a border barrier if the government reopened. @POTUS has reopened the govt, but Dems have yet to keep their word → he called their bluff, but we see no #compromise. #SecureOurBorder
I enjoyed meeting with Brian Lehman of the @MissouriCorn Leadership Program to discuss agriculture issues.
Stay warm! ️️
Today at a House Armed Services Committee hearing I spoke to Under Secretary of Defense for Policy John Rood about the urgent problem of drugs pouring through our southern border. #SecureOurBorder
It was great to be able to visit with Dan and Shelia Cockman of Advantage Hearing Aid Center, Inc. in Harrisonville to hear about the great service they are providing to their community.
A big thank you to the Lyme Association Greater Kansas City, Inc for stopping by to discuss how we can work together to raise awareness about #LymeDisease. As a member of the Congressional Lyme Disease Caucus, it is my pleasure to work alongside them on this issue.
According to @DHSgov, the construction of physical barriers has reduced the number of illegal border crossings in multiple states → in San Diego for example, where there has been a border wall since 1992, illegal traffic has dropped 92% over the last 23 years.
I am honored to be selected by @MacTXPress as ranking member of the Tactical Air Land Forces Subcommittee. This new position will compliment the vast military interests of #MO4 and in it, my goal will be to restore the readiness capability of our air and land forces.
It’s a shame @SpeakerPelosi is refusing to consider compromise from @POTUS to reopen govn + ensure Americans' safety + give DREAMERS more certainty. Missed paychecks are devastating to our 800,000 dedicated federal wrkrs, many of whom make less than $50K/year. #compromise
Starting tomorrow, Farm Service Agency (FSA) offices will be open and able to provide additional services for farmers ranchers. Thank you @SecretarySonny @usdafsa employees for your dedication for keeping the promise to "do right and feed everyone."
Today we celebrate a man who consistently stood up for what is just, refused to get discouraged by the odds, and challenged our nation to do what was right even when it was uncomfortable. Happy #MLKDay!
Heartbreaking loss for KC @Chiefs fans � but congrats on a BIG SEASON!  You gave us a lot to cheer for� and made us in Chiefs Territory proud. ���
What an #AFCChampionship !  Go, @Chiefs !!��
Excited to watch the @Chiefs play for the #AFCChampionship!  Will be a legendary game between Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady. I’m cheering for Patrick and the Chiefs!! �
@POTUS offer is reasonable approach to securing our border reopening government. It provides security with a barrier combined w/ tech, canines, more border agents, $800 m humanitarian asst. plus grants new status for #DACA TPS recipients. Senate should pass the compromise!
Thrilled that @POTUS today promised to abstain from signing any legislation that weakens current pro-life federal policies and laws. Letter here →
Our winter interns have been such a help! Pictured from left to right are: Lydia Murphy (a @Mizzou student), myself, Jaclyn McLean (a @LibertyU student), Max Beckert (who is from New Zealand and just finished his Law and Commerce Degrees), and Andrew Blackmore (also at Liberty).
Enjoyed attending a Women of Congress Defense Breakfast this morning w/ Heather Wilson, @SecAFOfficial. Discussed needs of our airmen and new processes in the @usairforce encouraging innovation. Very encouraging. She’s providing great leadership!
I am thankful for our rich, spiritual heritage as we observe #ReligiousFreedomDay. This is a time for celebration and remembrance as we consider communities around the world facing persecution for their faith.
Congratulations to the @cmuniv men’s soccer team on its National Championship. Go Eagles!
“Chief Ortiz’s sector apprehended illegal immigrants from 43 countries other than Mexico or countries in Central America. We absolutely have a crisis at the border… even President Obama said as much in 2014.” - @RepDanNewhouse #SecureOurBorder
“Combined with 21st century surveillance technology and increased border agents, a barrier is an effective defense against criminals, gang members, drug-smugglers, and yes, even terrorists.”- @RepMarkGreen #SecureOurBorder
“I find it hypocritical that Speaker Pelosi has talked about walls being immoral when she has spent half of her life being protected by those very walls.” - @RepArrington #SecureOurBorder
“To curb the flow of drugs into our communities, we must secure our southern border. There’s no doubt we need a comprehensive solution.” - @RepWalberg #SecureOurBorder
“Bottom line: whatever we’re doing for border security isn’t working. We must do more...300 Americans every week are killed by heroin, and 90% of that heroin comes across that southern border.” - @RepRickAllen #SecureOurBorder
“It’s a humanitarian and national security crisis. It’s been ignored for far too long… Kate Steinle, killed in San Francisco with her family, Jamiel Shaw from southern California, needlessly killed.... all mowed down by illegal immigrants.” - @RepLaMalfa #SecureOurBorder
“We are in the midst of a crisis on our southern border and it’s time for our colleagues across the aisle to stop playing politics and focus on our national security.” - @RepCarolMiller #SecureOurBorder
Update: I will speak on the Floor at approximately 7:10 ET
Tune into @CSPAN around 7:30 pm ET tonight to hear what my House colleagues and I have to say about border security. #SecureOurBorder
I appreciate the dedicated lineman working to restore power after the big #2019snow!! ️️. I also appreciate the snow plow operators and first responders helping those who have slid off the road. #besafe
Go @Chiefs !! Will be watching from home and cheering for a BIG WIN over the Colts today!! �
Today I supported a bill to pay all federal workers affected by the partial govt shutdown at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends. Inaction by Congress to solve our border issues should not result in causing some federal workers to go without pay.
Tonight I had the opportunity to speak on the House floor about the urgent issue our open border presents, and how it is hurting Americans and communities here at home and immigrants who fall prey to traffickers. #SecureOurBorder
In wake of the partial government shutdown, today I requested that the House Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) withhold my Congressional pay “until an appropriation agreement to fund the entire government has taken effect.” The CAO has granted my request.
On @POTUS's speech last night, I agree: open borders have caused lives of loved ones to be stolen, women children to be victimized by traffickers, drugs to be leaked into MO communities. Submitting to the status quo is hurting our American way of life it can't continue.
Privileged to hear from @vp about the humanitarian and border security crisis why we need to address both ASAP. @POTUS is negotiating in good faith. It’s time for the democrats to do the same. #ProtectOurFamilies. #StopDrugs
Glad @POTUS is going to address the American people tonight about the #BorderCrisis. It’s imperative we stop the drugs pouring into our communities which kill our kids. Plus we need to ensure immigration laws are followed our families are kept safe. It’s time to #BuildTheWall.
RT @FRCdc: .@RepHartzler identifies the major problem with the Democrat’s funding bill, that it strips away essential protections for young…
The economy continues its strong performance, adding 312,000 jobs this month. Unemployment is at an 18 year low. Good things happen when we roll back burdensome government regulations.
Today the Democrat majority in the House advanced bills that fail to address our rapidly growing border problems. Their bills ignore the need for increased border security kick the can down the road, advocating for the failed status quo that first caused this predicament.
Today I was sworn into my fifth term as U.S. Congresswoman for the 4th District of Missouri. I am honored to once again have the opportunity to serve and represent the people of #MO4. It is a privilege to be their voice and to fight for our shared values and common sense ideas.
So proud of the men women of @Whiteman_AFB who enabled the #B2Bomber to kick off the @RoseParade! Awesome!
Happy New Year! May you have a blessed 2019.
Excited my @Mizzou Tigers� are playing in the #LibertyBowl today!  �Looking for a BIG WIN over Oklahoma State!  Go, Tigers!! ��
In a world that often is full of bad news, it's refreshing to remember angels delivered a message of “Good News.” I’m so grateful for it. I hope you get to celebrate the birth of Jesus this Christmas with friends family and experience His love presence throughout the year.
(2/2) I encourage Democrats to support legislation that funds our government prioritizes our security by increasing funding to protect our border, stops flow of deadly drugs into our communities, stems tide of illegal immigration. I stand by, ready to support such a measure.
(1/2) On December 20 I voted for a CR to fund entire govt through February 7, that included much needed border security funding for @DHSgov while also funding other select federal agencies. Unfortunately, the Senate did not reach the required sixty votes necessary to approve it.
Pleased to support the First Step Act that @POTUS just signed into law → this bill works to reduce recidivism and give certain non-violent prisoners a second chance when they reenter society. Great step in the right direction.
I fully support @SteveDaines call to fund government #BuildTheWall by changing the unconstitutional 60-vote filibuster rule in the Senate. The American people gave us the Majority. We need to quit squandering this opportunity to fulfill their wishes. #MajorityRules
Pretty shot of Capitol I took tonight after voting to build the wall, provide disaster relief, and fund our government. We must stop the drug cartels from bringing drugs into our country which kill our kids. Calling on Senate to pass it tomorrow. #bordersecurity #stopdrugcartels
.@POTUS continues his promise of supporting Missourians and agriculturalists across our country by signing the bipartisan #2018FarmBill into law today. Pics below of our signing the bill before it went to the President.
Pleased that last night the House moved to authorize $20 million annually for Alzheimer’s research and prevention. Especially meaningful since my own mom passed away from Alzheimer’s complications in 2015.
Witnessed a great speech by a great American @speakerryan.  He reflected on accomplishments challenged us to lift our gaze tackle the challenges yet before us. I’m thankful I had the privilege of serving w/ him wish he his family well in next chpt of life.#farewelladdress
We need to #BuildTheWall!  I’ve visited the border seen the danger. Cartels are bringing billions of $ of drugs across our open border which come to our communities kill our kids. This must stop! #SafetyFirst #FundTheWall
I enjoyed making Christmas � sugar #cookies this afternoon with Tiffany!! Now it feels like #christmas! ��We’re going to have fun sharing them with friends and family eating them!��#seasonofgiving
Wishing a very happy 382nd birthday to the @USNationalGuard today!
Thank you for everyone’s kind remarks and support. It means a lot. ️
@bobvansandt Thank you, Robert.
House passage of the #2018FarmBill conference report today provides much needed certainty for producers and consumers alike. While we didn't achieve all that we wanted in the final version, this legislation is a positive step for farmers, ranchers, consumers and rural America.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Thank you, Andy.
Today my Daddy, Ted Zellmer, went to heaven. � I will miss him but am so thankful I had all these years with him. What a gift. � During his life he raised lIvestock�, crops�, a church, and 2 daughters who love God, love others, and love our country. �� What a #blessing.��
After months of working with fellow conferees on behalf of rural America, I am proud to sign the #2018FarmBill and provide much needed certainty for producers and consumers both in Missouri and across our nation.
Pleased the House voted last night to make common-sense reforms for our nation's veterans and servicemembers, S. 2248, the Veterans Benefit and Transition Act of 2018. We need to strengthen the way we care for those who have served and those who still serve our country today.
Pleased to announce that @POTUS signed into law the bill I authored to rename the downtown Columbia Post Office in honor of MO fallen soldier Spc. Sterling Wyatt. Sterling’s service to his country set an amazing example to the rest of our nation, and he is worthy of this honor.
Today marks 77 years since the attack on our naval base at Pearl Harbor in 1941. Take a look at these iconic pictures of that infamous day and take a moment to remember the 2,400 American lives that were lost.
I applaud the @USDOL's recent actions to allow groups, associations, and sole proprietors to sign up for association health plans (AHPs). This is a great option for qualifying families seeking more affordable health insurance →
Congratulations to the @cmueagles men’s soccer team for winning the 2018 @NAIA National Championship!
Honored to participate in the Reagan Defense Forum at the @Reagan_Library looking at ways to build “Peace Through Strength in an Era of Competiton”.  Unique opportunity to hear from defense leaders from DOD, industry, Congress, civilian leaders. #defense #RNDF2018
Good luck to the @LHS_Cardinals today as they play for the Missouri Class 1 football championship! #MO4football
(2/2) America has lost a true statesman. My thoughts and prayers are with the Bush family at this time.
(1/2) I was saddened to learn of the news that President George H.W. Bush had passed. “Bush 41,” as he was affectionately known, served his country in WWII as a combat pilot, then as an envoy to China, U.S. Representative, CIA Director, VP, and finally President of the U.S.
@RepKevinYoder @sharicedavids You’re a class act, Kevin. We are going to miss you!
Congrats to @WayTigerPR school district on receiving $1.25M federal grant from @DeptofDefense to fund their Educating our Digital Generation Effectively program! The  #EDGE program will allow Waynesville R-VI students to grow into the digital age with robotics and #STEM programs.
I’m pleased with @POTUS’s signing today of the #USMCA → We are moving in the right direction in providing certainty for our farmers, consumers, businesses and workers across the nation.
Today I sat with @CatholicRelief to discuss funding for our international assistance programs, particularly those focused on food security and nutrition.
I enjoyed talking with the Missouri Alliance for Homecare today about senior access to home care.
.@TheHill published my editorial detailing what I saw when I visited our border and how I believe we can help our border agents manage the situation there
Happy Thanksgiving! This year I'm thankful for the Lord's faithfulness, my family, our men women in uniform, that our economy is doing well.  And, as always, I'm grateful for the opportunity to represent each every one of the good people of #MO4. What are you thankful for?
Happy to announce that Katy Trail Community Health, which includes #MO4 clinics in Sedalia, Versailles and Warsaw, was awarded $3.5M Health Center Program continuation grant (authorized by Medicare Access CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which Congress passed I supported).
Amazing you could score 51 points and not win but proud of the great effort of the Kansas City @Chiefs !  History making game. � @NFL_MNF

Adoption is a wonderful way God makes a family! Happy #NationalAdoptionDay
It's been an honor to serve alongside my colleague across the aisle, Madeleine Bordallo, as co-chair of the Long Range Strike Caucus. Rep. Bordallo has been a strong advocate for the @usairforce bomber fleet and will truly be missed. Thank you for your friendship #HafaAdai
I had the opportunity to sit down with Sherrie Laurie, the Executive Director of Hope Center in downtown Anchorage to discuss the successes and trials of her organization which feeds the homeless during the day, and doubles as a battered women’s shelter at night.
Had a great meeting yesterday with Missouri’s Procurement Technical Assistance Program, which has helped create or retain an estimated 87,000 jobs in the Show Me State.
Sobered grateful to visit with Explosive Ordnance Disposal specialists at the EOD Day on the Hill event. These courageous warriors protect their fellow soldiers by taking out IED’s that maim and kill. Am thankful for their service. #bomb #courage
The Show Me State’s unemployment in October tied for a record low at 3.1%! Seasonal employment also went up by 6,000 from September to October. #FridayFeeling
Pleased to announce Senate passed my bill to name Columbia, MO post office in honor of Missouri-born Spc. Sterling Wyatt, who was killed by an IED blast in 2012. His name is etched into our post office will inspire future generations commemorate his patriotism forever.
As part of Missouri's capitol renovation project, the statue of Ceres is being removed from the building this morning for restoration. She is symbolic of the agriculture that drives the Show Me State, has been on top of the Capitol for 94 years, and measures 10-foot, 4-inches �
So excited that Trinity Lutheran Church is opening its new playground with the federal grant money it rightly deserved. I was proud to write an amicus brief in the church's support when this case went before SCOTUS.
After church I stopped by our doughboy statute at the Harrisonville courthouse to remember the 53 Cass Countians who gave their lives during #WWI to commemorate the 100th Anniversary of the end of the war. Sober reminder that #freedom isn’t free. Grateful for all who went.
Grateful that today marks 100 years since the end of the First World War.
I want to extend a heartfelt "Thank You" today to all of the men and women who have faithfully served our country. We owe our freedoms to you. Thank you for your service and sacrifice. God bless you and happy Veterans Day!
Had a great conversation with a wonderful group of Adrian High School students to discuss the #opioidcrisis #DrugFreeMissouri
Thank you @Walmart for letting me stop by the Walmart pharmacy in Butler, MO to learn more about their commitment to doing their part in ending the #opioidcrisis
