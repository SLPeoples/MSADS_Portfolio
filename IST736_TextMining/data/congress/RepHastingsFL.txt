Investment in girls’ education isn’t just the right thing to do—it’s the smart thing to do. When 10% more girls go to school, a country’s GDP increases on average by 3%. #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2019
The U.S.-Israel relationship must not be turned into a partisan wedge issue. There is not, and can never be, a “pro-Israel” party. Every person who recognizes the importance of the U.S.-Israel relationship must speak out when @RealDonaldTrump makes comments like this.
This ruling delivered justice to the family of Corey Jones. While nothing will bring Corey back, we hope this decision brings comfort to his family friends in knowing that justice has been served. Please see our full joint statement below.

It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of my friend and colleague, Congressman Walter B. Jones. My thoughts and prayers go out to Joe Anne, Ashley, and his entire family. Our nation grieves with them for the loss of such a respected man and talented legislator.
As one of the co-chairs of the Democratic Israel Working Group, I work hard to educate my colleagues about the importance of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. Here is an op-ed I wrote on the subject at the end of last year:
The line between respectful critiques of American foreign policy and the embrace of anti-Semitic tropes is not difficult to distinguish. Implying that Americans support Israel and the Jewish community because of money is offensive and cannot be tolerated.
I was deeply saddened to hear of the passing of the legendary Frank Robinson. He was, will continue to be, an inspirational role model for all ballplayers, perhaps most especially for minority players. His contributions to MLB our nation will forever be ingrained in history.
The world and our country have lost a dear friend to so many. I offer my deepest condolences to John’s beloved wife, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, and the entire Dingell family. Chairman Dingell was a remarkable man, and his legacy will no doubt live on for generations to come.

The nonpartisan CBO projects that @RealDonaldTrump’s reckless #GovernmentShutdown cost our country $11 billion, including $3 billion that will never be recovered. Now, Trump is threatening another shutdown, adding new uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of federal employees.
Praying for my friend and longtime colleague @RepWalterJones and his family, during this very difficult time. He has always served his constituents and our nation with honor and principle.
On this day, we remember the six million Jews who perished at the hands of the Nazi regime. My statement on #HolocaustRemembranceDay: 
The President announced that he would sign the clean spending bill that  Democrats have advocated for since this pointless shutdown began 35 days ago. The Trump shutdown will go down in history for needlessly putting hundreds of thousands of American families in peril.
Federal workers aren't responsible for the shutdown, yet they're paying the price. I’m proud to join Rep. @Ilhan in introducing the Federal Worker Childcare Protection Act of 2019. Federal workers w/ children must be reimbursed for childcare expenses incurred during the shutdown.
Paul Manafort, Michael Cohen, George Papadopoulos, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn... now Roger Stone. That makes 5 former Trump advisors who pleaded guilty so far. Stone is the latest in Mueller's rapidly closing investigation into @POTUS Russian meddling.

My heart breaks for the Sebring community. My prayers go out to the  families who sadly lost loved ones to this senseless act of violence. This is the 7th mass shooting in our state in just 3 short years. Congress needs to pass sensible gun control legislation to #EndGunViolence.
This Administration is so out of touch it literally does not understand what federal workers are going through. Donald Trump continues to hold the pay of hundreds of thousands of people hostage, harming our entire country. #EndTheShutdown
The WH Economic Advisor called the shutdown a “free vacation,” saying “in some sense [federal employees] are better off.”
Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross (a billionaire) says he “doesn’t understand” why federal employees who haven’t gotten paid in more than a month have to go to food banks.
Iran cannot be allowed to permanently entrench its military in Syria. The United States will continue to support Israel’s right to defend itself.
On Sunday, Iranian forces in Syria fired a surface-to-surface missile towards Mount Hermon in Israel. At the time, thousands of Israelis were in the area at the Hermon ski resort. Thankfully, the missile was intercepted by the Iron Dome, preventing a major escalation.
I wrote the Government Accountability Office urging them to examine the effects of the President’s trade tariffs on our nation’s ability to take the lead on 5G technology. With the potential to create 3M new jobs boost the economy by $500B, 5G must be a priority.
While thousands of federal workers remain furloughed, Air Traffic Controllers, Coast Guardsmen, TSA Agents, and many others continue to work unpaid. They do this country a great service, but they are quickly reaching a breaking point.
Each day that passes brings new uncertainty for hundreds of thousands of families falling deeper into crisis. Last night, while chairing a meeting of the House Rules Committee, I took a moment to highlight some of the impacts of the shutdown in and around my district.
In two days, hundreds of thousands of American workers across the country will miss another paycheck. President Trump’s stubborn refusal to open the government has left our country weaker and our national security increasingly compromised.
Two years ago today, the Trump Administration attacked women’s reproductive rights by reinstating the #GlobalGagRule. It is time to end this unnecessary and harmful policy that prevents women from receiving life-saving healthcare.
The 24th Amendment was ratified 55 years ago today, abolishing the use of a poll tax as a pre-condition for voting in federal elections. Equal access to the voting booth is a fundamental part of our democracy. Every citizen should have the opportunity to be heard.
Yesterday’s Supreme Court decision allows the Trump Administration to discriminate against transgender service members. We should be thanking these brave Americans for their service, not casting them aside as secondary citizens.

After one month, the #TrumpShutdown is still putting hardworking Americans in dire situations – so @realDonaldTrump can try to force the American people to pay for his expensive ineffective border wall. #EndTheShutdown
One month into the #TrumpShutdown, the President claims he forced the shutdown to keep Americans safe. But with federal law enforcement and our homeland security community (Coast Guard, FBI, DEA and more) going without pay, he’s only harming security. #EndTheShutdown

Each of us has a responsibility to foster tolerance and work to level the playing field so that each American family can live with dignity. I join in celebrating Dr. King’s legacy today as we continue the hard work of transforming our country into the place we know it should be.
@POTUS and @Senatemajldr continue to withhold the pay of 800,000 civil servants, effectively taking their financial security hostage. The typical worker has missed more than $5,000 in pay. End the #TrumpShutdown
On day 29 of the #TrumpShutdown, over 800,000 civil servants are on the precipice of going a month without pay. On top of this, @POTUS has ordered thousands back to work without pay, an egregious abuse of his executive powers.
Our shelters in Palm Beach County are already struggling. @POTUS and @SenateMajldr have put more lives at stake.
It is day 28 of the #TrumpShutdown and domestic violence shelters that rely on federal funding will soon need to shut their doors and turn off their hotlines due to lost funding.
Last month @POTUS traveled to Iraq during the #TrumpShutdown, yet he chose to play politics and endanger the lives of American citizens. This recklessness is shocking, even for the President.
As a co-equal branch of government Congress has the constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight. It is vital that we understand the risks and objectives when we ask our servicemembers to put their lives on the line overseas.
By leaking the details of @SpeakerPelosi’s trip to Afghanistan, @POTUS endangered the lives of members of the delegation, officials supporting the trip, civilians on the flight, and our servicemembers.
I was proud to join Congressman Correa and dozens of our colleagues to introduce legislation to protect #DREAMERS, refugees, and immigrants from deportation. House Democrats refuse to allow @POTUS’ xenophobic policies to tear apart more families.

Vacating the vote on the continuing resolution in order to allow Republican members to record their votes electronically should be taken as a sign that Democrats are serious about governing more fairly.
President Trump shut the government down 27 days ago and Democrats have been trying to reopen it ever since. The House just voted for the ninth time to open the government. The Senate has not voted once since the shutdown began.
Those of us who care about Haiti and its’ diaspora know that it remains on the road to recovery. That’s why I’m proud to introduce the Haitian Educational Empowerment Act to help revitalize Haiti’s future.

The #GovernmentShutdown is about to stretch into week 4. The Trump Administration has begun forcing thousands of workers to report to work without pay in order to minimize the fallout with Trump’s political base. This is an alarming abuse of power. #EndTheShutdown
I am tired of the Senate’s inability to do their job and reopen the government. @SenateMajldr has not held a single vote this year to end the shutdown. It’s time to stop playing games with 800,000 federal employees and our nation’s security. #EndTheShutdown
This is heartbreaking news. Prayers for the families of those brave service members injured or killed in this terrible attack, and for the civilians in Syria whose lives continue to be devastated by terrorism and war.
Today I join @BobbyScott, @SpeakerPelosi, House Senate Leadership to introduce the #RaiseTheWage Act. By raising the minimum wage to a #LivingWage of $15, we would provide over 40 million Americans with a long overdue raise and lift millions out of poverty. #Fightfor15
It’s been nearly 10 years since the Federal Minimum Wage was increased. At $7.25 an hour, that’s just $15,000 a year for a full-time worker. It’s time to give millions of Americans a raise. Proud to support the #RaiseTheWage Act
While we are in the business of condemning hate speech, Republican leadership should also repudiate President Trump’s long history of racial divisiveness, including equivocating on white nationalism.
Yesterday, I voted with 424 of my colleagues to condemn white supremacy and white nationalism. We must never hesitate to condemn racism of every form. Stoking racial divisions, as Congressman King has done for years, cannot be tolerated. It is time the House pushed back.
House votes to open the government in 2019: 7Senate votes to open the government in 2019: 0The Republican-controlled Senate has not voted a single time to open the government since the shutdown began. We know who is keeping this government closed.
The #TrumpShutdown has lasted 25 days. Today, the Administration announced that the cost of the shutdown will be twice as expensive as original forecast, and is on track to cost our country $5 billion. @RealDonaldTrump: it’s time to stop acting like a child and end the shutdown.

The Mueller Investigation has implicated 30+ people, many working for the President. Meanwhile, @POTUS's shocking attempts to conceal his talks with Russian Pres. Putin beg the question- is the President on the side of the American people or Russia? 
The Republican Senate overwhelmingly passed bipartisan funding legislation that would have avoided a shutdown, including significant funding for effective border security. The House has passed nearly identical language. @POTUS needs to end this charade and open the government!
Continuing to hold out with no path forward is not leadership, its brinksmanship. The President has back himself into a corner and is causing long-term, possibly irrevocable harm to our country.
Government websites are vulnerable. Food inspections have stopped. Hurricane preparations have stopped.  Airport safety is increasingly compromised. National Parks are being permanently damaged.
Federal employees are at risk of losing their cars, their homes, missing payments for medications, education, or other bills. Coast Guardsmen were advised to sell their possessions and others to trade chores for rent.
@RealDonaldTrump continues to make history for all the wrong reasons. The government shutdown has entered day 24, the longest shutdown in the history of our country. This wound is entirely self-inflicted by the President, and we need to hold him accountable.
I was pleased to join @USRepKCastor in urging @GovRonDeSantis @AGAshleyMoody to expand Medicaid help protect FL families and people with pre-existing conditions. The State of Florida must be removed from the dangerous lawsuit attacking the Affordable Care Act. #ProtectOurCare
Democrats continue to support smart effective border security. The border wall is neither. There is no reason for President Trump Senate Majority Leader McConnell to keep government shuttered for an ineffective, wasteful wall. End the temper tantrum; open the government now!
After implementing tariffs, the Trump Administration offered more than $12B as a lifeline to farmers. Due to the shutdown, those checks aren’t coming. Farmers are hurting, food safety inspections have halted. @POTUS is holding our health safety hostage
Today, on day 21 of the Trump Shutdown, 800,000 federal workers, including over 13,000 Floridians, will not get their paychecks. @RealDonaldTrump cares more about building a wall than protecting American families. He has people across the country in jeopardy. #EndtheShutdown
On Day One of the Democratically-controlled House, we passed Senate Republican legislation to end the #TrumpShutdown, re-open government, secure our borders. Democrats are working #ForThePeople, it’s time for the President to do the same.

The President is continuing to put his radical demands above the American people. 800,000 federal workers – including over 13,000 Floridians – will miss their first paycheck if the President doesn’t end his senseless shutdown in two days.
Meanwhile, it’s Day 19 of the #TrumpShutdown …
ICYMI, the President just stormed out of discussions with Democratic leaders to re-open the government, calling it a “total waste of time.” Another temper-tantrum by this President holding millions of American families hostage…
Last night, @POTUS spoke of a humanitarian crisis “of the heart” and “of the soul.” Today, he threatened to cut off 40M Americans from emergency disaster relief. In threatening victims to win political points, Trump is again demonstrating his inability to govern with compassion.
The President can reopen the government tonight by supporting bipartisan funding bills that have passed the House and received overwhelming support in the Republican Senate. Instead, he continues to grandstand. This isn’t leadership; it’s a ransom demand.
I am grateful to @SpeakerPelosi and the Democratic leadership team for appointing me Vice Chairman of @RulesDemocrats and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Legislative and Budget Process. I look forward to working with @RepMcGovern to institute a fair and democratic process.
Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence. That’s not a pattern – that’s an epidemic. Congress has to step up pass #HR8 so we can get some commonsense, bipartisan solutions in place.
If you can’t pass a background check, you shouldn’t be able to buy a gun. It’s just that simple. #HR8
Today - 8 years since Rep. @GabbyGiffords 18 other people were shot in Tucson, AZ - Democrats will introduce a bipartisan bill to expand background checks for sales transfers of firearms. Gun violence has absolutely no place in our communities.
Day 18 of the #GovernmentShutdown. The President is still holding the well-being of the American people hostage, including over 13,000 FL families not receiving their paychecks. @POTUS should reopen the government support effective border security solutions, not a wasteful wall
It is with a heavy heart that I learned of the passing of Edith Schaffer Lederberg. She touched so many lives and left an indelible mark on Broward County. My deepest condolences go out to the Lederberg family during this time of great sadness. May she rest in peace.
As the government shutdown stretches into week 3, more than 800k federal employees are furloughed or working without pay. @RealDonaldTrump also ordered a pay freeze for most federal employees for 2019. Senior Trump Administration officials, however, are about to get pay raises.
Yesterday, I signed my oath of office for the 116th Congress.
I’m pleased to join @RepJerryNadler, @JacksonLeeTX18, @RepCohen 100+ Members in re-introducing the Special Counsel Independence Integrity Act. It's time for Congress to act swiftly to protect the independence of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation uphold the rule of law
In honor of #MentoringMonth, I would like to acknowledge all of the organizations and individuals doing powerful mentoring work to change the lives of young people. Thank your mentors help inspire others to join the mentoring movement at #MentorIRL
Today, as one of my first actions in the 116th Congress, I worked with my colleagues in the Democratically-controlled House of Representatives to pass legislation that would reopen the federal government in entirety.
I am pleased to mark the beginning of the 116th Congress by reintroducing the Build America Act. This bill will significantly expand funding for two infrastructure grant programs paving the way for billions of dollars of investments nationwide every year.
Federal employees are hurting under @RealDonaldTrump’s 3rd government shutdown. I am proud to join @RepDonBeyer today to introduce legislation that will provide furloughed workers with back pay once this disastrous Republican shutdown ends.
As incoming Chairman of the U.S. @HelsinkiComm, I will work to combat  toxic rhetoric that promotes fear-mongering and anti-migrant policies. I  am proud to have Rep. @JacksonLeeTX18, @RepGregoryMeeks, @RepGwenMoore  and other Members of the Commission as partners in this effort.
The United States must work together with our European partners to promote a future in which racially and ethnically diverse populations are celebrated and guaranteed fundamental human rights.
Today, the 116th Congress convenes with the new Democratic House taking swift action to pass two bills to reopen the government after a second week of the #TrumpShutdown. Democrats are ready to deliver an agenda that is #ForThePeople on day one!
Here is my end of the year report on everything I worked on during the 115th Congress: As the 116th Congress convenes, I look forward to continuing to advocate for our community in the days, weeks, and months ahead!
@RealDonaldTrump has dragged his 3rd government shutdown into day 12. Tomorrow, the Democratic Majority will vote to reopen the government put an end to this partisan grandstanding. The President Senate should join us in ending this manufactured crisis.
5 years ago today, the ACA brought an end to insurance companies being able to discriminate against people who have preexisting conditions. So many people were denied basic coverage, but Obamacare changed that. We can’t go back to the old days.
Wishing all a Happy New Year filled with good health, prosperity, and joy. There is so much to be thankful for, and so many challenges ahead of us. I look forward to getting to work for all Floridians and our nation as the 116th Congress gets underway.
@RealDonaldTrump: It’s shameful that you politicize the deaths of migrant children in our custody without any compassion or humanity. Our values compel us to protect children, not promote reckless policies that needlessly endanger their wellbeing.
Congrats @USRepKCastor on being appointed Chair of the new Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. I look forward to working together in the 116th Congress to fight climate change, protect our environment, promote public health, create green jobs ensure a sustainable future.
One by one, Trump’s most capable and independent advisors are quitting. Soon, the President will have no professional policy experts by his side, only politically-minded sycophants unwilling to challenge him. This should alarm everyone.
His resignation letter reads, “My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held," contrasting Trump’s nonchalant approach to America’s leadership across the globe.
Secretary Mattis is a steadying voice against the worst political whims of the Trump Administration. While he was not always successful, he is nevertheless a professional who understands the nuances of leadership.
These decorated soldiers served our nation with honor and distinction. I offer my heartfelt condolences to their families and loved ones during this difficult time.
Last night, I led my colleagues in the House of Representatives in observing a moment of silence in memory of the service members who perished during the U.S. Marine Corps training exercise on December 5, 2018 off the coast of Japan.
The President’s abrupt decision to withdraw troops from Syria despite a number of unresolved pressing national security matters is extremely troubling. Abdicating American leadership in Syria, leaving Russia Iran to assert themselves uncontested, is not in our best interests.
My bill, #HR160 would end this barbaric practice for good. I intend to reintroduce it in the 116th Congress and work with @EdWorkforceDems to make it a priority for House Democrats.
Researchers have found that black students, boys and disabled students continue to be physically punished at a greater rate than their classmates.
Corporal punishment has no place in public schools but is still legal in 19 states. More than 100K students were physically punished last year, being hit, slapped, and spanked.
The epidemic of gun violence is growing. In 2017, there were nearly 40,000 gun deaths in the United States, the highest in decades. We cannot hope to prevent future school shootings without confronting the role of guns in gun violence. (5/5)
By continuing to ignore the overwhelming evidence and embracing policies that don’t make students safer, @RealDonaldTrump is trying to turn the keys to our public schools over to the gun lobby. The Administration is using our children to drive its reckless agenda. (4/5)
Rather than emphasizing proven methods for preventing shootings from ever taking place - such as anti-bullying programs, mental health support, culturally responsive practices, the School Safety Commission Report focuses on the moment a shooter is on campus. (3/5)
Even worse, Secretary DeVos is using the report as an opportunity to push a radial effort to rescind anti-discrimination protections in schools, falsely blaming shootings on “discipline.” (2/5)
The Federal School Safety Commission Report released today reads as if it was written by NRA lobbyists. Rather than address key drivers of school shootings – easy access to handguns and assault-style weapons – it proposes putting more guns in schools and arming teachers. (1/5)
Friday’s absurd court ruling follows 70+ failed attempts by Congressional Republicans to dismantle the ACA 2 SCOTUS rulings upholding the law. Dismantling life-saving protections that help children, seniors, those with pre-existing conditions is not in America's best interest
“Nearly 40,000 people in the United States died by guns last year, marking the highest number of gun deaths in decades.” I’ll never understand those who place a higher value on guns than human life. @HouseDemocrats will pass gun control next year. The Senate must follow suit.
Today marks six years since the tragic #SandyHook shooting claiming the innocent lives of 20 children and six educators. Let us remember the families who lost loved ones and renew our commitment to bring safety back to our schools and end #gunviolence.
The President's conflicting comments on the National Climate Assessment exhibit his lack of knowledge concern on issues pertaining to the environment. I have joined my colleagues in urging @POTUS to remain committed to the Paris Agreement enforce clean air water safeguards.
I commend the House's passage of a strong, bipartisan Farm Bill that includes support for farmers, life-saving programs like SNAP, conservation efforts, important animal welfare provisions such as the Dog Cat Meat Trade Prohibition Act, which I have been proud to champion.
Secretary Pompeo is continuing to undermine our intelligence community and the very agency that he once led.  It is time for the President to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the brutal murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The #DirtyWaterRule will cancel Clean Water Act protections for the streams that feed drinking water sources for tens of millions of people. We can't let that happen. We must #ProtectCleanWater
With the #DirtyWaterRule, the President is moving to undo decades of bipartisan protection for clean water, putting our health and outdoors at risk of more toxic pollution! #ProtectCleanWater
Despite huge public support for commonsense protections for clean water, President Trump chooses  to side with dirty energy polluters over scientists, our health, and the environment with his #DirtyWaterRule. We can't allow it to move forward. #ProtectCleanWater
I implore @POTUS to put politics aside and rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement.
