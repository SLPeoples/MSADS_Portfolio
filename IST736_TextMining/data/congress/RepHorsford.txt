This morning I joined the CSN Women’s Alliance and Dr. @SondaCosgrove at the Status of Women Symposium to discuss ways to prevent the incarceration of women. I’m looking forward to working with them to pass legislation that funds effective, community based programming.

#HR1 is a critical piece of our #ForThePeople agenda. It reduces the role of special interest money in politics, improves access to the ballot box, and restores integrity in Washington -- a change long overdue for America.
Headed to the House Floor to vote for #HR1 to break big money’s grip on our politics and get government back to working #ForThePeople.
Tomorrow, the House will vote on #HR1 to get big money out of politics and demand a government that works #ForThePeople.

I’m continuing to celebrate #WomensHistoryMonth by recognizing the new women of the 116th Congress. I’m grateful to serve alongside @RepKatiePorter. @HouseDemocrats are lucky to be able to tap her consumer advocate expertise as we implement our #ForThePeople agenda.

This past week, I voted to protect $97 million in funding for servicemembers at Nellis, Creech, the NLV National Guard Center. Congress just put more than $1 billion towards smart, effective border security. Our troops shouldn't pay the price for a non-emergency at the border.
It is moving to see so many freshmen legislators like @RepLoriTrahan leading the country with such passion. She has a shared vision for affordable education and the preservation of our country’s wild life. #WomensHistoryMonth
Among the amazing women making history in the 116th Congress is @RepDebHaaland, one of the first Native American women elected to Congress. I am proud to stand beside her. #WomensHistoryMonth
During #WomensHistoryMonth I want to recognize the brave women in Congress who fight #ForThePeople everyday. @RepWexton has been a leading figure in the fight for affordable prescription drugs.
150 years ago today, Nevada became the first state in the Union to ratify the 15th Amendment giving freedman the right to vote. I am personally ensuring that historic achievement is forever inscribed in the Congressional Record.

#TeamHorsford was part of the packed house at last night’s @nevadadot discussion on the Centennial Bowl and reducing traffic woes across the Valley.
I was honored to join @RepLucyMcBath after yesterday’s House passage of #HR8. She tragically lost her son Jordan to gun violence in 2012. And she’s worked tirelessly to spare others from feeling the same pain. Thank you, Lucy for your life-saving advocacy.
This week, the House passed legislation to reduce gun violence and save lives across our country. I’m grateful to the Nevadans who fought to get these life-saving bills passed.
I lost my father to gun violence when I was 19. I voted for #HR8 today to help spare others that same pain. Grateful to @RepThompson for his leadership on this lifesaving legislation.
For too long, Congress has refused to pass common-sense legislation to #EndGunViolence and save lives. Glad to see that end today with #HR8.

Today, I voted to protect Nevada’s outdoor recreation economy and permanently reauthorize the #LWCF that has invested more than $100 million in Nevada parks and #PublicLands .
Nearly 90% of the state of Nevada consists of #PublicLands and we want to keep them protected. Today I’m voting YES to ensure that #LWCF can keep protecting sites across Nevada for future generations.
After 250 years of fighting for the right to vote, our democratic rights are still under threat. I’m joining @RepTerriSewell to introduce the #VRAA because it’s time for Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE!

Sending birthday wishes to @RepDarrenSoto.  Looking forward to working with you and @NRDems to protect our environment and safeguard tribal rights.
I’m co-sponsoring legislation to help Nevadans dealing with surprise bill tax bills from the IRS. If you’re a Nevadan worried about your refund, let my office know at #WheresMyRefund
It was a pleasure stopping by. Thank you for your work to help youth in our community.
“This is how change happens” - Asha Jones. I couldn’t have said it better. You reflect so much of the change we need to see. Congratulations on a most fitting profile. Your courage, tenacity and dedication is inspiring. 
Nevadans count on their tax refunds to handle large expenses and put money away for emergencies.  If the GOP tax plan is messing with your refund, please tell me how at #WheresMyRefund
I’m proud to co-sponsor this resolution to protect nearly $97 million in military construction projects at #NV04’s Nellis and Creech Air Force Bases and North Las Vegas' National Guard Readiness Center.

I’m grateful for the leadership of @GovSisolak, @AaronDFordNV, @Katkinson702, @JasonFrierson and the courageous legislators who voted yes, for respecting the will of Nevada voters and passing this life-saving legislation.
Yesterday, I joined @WhipClyburn and religious nonprofit leaders to introduce legislation to #StopTheTaxHike on charities and places of worship. Nevada’s nonprofits shouldn’t foot the bill for the Republican tax giveaways to the wealthy.
But I remain focused on addressing issues in #NV04 from lowering the cost of prescription drugs to preventing gun violence, to growing the economy, and raising wages for middle class families.
The President's unconstitutional action threatens to take money away from construction at Nellis Air Force Base, and local national security activities that keep Nevada families safe. I will support the House’s actions to restore order and protect Nevadans.
Wishing a very happy birthday to @WaysMeansCmte Chairman @RepRichardNeal. Grateful for your continued efforts to protect Americans’ retirement security and access to quality, affordable health care.
I’m taking time today to remember the 17 Americans who lost their lives in Parkland, Florida on 2.14.18 . We owe it to them to pass stronger, common-sense gun laws that help us avert these heartbreaking tragedies. #MSDStrong

Thank you, @GovSisolak. Glad that NV leaders in Carson City and Washington are taking action on this important issue.
On Saturday, I hosted a round table discussion on universal background checks with @MomsDemand, community leaders, and Southern Nevadans who have lost loved ones to gun violence. #HR8 will save lives, and I’m proud to co-sponsor this bipartisan legislation.

@sarob75 Couldn’t agree more @sarob75. Universal background checks will save lives. That’s why I’m a proud co-sponsor of #HR8.
Great chatting with @JDavidCoxSr last night. @AFGENational does so much to protect government employees. My bill to reimburse federal workers for the late fees and interest they’re charged during government shutdowns should make that job a little easier.
We should have ratified the #ERA in 1788. But I’ll settle for 2019. I’m ready to work with @NevadaNOW to get it done!
Yesterday, I introduced legislation to ensure federal workers are paid back for the fees, fines interest that pile up during shutdowns. Under this bill, Nevadans won't have to foot the bill for Washington's dysfunction.
Looking forward to collaborating with Dr. Tyler-Garner on workforce development issues that will pave the way for Nevada to be a leader in the industries of the future.

I’m willing to work with the President and my GOP colleagues to move our country forward. Let’s start by agreeing to keep children with their parents, ending the self-inflicted shutdowns, and focusing on growing our economy by passing an infrastructure bill. #SOTU
I'd say they've earned it. #SOTU
It’s difficult to believe the President is committed to unity when he refuses to unite hundreds of children separated from their families.

Last week, I worked with Nevada’s congressional delegation to demand answers about @Energy's decision to secretly ship weapons-grade plutonium to my district. I’ll continue working to get answers on behalf of #NV04 families. 
Today, I joined 160 of my colleagues in urging the DOD not to implement @realdonaldtrump’s ban on transgender servicemembers. I’m grateful for the sacrifices these patriots have made for our nation. I’ll keep working to get them the respect, gratitude, protections they deserve.

I met with Nevada-based IRS employees on Saturday to discuss how we could help them recover from the shutdown. Late fees and interest piled up on the 3,520 Nevadans denied a paycheck during the shutdown. I'm pushing Congress to make them whole.
And I’ll work like hell to get them every penny they’re entitled to.
This shutdown has already inflicted so much harm on working people. Now, it’s about to wreak havoc on travel which impacts everything from tourism, to business to personal travel.  This is unacceptable and must end.
Tell that to the 3520 NV federal workers who won’t get a check tomorrow because of this stupid shutdown. I’m appalled at the lack of compassion by Trump and Ross who claim people can just take a loan or that grocery stores will just issue credit. What fantasy are they living in?
Not all heroes wear capes.  #TeamHorsford is at today’s @LasVegasFD graduation. Grateful for all the @LVFirefighters do to protect our city. Special shout out to @DSanfordnv on his graduation from the Fire Academy.
I’ve voted 11 times to #EndTheShutdown and stop it from hurting Nevadans that rely on housing and nutritional assistance. It’s time for Mitch McConnell to reopen the government and stop hurting Nevada families.
Shame on @SecretaryRoss. The Administration should be focused on reopening the government, not second-guessing Nevada’s 3,520 federal workers being forced to work without a paycheck.
Mitch McConnell needs to end this shutdown before it inflicts even more pain on working Nevada families.

It’s time to #EndThisShutdown before it takes food off of 430,000 Nevadans’ tables. Mitch McConnell needs to allow a vote on the House’s bipartisan legislation to fully fund the Department of Agriculture and the SNAP program.
Deeply troubled by the impact this shutdown is having on our tribes. I voted to reopen the government on the first day of the new Congress. And I’ll keep fighting to make sure Nevada’s tribes get every penny they’re owed.
