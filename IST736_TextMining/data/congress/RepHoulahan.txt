Thank you @RepSarbanes for your support! It is important that every eligible voter, no matter their work hours, have access to the ballot box.
Currently, my constituents in PA have no access to early voting. This bill and my amendment will help increase access to early voting. Increasing such access will help shift workers, people who hold multiple jobs, and others to ensure they have access to the ballot box.
I was sent to Congress to fix the broken culture in Washington. #HR1 will help address the culture of corruption in Congress
About to go on @cspan to talk about my amendment to #HR1 that would expand early voting. Every eligible voter should be able to cast a vote! Tune in to watch here
