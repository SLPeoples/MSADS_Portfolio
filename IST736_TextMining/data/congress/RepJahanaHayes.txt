By significantly restricting the use of restraints, eliminating the use of seclusion practices, and empowering teachers and faculty with proactive, evidence-based, classroom management methods we can assure that every student learns and grows in a safe and healthy school.
Every dollar siphoned away from public education threatens a student’s ability to learn.
