We did it! I joined 233 of my colleagues today to pass sweeping reforms for the government in the For the People Act. --    Protect your right to vote    Get dark money out of politics    Hold politicians accountable
Today’s the day! We’re voting on the biggest reforms since Watergate. Let’s kick big money out of politics and get our government working for the people again! #HR1
Great to join @Tiffany_Muller (from @StopBigMoney) and @RepTjCox as we get ready to vote on #HR1 the biggest reforms in decades to get dark money out of politics.
It’s not a question – let’s pass #HR1, end dark money, and make our democracy truly #ForThePeople! (6/6)
On top of all that, #ForThePeople will ensure greater access to the ballot box, prohibit voter roll purges, and end partisan gerrymandering. (5/6)
And it does so much more: It will bolster ethics laws -- closing loopholes on lobbyists and stopping members of Congress from settling sexual harassment or discrimination cases with taxpayer money. (4/6)
#HR1 helps closes that loophole and provides more transparency and accountability in our elections. (3/6)
Right now, mega-donors are allowed to give MILLIONS of dollars to secret dark money groups designed to sway our elections and never have to disclose their identity. That needs to change. (2/6)
Since the beginning, I have vowed to get dark money out of politics to make sure our government is for the people, by the people, and of the people... (1/6)
Guess what? It’s this girl’s 6th birthday! Happy birthday, Josephine! You make your Mom and I proud everyday.

Congress wasn’t willing to fund the President’s ineffective and wasteful border wall, so instead, he declared a national emergency. There is no ‘national emergency’ at our border. This President knows it and our democracy will not tolerate it.
These are some of the worst puns I've ever herd.
A national emergency represents a dangerous abuse of presidential power. There is no 'national emergency' at our border. This President knows it, his enablers in Congress know it, and our democracy will not tolerate it.
America is not a nation built on fear. We are a nation of immigrants and I will not stand idly by as this President continues to traffic in hate to promote his political agenda. Enough is enough.
As I vote yes on this imperfect bill to keep the federal government open, I do so with an urgent call to step up the fight for comprehensive immigration reform. This administration has repeatedly engaged in fear-mongering that directly affects the people of the 6th district.
