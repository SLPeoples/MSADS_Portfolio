Congratulations to the Oran boy’s basketball team for making it to the championship game! They’re going for their second state title in three years. Good
In short HR 1 will fund political campaigns with federal dollars, make our elections vulnerable to fraud and abuse, and infringe on Constitutional rights. I’ll be voting NO on the #ForThePoliticiansAct
At least they criminalized fraudulent voter registrations?
Someone at the wrong voting precinct? Who cares! I’m sure that won’t sway any local elections...
Here we have automatically registering people to vote based on DMV databases, which often have people ineligible to vote. This went so well in California (23,000 improperly registered) that @HouseDemocrats want to force it on every state!
Next up - giving convicted felons the right to vote, including people convicted of election fraud. Makes sense...
Federal dollars won’t just go towards attack ads, yard signs, and robocalls. HR 1 lets candidates use campaign funds on personal expenses such as buying health insurance. #ForThePoliticiansAct
Except because these vouchers are also eligible for a 6:1 match it’s really a $150 voucher.
But wait! Matching donations isn’t enough, so we have to give every American $25 vouchers to donate to campaigns.
Who doesn’t want more campaign ads? Paid for with tax dollars?HR 1 would match donations 600% with federal funds, allowing almost $5 million per candidate.
Alright folks buckle up we're going to comb through all 622 pages to show you��How disastrous and unconstitutional the @HouseDemocrats "For the People" Act is ��
If H.R. 1 really is for the American people, then why did @SpeakerPelosi block my amendment to make sure every person registered to vote is an American citizen?

This is everything that’s wrong in Washington.Letting the American people keep more of their hard-earned money is “theft” and “Armageddon,” but racking up tens of trillions of dollars in spending for pie-in-the-sky proposals is ok. NEWS FLASH: it’s NOT the government’s money!

Saw these Missouri cows this morning. I didn’t have the heart to tell them their gases are the cause of climate change, at least that’s what the radicals in Washington with their Green New Deal think!
#OTD in history the Star Spangled Banner officially became our national anthem. In Missouri we’re proud to stand for our flag and give our respect to everyone who fought to protect it.
Great to see so many cotton farmers from southern MIssouri yesterday and see some of the latest technology they’re using to clothe the world.
I proudly signed a partnership between the Farmington Regional Chamber of Commerce and the @SBAgov - the first of its kind in Missouri - to help local businesses thrive. Small businesses create 7 out of 10 new jobs and this partnership will help bring more jobs to our area.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is working and Americans are keeping more of what’s theirs. I shared a few stories of Missourians whose lives have changed for the better after receiving raises, bonuses, and a smaller tax bill. Watch below ️
Monday I walked across the Capitol and urged Senators to support the #BornAliveAct and protect the #RightToLifeToday in the House I requested a recorded vote and for the TENTH time @HouseDemocrats blocked a vote to give the most vulnerable children life-saving medical care.
Today House Democrats passed a gun control bill that infringes on the Constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. #HR8 will do nothing to stop mass shootings or gun violence but instead targets responsible gun owners. I voted NO
Today the Supreme Court is hearing whether the Peace Cross Memorial for WWI veterans should be torn down or not. I wrote to the Court in July urging them to protect the memorial and the legacy of the men who died serving our country.

It’s shameful that Senate Democrats just blocked a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Why in the world would anyone want to deny medical care to an infant brought into this world?
I hope you can join me tomorrow on my telephone town hall! I’ll give an update on my work in Missouri and D.C. and I’ll be taking your questions live on the phone. Details below ️

Coming up! I’m joining Faune Riggin on @960KZIM in Cape Girardeau to discuss the President’s stellar speech last night. Listen in here! #SOTU
The State of our Union is STRONG. Unemployment is low, wages are growing and Americans are keeping more of what is theirs. But more work lies ahead. We must lower health care costs, help American workers and farmers and support our President to solve the crisis at our border.
Every life is a blessing with dignity and purpose. We have to protect innocent life #SOTU

The economy is BOOMING under President Trump’s leadership and I’m honored that I was able to write the historic tax cuts that along with regulatory relief helped make it possible. #SOTU
I couldn’t agree more with the President - repealing the death tax is one of the best things we can do for family farmers. That’s why I’ve authored the bill to end the death tax once and for all. #SOTU

Today I shared the story of MaryAnn and Greg from Missouri who have a pre-existing condition and have struggled to find options with Obamacare. We need more competition and options,not a complete government takeover that forces people to buy plans they can’t afford. Watch above️
The left tries to say that Republicans don't support protecting pre-existing conditions because we disagree with Obamacare and plans for a government takeover of the healthcare system. In reality it can't provide adequate coverage to those who need it.
Be safe this week - some places in Missouri may see a wind chill as low as -40 degrees! When it's this cold, frostbite can set in within 10 minutes. Make sure you have everything you need to stay warm and safe during the bitter

The Speaker claimed she wouldn’t negotiate securing the border until the government was reopened, and now she has her shot. 3/5
In response, Speaker Pelosi refused to allow her Caucus to meet with the President, offered no more than $1 to secure our borders, and even went as far as canceling the State of the Union. 2/5
Over the last 35 days of this partial government shutdown, President Trump has been more than reasonable, making offer after offer in good faith to Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader Schumer to reach a long term deal to secure the border and reopen the government. 1/5

For 100 years, @TheSalemNews has kept my hometown and Dent County informed. It was a pleasure to celebrate their centennial in the U.S. House of Representatives and share my remarks in the Congressional Record with the newspaper staff.
On December 1st they capped off their perfect 15-0 season where they outscored their opponents 838-80. Having 8 all-state players is a testament to the team's hard work and preparation, and we are all incredibly proud of them!
I had a blast helping Hayti High School celebrate their football team's historic state championship!

It was great seeing so many people from Missouri come all the way out to our nation’s Capital to advocate for the right to life. Working together we can change minds and open hearts to choose life.

She says building a wall is "immoral," but that's not what Democrat Leaders were saying just a few years ago. What's really immoral is letting drugs, convicted criminals, gang members, and even terrorists expose our weak borders without taking action.
The border security debate has been marked with insanity for years, but especially now with Speaker Pelosi in charge of the U.S. House of Representatives.

For more than 40 years it's been illegal for federal tax dollars to be used to fund abortion services, but a loophole remains where abortion clinics can be subsidized with YOUR tax dollars.
This is absurd. Nancy Pelosi can't come to the table on national security but she can fund abortions overseas with OUR tax dollars.

Merry Christmas to you and your family! May the joys of life, family, and God’s blessings fill your heart on this wonderful day.
Every day that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer put partisan politics above national security I will be giving up pay. It’s ridiculous that politicians can fund themselves but not fund border security.
