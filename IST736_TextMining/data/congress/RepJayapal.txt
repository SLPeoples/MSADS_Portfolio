Working with my friend @RepLloydDoggett, I was able to successfully include a provision into HR1 that requires release of both personal AND business tax returns for any president. That's what we need and it's what we must demand immediately from Trump.
5. Our plan takes this on. In @ddayen's words: "But if we’re really going to talk about cost, we should acknowledge that the Jayapal bill is demonstrably more serious about the issue than any comprehensive bill on the right or the center-left, inclu Obamacare..."
4. American families businesses are already paying unsustainable costs of current system--thru deductibles, premiums, co-pays terrible health outcomes--because we have refused to rein in costs of care from a system that puts no limits on the industries that profit.
3. That we currently spend (GASP) $32 trillion, a # only increasing dramatically over next decade. What they want you to think is that this $32 trillion is NEW spending, which would then mean NEW taxes. It's a fallacy--but their last hope of defeating a push for real change.
2. He points our clearly that the discussions about cost invariably revolve around industry front talking points that point to estimates of $32 trillion (GASP!) to cover everyone with comprehensive care no out-of-pocket costs. What they don't want you to know?

Wow. 23 House Republicans voted yesterday AGAINST a resolution condemning anti-semitism, Islamaphobia, white supremacy and bigotry of all kinds. Just so America knows exactly where they stand who is truly against hate not just as a political ploy.

That's right: thanks to our @USProgressives letter and the work of @RepLloydDoggett, H.R. 1 will require Trump to disclose his tax returns. ALL politicians, even the ones in the Oval Office, should have to disclose any financial conflicts of interest.
