#HR1 imposes dangerous limits on free speech, provides government subsidies for campaigns, implements unconstitutional mandates, weaponizes the FEC. It is a blatant encroachment on liberty, but sadly it falls in line with the new socialist agenda of the Democrat majority.
Do not be fooled by the title of #HR1. The “For the People Act” would be more appropriately named “For the Democrats Act.” It’s a wolf in sheep’s clothing an attempted power grab by House Democrats to centralize power in one place – Washington – and far away from the people.

I am a cosponsor of @RepLeeZeldin's resolution to reject and condemn anti-Semitic hate in the U.S. and around the world, and @SpeakerPelosi should bring it up for a vote immediately!
Anti-Semitism coming from some on the left in Congress is dangerous–there is no place for it in our society. This is far from an isolated incident w/ Rep. Omar’s anti-Semitism, she should not have the honor of serving on Foreign Affairs Committee w/ these disgraceful views.
Democrats now want to slash # of ICE detention beds, meaning officials would have to release illegal immigrants, even ones w/ criminal records, back into US interior. Dems are standing in the way making it harder for our brave law enforcement to do their jobs enforce the laws

I filed the Eliminating Foreign Intervention in Elections Act to cut federal funding from any state/municipality that allows noncitizens or illegal immigrants to vote. More more of these initiatives are popping up across the country, so we must keep working to push this bill.
These dangerous egregious policies are allowing the voice of the American citizen to be watered down at the voting booth, I believe we must fight to protect the integrity of our elections the value of American citizenship.
Too many liberal communities are beginning to allow noncitizens illegal immigrants the sacred right to vote in local elections as part of their open borders agenda. Today, it’s local elections – next, it could be state or nationwide elections.
Even though the House is now led by Nancy Pelosi open border Democrats, I will never stop fighting to make our country safe for all Americans. This starts by ensuring federal dollars are restricted from jurisdictions that have no respect for our nation’s laws.
Sanctuary cities foster encourage illegal activity which poses a great danger to American citizens. Congress must do all it can to defund crack down on these jurisdictions that encourage illegal behavior, my bill will do just that.
Along w/ securing our porous southern border building the wall, we must continue to work to defund dangerous sanctuary cities, which is why I have introduced the Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Act.
