The failed war on drugs has devastated communities of color. So-called law and order policies have unnecessarily wrecked millions of lives. But a degenerate criminal like Paul Manafort gets a judicial slap on the wrist? OUTRAGEOUS.
The system is rigged.It benefits the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected.It’s time to #CleanUpCorruption and end the era of voter suppression.And that’s why the House just passed HR-1
House Dems wake up fighting for working families, the middle class, senior citizens.We stand with the poor, the sick and the afflicted.The other side doesn’t like that, and seeks to divide us. We. Will. Not. Be. Broken.
Hey Mitch, you have NEVER spoken up about the tidal wave of hatred from the so-called President.Don’t ever lecture @HouseDemocrats about intolerance.  We will handle our business.And you can PIPE DOWN.
No indictments/convictions/corruption scandals during 8-year Obama presidency.Yet phonies were outraged . . . wait for it . . . because @BarackObama once wore a tan suit. Meanwhile, they are silent on crime spree associated w/ Individual 1.Who are these people?
Drug prices are out of control.No one should be forced to choose between food, shelter life-saving medication.We must break grip of special interest power to get this done.So this week HR-1 will strike a blow against �������� ������ #ForThePeople.
This attack is dangerous and disgusting. Islamophobia is on the rise. And the Republican outrage machine is nowhere to be found. SHAMELESS.
Conservatives lost it when one member in a body of 435 used a profane word.So-called leader of the free world calls Russia investigation  “bullsh*t” before the nation.Were these phonies outraged?Of course not.Don’t ever lecture House Dems about anything.
House Dems fighting to lower healthcare costs and increase pay #ForThePeople.House Republicans too busy defending the wealthy, well-off and well-connected to help out.Let me also be clear.Individual 1 can run, but he cannot hide.

Just blasted so and so for unconstitutional medieval � border wall declaration.  It’s a phony, fraudulent and fake national emergency.Not. In. Our. House.
Illegal border crossings are way down.No evidence supports claim of increased criminal activity at the border.There is no national crisis.This guy (Individual 1) peddles more stories than Harry Potter re: the border.And they are all make believe.
While Trump is in Asia playing footsie with a brutal dictator, House Dems are hard at work.This week, we will introduce voting rights legislation, oppose the fake emergency on the House floor and pass a universal criminal background check bill.It’s on.#ForThePeople

No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by LAW.Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 (U.S. CONSTITUTION).The so-called President’s national emergency declaration is fake, phony and fraudulent.And it’s blatantly unconstitutional.
Trump’s phony voter fraud commission has been disbanded.But it turns out they should have focused on the North Carolina degenerates who stole a congressional seat from House Dems.The response from Individual 1?Crickets.

Why did Trump declare a fake national emergency?Mexico shut him down.Republicans failed to fund his medieval border wall during two years of complete control.And new House Democratic majority told him to take a hike.All. He. Does. Is. Lose.
Trump just declared a phony national emergency.Apprehensions have not increased on the Southern border. They have decreased.America should really be concerned about the invasion that helped place you at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
