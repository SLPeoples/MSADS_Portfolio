This #InternationalWomensDay let us celebrate the contributions of women across the globe, and recommit ourselves to the pursuit of equality for all.
I am incredibly proud that the #ForThePeople Act passed in the House today, taking us one step further on our journey of leveling the playing field to give Americans the voice that they deserve in how our country is governed, and ending the #CultureOfCorruption in Washington.

The Trump Admin's decision to dismantle #DACA #TPS protections has thrown thousands of families into turmoil, fear, and uncertainty. We must provide the permanent protections these individuals need and deserve. Watch my statement from today's @HouseJudiciary hearing here:
The American people have had enough of the #CultureOfCorruption in Washington. I'm proud to support the #ForThePeople Act, a historic reform package that will reduce the role of money in politics, strengthen voting rights, and restore the promise of our nation’s democracy.
TY @NYCFirstLady for announcing 4 new monuments in NYC honoring trailblazing women.  For too long, we have not done enough to honor the significant contributions of women in our city and nation.  #SheBuiltNYC #WomensHistoryMonth 
This morning, @HouseJudiciary holds its first hearing on protecting #Dreamers and TPS recipients. The Trump Administration’s decision to dismantle current protections have placed hundreds of thousands of families into turmoil and uncertainty - something we must address.

President Trump’s attempt to strip Congress of its constitutional duty in order to fulfill a campaign promise is a gross abuse of power. Proud to support this important resolution nullifying this fake national emergency declaration.
The promotion and inclusion of an avowedly racist party is a betrayal of Israeli democracy and of Israel's friends and supporters around the world. Otzma Yehudit's anti-Arab, racist philosophy should have no place in the Knesset. Their legitimization is simply unacceptable.

Pleased to see @NYDailyNews standing with @nytimes against @realDonaldTrump's heinous claim that the media is the enemy of the people.
Very concerning @NYTimes report about the President’s conduct. One of the many reasons why Matthew Whitaker must come back to @HouseJudiciary to clarify his testimony.
ICYMI in the FY19 Appropriations Bill Congress passed last week that averted another #TrumpShutdown there was $650 million for Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor and a significant portion will go to the very important urgent Gateway Tunnel Project.  
Thanks Brad.  It was great to join you @MoveOn and so many New Yorkers in Union Square today protesting @realDonaldTrump #FakeEmergency.  As I said the real emergency is that he might get away with it.
President Trump’s attempt to strip Congress of its duty by declaring a national emergency subverts key principles laid out in our Constitution. @HouseJudiciary is demanding answers:
Monitoring the awful shooting in Aurora, Il. where five people have died and four police officers are among the injured. We must do more to prevent gun violence.
It is imperative that the Gateway Tunnel Project - the most important transportation infrastructure project in the country - is kept on track, and I am pleased it received vital funding from Congress. Read my full statement here:
We cannot allow the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund - which thousands of responders and survivors depend upon - to be gutted. Read my full statement with @RepMaloney and @RepPeteKing on our efforts to make the VCF program permanent:
The President's decision to declare a national emergency is a gross abuse of power that cannot be tolerated. Congress will hold the Administration accountable for this reckless disregard of the rule of law.
Organ donors save lives but hurdles stop many from becoming living donors. I intro'd the Living Donor Protection Act w/ @HerreraBeutler, @SenGillibrand, @SenTomCotton to give donors time to recover from surgery protect them from high insurance rates.

We must call out anti-Semitism and other forms of hate no matter where they come from on the political spectrum.  As a corollary, those peddling such hatreds themselves have no standing whatsoever to do so, for that is nothing less than pure, ugly hypocrisy. Watch this video.

Here’s an update on the situation at the MDC. Thanks to @BilldeBlasio and @nycoem blankets and hand warmers and generators are on the way to prison.  Just because you’re  incarcerated does not mean that we don’t treat you with dignity respect.  Heat hot water is not a luxury

Acting AG Whitaker must appear before @HouseJudiciary. Despite claims otherwise, @TheJusticeDept Office of Legal Counsel has twice determined that DOJ officials must provide testimony at hearings, even during a funding lapse. Read my letter requiring his testimony by Jan. 29th:
We will hold the Administration accountable for these actions, and as Chairman of @HouseJudiciary, I intend to use all means necessary to get to the bottom of this injustice.
Prior to the new Congress, @HouseJudiciary put officials on notice that we will investigate the family separation policy and the longstanding damage it has had on families.
At the end of the 115th Congress, @JudiciaryGOP scheduled its only oversight hearing with @DHSgov. Again, @SecNielsen denied the existence of a family separation policy, making it clear that DHS was either incompetent, or grossly negligent, in the implementation of this policy.
After the visit, I introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, which prohibits the cruel policy of separating children from their parents. Over 190 @HouseDemocrats supported the bill. Unsurprisingly, @HouseGOP refused to bring it up for a vote.
When the "zero tolerance" policy was enacted, I made an unannounced visit on Father’s Day to the Elizabeth Detention Facility in NJ where I spoke with fathers who had been separated from their children. Many did not know when—if ever—they would be reunited with their kids.
Over the last week, I have received over 5,000 letters from people all across the country expressing their opposition to @realDonaldTrump's cruel, un-American family separation policy.

Americans overwhelmingly support universal background checks which will make us safer from gun violence. The current law is riddled with loopholes, making it too easy for dangerous people to get guns. I proudly support #HR8 which expands these life-saving checks to all gun sales.

This weekend, I will be joining my colleagues @RepTorresSmall and @JoaquinCastrotx of the @HispanicCaucus in Alamogordo, NM to investigate the death of Felipe Gómez Alonzo, the 8-year-old Guatemalan child who died on Christmas Eve in @DHSgov custody.
Joined @NewDay to discuss the importance of following all the facts on behalf of the American people. The Special Counsel has a job to do, and we must protect the Mueller investigation from being undermined while also doing our own investigative work as well on @HouseJudiciary.
