I was a judge at #SXSW2019’s #DellPolicyHack where I listened to teams present their policy solutions to modern tech problems like cyber security.Great work from all the teams! All the pitches give me a lot to think about when I go back to #DC.
I’d like to thank @ACLU for a thoughtful conversation on #EmergingTech #CivilLiberty protections at #SXSW2019.I’m going to continue pursuing an open dialogue w/ @Amazon about their facial recognition software my concerns about it being used by law enforcement officials.
Good morning from #SXSW!At @EUintheUS’s breakfast, I reiterated the importance of protecting consumer data — ESPECIALLY when it comes to @Amazon Rekognition. With new data tech rapidly emerging, we need to find new ways to both protect consumers encourage innovation.
Off to @sxsw for an @ACLU panel on @amazon’s facial recognition software.We’re tackling: What’s at stake for #PeopleOfColor Striking a balance between regulation innovation How Congress can pursue oversight accountabilityMore info HERE:
Today and every day we celebrate the strong women who fought — and continue to fight — for gender equality. Empowered women continue to move the world in a positive direction through their determination and perseverance. #IWD2019

This ruling is another vital step in blocking @realDonaldTrump from adding an untested citizenship question to the #2020Census. Through the courts @HouseDemocrats majority, we’re committed to pushing back on this administration’s attempt to suppress our immigrant communities.
Let the 2nd anniversary of Trump’s #TravelBan 2.0 serve as a reminder that it’s up to ALL of us to uphold America’s foundational promise — that regardless of who you are, where you come from, or how you worship, if you seek a better life, there is a place for you in this nation.

If we are to stay free, we need to protect the freedoms of others. We need to protect:• Women’s rights• LGBTQ+ rights• Immigrants' rightsThis shouldn't be controversial. This is basic common decency. #SOTU
If @realDonaldTrump was serious about #NationalSecurity, the 1st thing he'd do is LISTEN to his national security advisers.But #POTUS has shown that he'd rather listen to Vladmir Putin than the heads of the @FBI @CIA @ODNIgov.That's something that should concern us all. #SOTU
Women of color are most harmed by this administration’s anti-abortion, anti-woman policies. From clinic closures to abortion coverage bans, women of color are forced to scramble to get the care they need. This is unacceptable. #ProtectAbortionAccess #SOTU
Nobody has done more to undermine protections for patients with #PreExistingConditions than @realDonaldTrump and Congressional Republicans.Don't you dare try to gaslight us about that, #POTUS#SOTU
I’m proud to call these 106 women my colleagues. They are fearless. They are brave. They represent what happens when EVERYONE is involved in the Democratic process. #SOTU
How is @realDonaldTrump going to stand there and rail against undocumented immigrants when his OWN businesses exploited them as workers?By the way, my #SOTU guest — Sandra Diaz — was one of those workers. Thank you for joining us tonight, Sandra! I’m inspired by your courage.
Our “moral duty to create an immigration system that protects” lives DOES NOT include putting children in cages, separating families at the border, and building a wall symbolic of hate. #SOTU
Despite what you heard in the #SOTU, there is no “national crisis.” Undocumented immigration has been decreasing for YEARS and attempted border crossings are at 40-year LOWS. The only “national crisis” was manufactured by this administration.
No investigations?! Our job as Members of Congress is to hold @realDonaldTrump and his administration accountable. It's called Oversight. And you can count on @HouseDemocrats to do just that. #SOTU
FACT: The VAST majority of @RealDonaldTrump's $1.5 TRILLION #TaxScam went to millionaires, billionaires, and powerful corporations.Under the Trump administration, #WorkingFamilies are getting poorer and the rich are just getting richer. #SOTU
Some examples of how @realDonaldTrump crippled #WorkingFamilies: • Attacking the #ACA and people with pre-existing conditions. • Forcing 800k federal workers to work without two paychecks. • Pushing #GOPTaxScam that only helps the rich.This is NOT #ForThePeople. #SOTU
If wages are rising, why can’t we #RaisetheWage to $15/hour? No one should have to work multiple full-time jobs just to make ends meet. #SOTU
306 days have passed since the start of the #FamilySeparationCrisis.Thousands of kids remain separated from their parents -- some of whom have been lost in the system. This is choosing anything BUT “greatness.” #SOTU
#IncomeInequality, #ClimateChange, skyrocketing health care costs, aging infrastructure, and a broken immigration system — these are some of the biggest issues facing America.Will Trump propose real solutions or just feed more red meat to his base? We'll find out soon.#SOTU
Tonight, I'm joining my male @HouseDemocrats colleagues in wearing a white ribbon, standing in solidarity with the female suffragettes who refused to take no for an answer.
Trayvon Martin would have turned 24 today.His birthday is a reminder to us that far too many black lives are unjustifiably cut short in America.We can — and we MUST — do better to hold power to account ensure no one is denied justice or due process. #RestInPower, Trayvon.
2) Sandra’s story isn’t just my family’s story, but also the story of many of my constituents in #CA34, California across the US.It’s a story that needs to be heard.I’m going to continue doing everything in my power to make sure @realDonaldTrump hears it today everyday.
1) Why did I invite Sandra Diaz as my #SOTU guest?Her story — one of an undocumented immigrant who worked in the laundry room of Trump’s Bedminster golf club — reminds me of my mom. She too was an immigrant who worked the laundry room of a convalescent home to support us.
This was @realDonaldTrump’s plan to “fix” the border crisis: Separate families Keep children in warehouses Deport parents Deny medical care compassionThey’re not helping secure our borders, they’re creating a humanitarian crisis at the border. #OurHispanicSOTU
Happy #LunarNewYear to everyone celebrating in #LA and across the world!May you and your loved ones have a healthy and prosperous Year of the Pig.

4,500 incidents in a little over a month is inexcusable.When will #GOP leaders stop listening to the @NRA start listening to the voices of their constituents?As a @HouseGVP member, I’m working to #EndGunViolence ensure #NeverAgain isn’t just a rallying cry, but a reality.
“I knew someone had to take the first step and I made up my mind not to move.”  Happy 106th birthday Rosa Parks!#BlackHistoryMonth
Happy #MuralMonday!“Puro Cypress” by Margaret Garcia stretches for most of the 2700 block of Pepper Ave. in #CypressPark and features vignettes of everyday life in the neighborhood. Check it out!Share your favorite #CA34 mural with us at CA34.communications@mail.house.gov
Seeing your loved ones battle cancer is never easy – I saw my father lose his battle to pancreatic cancer.On #WorldCancerDay, we remember the loved ones we’ve lost, the ones who are fighting, and the families staying strong. Our fight for a cure isn’t over!
Sigh...It might not have been the result we wanted, but the @RamsNFL have a lot to be proud of. Already counting the days until kickoff next season. #Superbowl53
#LA has been waiting too long for this moment. It's time to bring it home @RamsNFL!
#OTD the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified, allowing black men the right to vote. Voting is an integral part of any democracy I am committed to protecting those rights for EVERYONE – including supporting #AVR same-day registration in #HR1 so everyone’s voice is heard.
#RIP to Dr. Michelle King, the first African American woman to serve as @LASchools Superintendent. An advocate for our community, Dr. King fought for better educational opportunities for #LA students and families. She will be missed.

#BlackHistoryMonth is a time for all Americans to reflect and appreciate the African American community's contributions to our nation, our culture, and our shared identity. Read my statement:
Sandra Diaz — one of Trump’s former housekeepers — will be my #SOTU guest.When I first met Sandra, I was inspired by her story courage. It’s no small feat for a migrant from Costa Rica to stand up to a bully hypocrite in the @WhiteHouse.Read more:

2) I want to extend my deepest thanks to the individuals groups who came to my #ImmigrationRoundtable today.United, our voices send a clear message to @WhiteHouse that #LA will continue to recognize the dignity of immigrants live up to the principles that define our nation.
