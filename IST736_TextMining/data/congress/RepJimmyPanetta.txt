The House just passed HR 1112, closing the Charleston Loophole. It is humbling to be a part of a Congress that, after over two decades, finally passed two major pieces of legislation (#HR8, #HR1112) to strengthen background checks that can lead to the reduction of gun violence.
Today, I will vote for #HR1112 to close the Charleston loophole. This bill will allow the FBI more time to run background checks so we can stop prohibited gun owners from slipping through the cracks.

We just passed #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. This is the first major action on gun violence by the House in more than two decades, and an important step toward the necessary reduction of gun violence across our nation. 
Today, I will vote for #HR8 the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. The purpose of the bill is straightforward - to ensure that individuals already prohibited from gun possession under federal law are not able to obtain firearms.  It closes the background check loophole.

The President can open up the government with a stroke of a pen.  Instead, he has chosen to use this government shutdown as a tool to fulfill a campaign promise.

The House just passed a resolution to intervene in the Texas v. U.S. ruling.  We are living up to our promises to protect the Affordable Care Act and ensure coverage for pre-exiting conditions.
The President’s refusal to help Americans recovering from deadly and destructive wildfires is not just irresponsible, it is vindictive. Just stop it already, and start working with us to get serious about preventing wildfires and helping our communities.
That is why we cannot prolong this shut down and we must open up the government immediately, get paychecks in people’s pockets, get over our party politics, and get serious about comprehensive immigration reform.
Any discussion about border security must be coupled with immigration reform that takes into account the option for our Dreamers, farmworkers, and recipients of TPS to earn their citizenship. However, such serious discussions take time, especially if done in a bipartisan manner
I strongly believe in bolstering the security on our borders, not with solutions from the 4th century, but with technology and infrastructure from the 21st century.
This week, Congress will vote on and pass legislation that will reopen Treasury and IRS, USDA, EPA and DOI.
Last week, Congress passed two bills to reopen government services, ensure workers get the paychecks they have earned, and restore certainty to the lives of the American people.  The bills also included provisions to provide back pay to federal employees.
Despite the President proudly prolonging the partial government shut down, the House of Representatives has passed legislation to reopen our government.
The ripple effect from this shut down will be felt far and beyond the people who rely on the federal government for employment and benefits, but also will be felt by every day Americans as some basic government services are stopped.
Nearly 800,000 federal workers, including 39,000 in California, have been furloughed and may soon not get paychecks.  Money for food stamps and federal housing may soon dry up.
.@realDonaldTrump’s decision to single handedly shut down a significant part of our government in order to fulfill a campaign promise by building an expensive and ineffective wall at our southern border is irresponsible, unprincipled, and is actually hurting Americans.
Tonight, President Donald Trump again made it clear how proud he is to put his petulance and politics over legitimate policy and the lives of the American people.

@photographNic @mcweekly Thank you for highlighting my staff’s work on behalf of the people of the Central Coast. Happy New Year, Nic.
As stated by @RepRaulGrijalva, the recent chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the incoming Chairman of @NRDems, the Select Committee on Climate Change is a "platform to really talk about climate change and really enter it back into the dialogue for this country.”
At the same time, we will continue to be that necessary check on the Trump Administration as they take the opposite approach.
Thank you, @NancyPelosi, for living up to your commitment to revive the Select Committee on Climate Change. Look forward to working together -with all Dems- to find a sustainable, economically feasible way forward as we continue to combat the affects of man-made climate change.

It is imperative that the President stop threatening the stability and prosperity of our country over an ill-conceived campaign promise and that Congress come together to responsibly identify a long-term budget solution to fund our government.
Despite the President's rejection of those proposals and his call for this shutdown, Democrats will continue to work with Republicans to come to an agreement to reopen our government.
Decisively, Congressional Democrats offered multiple proposals to keep the government open, including one that passed the Senate unanimously, and all of which included funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, not an ineffective and expensive wall.
Disappointingly, the federal government has partially shut down as of this morning.  Disturbingly, President Donald Trump called for this shutdown more than 25 times and now has gotten what he wanted.
Complete withdrawal from Syria. Major drawdown in Afghanistan. Is Korea next? President Trump, what is the strategy? Conducting national security policy without consultation, agreement, buy in, or intent is a danger and damaging to our values.
Mattis understands international security,stability require principled American leadership.This voice was rare in this chaotic Administration.I hope the next SecDef appreciates the strategic value American partnerships contribute to the world,as Mattis does
