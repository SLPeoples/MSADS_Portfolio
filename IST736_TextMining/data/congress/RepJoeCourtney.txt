Over the next 5 yrs, #RaiseTheWage would incrementally raise the federal minimum to $15. The steady increase is good for workers and families, good for business, and good for the economy. No American working a 40-hour week should live in poverty.
Today, @EdLaborCmte passed the #RaiseTheWage Act out of committee. It has been 10 years since the federal minimum wage saw an increase, and it fails to reflect the true cost of living in every state.

A uniform test method and rating system for homes with potential #crumblingfoundations will be a crucially important step for understanding the scope of the problem, and will help to provide clarity to homeowners and home-buyers. @UConnEngineer is working to make that happen.
The research underway at the department is aimed at determining the most accurate methods for testing pyrrhotite levels in concrete samples, and their findings could provide a more comprehensive understanding of a foundation’s potential for failure.

@Momsdemand’s advocacy is a painful, but important reminder that gun violence remains a national epidemic, and that we can no longer settle for thoughts prayers. House passage of 2 bills this week to expand #BackgroundChecks are a good first step. #HonorWithAction #HR8 #HR1112
I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from @MomsDemand Action of Southeastern CT today in my Norwich District office. This non-partisan, grassroots movement strives to educate communities on gun safety and #gunviolence prevention.

A big thank you to all of the outstanding farms that took part in the event, as well as to the local community members who turned out to learn more about this important part of eastern Connecticut’s economy.
The yearly event is an opportunity for members of the community – restaurateurs, shop owners, students, and others – to learn about the local agricultural sector and build working relationships with eastern #Connecticut farmers.
I had a great saturday morning stopping by the fourth annual ‘Know Your Farmer Fair’ organized by the Windham Community Food Network in Willimantic.
A strong outlook for our defense sector, along with positive economic indicators on the national level, provides reason to be optimistic about employment growth in 2019 and beyond.
I was pleased to join the @MdsxChamber yesterday morning to discuss jobs and our regional economy.
Congrats to Customs and Border Patrol for once again showing ports of entry are where we need to boost security to stop killer drugs, which Congress just voted to do!
The medals serve as a demonstration of the years of service and sacrifice of Mr. Howard and his family. Honoring our veterans and providing them with the care and recognition they have earned will remain at the forefront of my work, both in Washington and at home in eastern CT.
15 different medals -- including the Bronze Star, Silver Star and #PurpleHeart – were presented to the family to honor the exemplary service of the Mr. Flavell who served his country bravely in World War II and the Korean War, where he was tragically killed in action.

We are just one week away from this year’s @AccessHealthCT #openenrollment deadline! It’s imperative that eastern CT residents find the best coverage possible for themselves, their families or small businesses. For more info, check out my resource page.
The President should listen to the responsible voices from the border who live there, not talk radio
There's an urgent need to better utilize shipyards like EB to ensure existing boats new ones like Delaware are fully modernized — and as a leader on the seapower subcommittee, I'll keep pressing the Navy to do so.
The @usnavy decision to move repair work to Groton isn't just good news for @GDElectricBoat, it's good news for our submarine force. And it will sustain about 300 jobs in our region.
Excited and proud to be a cosponsor of the #ForThePeopleAct, and to start off the #116th on the right foot.
The spending bill passed out of the House today is a good faith measure based on overwhelming bipartisan support in the last Congress to fund federal agencies that provide critical services to millions of Americans every day, and it deserves a vote in the Senate. #Shutdown2018
I’m on Instagram! Follow my account for updates on my days in Washington and back home in eastern CT.
Proud to kick of the #116thCongress with these great colleagues! @rosadelauro @RepJohnLarson, @JahanaHayesCT @jahimes
I look forward to a continued partnership with Governor-elect @NedLamont as we work to pave the way for this expansion for #HempFarming in our state, ensuring our farmers have the support they need.
Industrial #HempFarming holds tremendous potential for growth within our agriculture sector, and its expansion in the recently passed #FarmBill2018 provides an exciting opportunity for our state.
I joined @GeorgeColli @WTNH to talk about what's ahead in the #116thCongress as we prepare for the peaceful transition of power, and to end the government shutdown. See our full interview here:
Less than 2 weeks to go until the January 15th deadline to sign up for healthcare through @AccessHealthCT. It’s critical that families and businesses across eastern CT #getcovered! For more information,
Every day, the casework staff in my office go to bat for eastern CT residents. In 2018, their efforts helped return $1.9 million to our constituents. I’m proud of the work we do for our district, and grateful to work with such dedicated staff.
#HappyNewYear! Wishing eastern CT families a happy, healthy and safe 2019. As always, I feel lucky to live in and represent Connecticut’s second district in Congress, and I look forward to another year of fighting hard for your values.
Farewell to Sec Mattis- thank you for reminding us that the men and women in uniform take an oath to support and defend the Constitution- not to a person, or even a homeland, but to a way of life.

RT @thehill: House lawmakers look to reassure Australia after Mattis resignation
Now more than ever it is important for Congress to assert its constitutional role in ensuring our nation’s defense – and I will continue to work in a bipartisan way to strengthen our relationship with Australia, which is vital to our security at home and around the world.
Recent events have left allies like Australia unsure of our commitment to our long standing alliances. That is why I helped lead a bipartisan letter of 21 members strongly affirming Congress’ continued commitment to the US-Australia alliance.
Wishing the families across eastern Connecticut a Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season. Hoping your days are filled with peace, joy, and loved ones.
GOP Senator Bob Corker nails it: shutdown is a farce.
The Senate failed to do its part and pass the #BlueWaterNavy Vietnam Veterans Act that passed in the House unanimously this year. Watch my full remarks on the dissapointing outcome in the Senate below.
Thank you #SecretaryMattis for your decades of diligent and principled service to our nation. While we did not always agree, I never doubted that you were a sure hand keeping our entire government focused on America's true national security interests.
I was honored to be a part of the launch of the Naval Maritime Consortium at @UConn Avery Point last month, and am proud to work with partners like @UConn and @ThamesRiverIP to accomplish this important exciting goal.
Our region is preparing for tremendous growth in submarine construction work in the coming years, and a robust supply chain will be a critical component for successful execution.
This week my office announced $62,100 in federal grant money to the Development Agency to the Naval Maritime Consortium in #Groton, providing the network with the resources for establishing a framework that supports capital investment and job creation in eastern CT.
