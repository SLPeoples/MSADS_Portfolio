But let me end with this: @DanCrenshawTX, your commitment to our country is unquestionable, and I’m grateful for it. This bill is about making sure every vote counts and everyone can cast one. Think we can all agree on that. (3/3)
Here’s the TRUTH about #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act: It’s overdue, critical legislation to fight back against corruption in Washington, establish clean, fair transparent elections, end dominance of big money in our politics guarantee the right to vote for all Americans. (2/3)
.@DanCrenshawTX’s claim is completely false. Election fraud -- like what happened in #NC09 -- is illegal today and would still remain illegal after #HR1 is signed into law. (1/3)
Insurers will continue to skirt parity laws deny patients lifesaving mental health care until we hold them accountable. We would never accept this for a cancer diagnosis, yet it’s a daily reality for those suffering with mental illness and their families. They deserve better.

Make no mistake, this is a government-orchestrated effort to silence reporters, hide the truth and subdue dissent.  This President has made clear how he feels about asylum seekers and a free press. Even so, this is outrageous.
Today and every day, we celebrate the strong, trailblazing women in our lives and throughout our history. On #InternationalWomensDay, we recommit to fighting with them for a world where everyone counts.
As GOP stands unified against a bill to strengthen our democracy increase transparency in our elections, it’s important to remember that the #NC09 seat is vacant because a GOP candidate tried to steal an election only failed because local journalists uncovered the truth. #HR1
That these stories are so common strikes at the profound injustice of our justice system. Wealth can buy leniency while poverty and race are used to criminalize.
Whether in words or actions, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, racism, sexism and hatred in any form cause deep suffering that cannot be ignored. Read my full statement on today's resolution below.
Survivors of domestic and sexual violence should never feel alone in their pursuit of justice and safety. By reauthorizing #VAWA, we can ensure those survivors know they always have somewhere to turn in their communities and a government willing to stand with them. #VAWA4ALL
This is exactly why we need to pass #HR1 and hand the power of our democracy back to voters. Mitch McConnell and his donors should not hold the sole power to decide our nation’s future. #ForThePeople

We passed #HR8 today because we’ve seen too many parents mourn lost children children mourn lost parents. We passed it because Americans took to the streets demanded action. And we will keep fighting until those streets are free of gun violence the mourning can end.
After nearly a decade of GOP ignoring massacres daily gun violence, their only contribution to #HR8 was a reminder that they can’t do anything without scapegoating immigrants. And then almost all of them still voted to leave our communities vulnerable to gun violence anyways.
We have watched bullets tear through the safest enclaves of our communities country. We have watched elected officials offer their thoughts as a shield to students gunned down in classrooms worshipers killed in churches temples. Today, we stop thinking start acting. #HR8
More than anything else, universal health care is about a government that believes no one should stand alone in their time of deepest need. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor #MedicareForAll, as we work to make good on our belief that health care is a right in this country.
There is no emergency on the border that will be solved by an expensive, ineffective wall. We can fix our immigration system, provide relief to Central American refugees live up to our proud American values, but only if GOP POTUS stop fearmongering and lying about immigrants.
The American health care system is rife with inequities that have no place in the richest, most powerful nation on earth. Today I am proud to add my name to the new #MedicareForAll bill being introduced by @RepJayapal because I believe it is a strong roadmap for our path forward.
A gag rule that injects politics into health care decisions that should be made by women their doctors will leave patients vulnerable. This rule continues the Trump Admin’s assault on women, abortion rights and our entire health care system.

There should never be another school, concert, place of worship, or community shattered by gun violence. If there is, that tragedy will lie at the feet of a government that believes innocent death is the price of freedom.
There never should have been loved ones taken by a bullet on Valentine’s Day without a goodbye. There never should have been a young man who had access to a military style assault rifle.

I’m deeply disappointed in today’s decision. In the weeks and months ahead we will continue to fight this kind of bigotry, from the halls of Congress to the chambers of our justice system and the streets of our communities.
American servicemembers unconditionally put their lives on the line to keep us safe. They all deserve the same loyalty in return. Instead, @realDonaldTrump's ban on trans troops makes a mockery of that sacrifice and of our collective commitment to keep this country safe and free.
Americans working for their country shouldn’t bear the burden of their government’s dysfunction. That’s why I called on the 3 leading credit agencies to protect furloughed workers contractors from negative credit scores.
Martin Luther King Jr. believed deeply in this country’s capacity to change. But he knew that would only happen with unrelenting activism, accountability a refusal to let injustice lie — a lesson as true today as ever. So we fight on, towards the nation he believed we could be.

America’s federal workers don’t just deserve better, they earned better.  Better than a White House that sees them as expendable. Better than a President who has no problem demanding they work for free as they default on loans, face eviction, go hungry empty savings accounts.

This country has a shameful record of denying native people their land and livelihood. The Mashpee Wampanoag people have been forced to fight this battle far too long. 
One of the countless ways this Administration has targeted women's health, constitutional rights reproductive justice. Proud to join my colleagues in calling for an immediate rejection of this rule. @NARAL @PPact

He chose to separate those families. He chose to keep kids in tent cities. He chose tear gas for asylum seekers. He chose to use the livelihood of 800,000 federal workers as collateral. But @realDonaldTrump clearly won’t choose to end a crisis he created, so the GOP Senate must.

I never had the privilege of serving with @GabbyGiffords because a gun too easily fell into the wrong hands 8 years ago. But today, because of her so many others, Congress replaces silence with action. #HR8 will save lives when it’s signed into law. #UpdateBackgroundChecks
22 immigrants have died in ICE detention over last 2 years. 2 kids died in CBP custody in the last 2 months. 15,000 migrants kids are held in custody. Donald Trump is right that we face an urgent, horrifying humanitarian crisis. He just leaves out the part about him creating it.
