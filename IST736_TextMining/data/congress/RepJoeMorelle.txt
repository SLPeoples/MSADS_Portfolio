This week the @HouseDemocrats passed a historic bill in #HR1. We’re fighting to:Remove barriers to make it easier for all Americans to cast a ballot.Eliminate dark money in politics.Restore ethics and integrity to Washington.#ForthePeople
More than four million women in the US experience physical violence by an intimate partner every year. #VAWA is truly life-saving legislation - that's why I'm proud to join my colleagues to co-sponsor its immediate reauthorization.
I want my granddaughters to grow up never doubting that they are strong, they are smart, they are loved, and they can do anything they set their minds to. This #InternationalWomensDay let's remind young women everywhere that they are superheroes - and they are changing the world.
Today, @HouseDemocrats took historic steps to strengthen our democracy, clean up corruption, and make gov't work #ForThePeople by passing #HR1, which takes action to: Make it easier, not harder, to vote.Reduce the role of special interests.Restore ethics to Washington.
Proud to join my colleagues @RepDebDingell @RepBrianFitz and @cathymcmorris to introduce legislation that will help ensure aging Americans and individuals with disabilities have the resources and support to age in place safely and independently. Check out this fact sheet:
As we recognize #TNBC Awareness Day, which was earlier this week, I extend my support to the thousands of women and men affected by this devastating disease and highlight the need for continued education, research, and action to find a cure for breast cancer.
I am humbled to sponsor this resolution and help raise awareness for a cause near and dear to me and my family. My daughter, Lauren, battled triple negative breast cancer for two years with incredible courage and tenacity.
My first job in 1976 paid $2.30 an hour. Adjusted for inflation, that’s the equivalent of $10.76 today – MORE than our current federal minimum wage in the year 2019. It’s time to #RaiseTheWage.

Thank you to the @RocRedWings and @RITNTID for your dedication to fostering an accessible, inclusive community!
Today the @EdLaborCmte is examining the #RaiseTheWage Act, which would increase the minimum wage to $15 at the federal level. Last month, economist Ben Zipperer confirmed that this does nothing to hurt employment – but rather it uplifts and empowers those who need it.
I know all too well the devastating impact cancer can have on a family. Investments like this are essential to advancing research and education that will finally lead to a cure for this awful disease.
Pleased to announce that @UofR has been awarded a $3.4 M grant from @theNCI to support the ground-breaking medical research being done at @WilmotCancer and make clinical trials more accessible to patients. 
ICYMI: To commemorate the historic #HR1 bill the House is considering this week, I stopped by the 1872 Cafe in my hometown, which sits at the location where Susan B. Anthony cast her ballot – illegally – in the 1872 presidential election. #ForThePeople
Tomorrow, @RulesDemocrats will take up #HR1 to expand voting rights and get our government back to working #ForThePeople. To commemorate this historic legislation, I stopped by the 1872 Cafe, where Susan B. Anthony voted illegally and changed the voting reform movement forever.
Delighted to meet Angelica Perez-Delgado, the new President and CEO of @IberoRoc. I’m so grateful to Ibero for all that they do, and I look forward to working together as we continue our efforts to uplift and empower Rochester’s vibrant Latino community.
Cc: @HouseDemWomen. The future of our nation has never looked so bright!
As we kick off #WomensHistoryMonth, I am reminded of what an incredible privilege it is to serve in the 116th Congress alongside the largest number of women in history. Every day, these inspiring women prove just why representation matters.
We need bold action to address the crisis in our City schools. We can only accomplish this by working as a community which is why I am so proud to partner with @ROCtheFuture, Mayor Warren, and leaders throughout #Rochester to put our students on the path to success.
As we recognize #TNBCDay, I extend my support to the thousands of women and men affected by this devastating disease and highlight the need for continued education, research, and action to find a cure for breast cancer.
I’m humbled to sponsor a resolution designating today as National Triple Negative Breast Cancer Awareness Day, highlighting a cause near and dear to me and my family. My daughter, Lauren, battled #TNBC for two years with incredible courage and tenacity. #TNBCDay
I often find myself in a book at the end of a long day and believe reading to be one of the most empowering, thought-provoking activities. In honor of #ReadAcrossAmerica Day, I sat down with my granddaughter, Arabella, to read one of her favorite stories.
Let us renew our commitment to giving back to our veterans and military service members who have given so much to all of us, and ensure they continue to have access to the essential support and resources they need and deserve.
Thank you to the @RedCrossWCNY for hosting today's Military Salute. It is so important that we take time to recognize and thank the brave men and women who serve our nation, their families, and the many organizations dedicated to providing care for veterans in our community.
Enjoyed the chance to sit down with very talented students at @EastEpo to learn about their exciting hands-on optics and photonics education program. By inspiring students early, we are poised to further cement Rochester's place as a global leader in this important field.
Always enjoy when I can swing by the Italian American Sports Club dinner. Thanks so much for having me!
Great afternoon meeting with @FairportVillage Mayor @JulieDomaratz and @PittsfordTown Supervisor Bill Smith! I’m thankful to have such dedicated partners in local government as we work together to improve the lives of Monroe County families.
The Erie Canal is an iconic symbol of opportunity that forever changed New York’s economy. Thank you to the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor for their investment which will showcase the canal’s rich history support new educational opportunities throughout our community.
The President’s tax reforms were an assault on the middle class – especially middle class New Yorkers. I’m grateful to @NYGovCuomo for his dedication to our community and look forward to working together to eliminate the SALT cap and provide relief for middle-class families.
Proud of the common-sense legislation my colleagues and I passed this week to help #EndGunViolence. Thank you to @WhipClyburn and @RepThompson for your leadership on #HR1112 and #HR8. Together, we can end this epidemic.
Delighted to announce that @Lifespan_RochNY has been awarded over $100,000 in funding through the @NationalService @SeniorCorps program to support the critical work they do to serve our aging population. Thank you Lifespan for all you do for our community!
It's not too much to ask that gun buyers wait 10 days before being cleared to own a deadly weapon. Closing the #CharlestonLoophole is a perfect example of common sense legislation the federal gov't can enact and I am proud to support this bill. #HR1112
I am so proud to cast my vote for this historic legislation. Not just thoughts and prayers – but real, sensible, bipartisan legislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands. There is much more work still to be done, but #HR8 is an important step forward to ending #GunViolence.
Together, we can end gun violence. Today, we take one step closer. #HR8
#GunViolence is an epidemic that for too long has gone unaddressed at the federal level -- but that stops today. I urge my colleagues to vote yes on #HR8 and take an important, bipartisan step to #EndGunViolence by ensuring background checks on all gun sales.
As we end #BlackHistoryMonth, I was honored to witness the portrait unveiling of an incredible Rochestarian, iconic American, and leader of the abolitionist movement: Frederick Douglass. Let us uphold his legacy through our tireless work to ensure equality for every American.
The President's emergency declaration is a gross abuse of power - that's why tonight, my colleagues and I took action to terminate the #FakeEmergency, uphold the constitution, and protect the fundamental system of checks and balances our nation was built upon. My full statement:

I am proud to join @HouseDemocrats in reducing barriers to the ballot box by co-sponsoring #HR4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act. Together we will ensure no one is barred from participating in democracy. #RestoreTheVote
Access to the voting booth is one of the most sacred, empowering rights we have as Americans. Casting a vote is the lifeblood of our democracy and it is vital that everyone has the ability to make their voice heard. #RestoreTheVote
This appalling and inhumane practice is entirely out of touch with our nation’s values — the President must be held accountable for his refusal to reunite children with their families.
This #BlackHistoryMonth we remember Amelia Boynton Robinson-a matriarch of the voting rights movement who was tireless in her pursuit of equality. It is our responsibility to uphold her legacy by continuing to fight for the right to vote for

The threat of power outages, flooding, and road blockages is serious and we will continue to closely monitor the situation. I urge everyone to heed the warnings from our authorities, remain vigilant, and above all, stay safe.
Thank you to @NYGovCuomo for being here today in the face of yet another extreme weather system. The close collaboration we see among all levels of government is exactly what we need in times like these to ensure our residents are safe and prepared for tomorrow’s windstorm.
High winds this weekend could cause widespread power outages – be prepared with this guide from the @RedCross and remember to keep an eye out for emergency updates from law enforcement and your local
Excited that #Rochester is hosting this year’s @SpecialOlympics NY Winter Games! It was a joy to meet the athletes and see my good friend Stacey Hengsterman. Best of luck to everyone competing this weekend!
The Trump administration continues to wage an unrelenting war on the rights of women. @HouseDemocrats will always defend a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions. We will fight tirelessly to #SaveTitleX and protect the millions of Americans who depend on it for care.
New York has always been a leader in green energy and innovative technology – @PlugPowerInc continues that legacy by leveraging our core assets to invest in advanced manufacturing that strengthens our local economy while working towards a cleaner, more sustainable future.
Neighbors and businesses are still struggling to recover from the 2017 flooding - and now, lake levels are nearly 14 inches higher than average. Today I sent a letter urging the IJC to address these dangerous levels and develop a long-term plan to reduce risk of future floods.
Meteorologists are anticipating damaging wind speeds this weekend, similar to what we saw in 2017. Stay alert to local advisories and be prepared with enough food and water. Have emergency contact numbers close by. #NYWx
Congrats to my dear friend Hilda Rosario Escher on your retirement! You are a true asset to our community — we are all grateful for your steadfast leadership of @IberoRoc and dedication to #Rochester’s Latino community.
SNAP recipients are still reeling from the impacts of the government shutdown, leaving vulnerable families without access to meals. Grateful to @FoodlinkNY for expanding food distributions today to accommodate #SNAPGap and ensure food security for those in need in our community.
And that's why I'm proud to co-sponsor #HR8 as well as other legislation to expand background checks, ban assault weapons, prohibit bump stocks, and get illegal guns off our streets.
The scourge of #gunviolence is a true crisis that thoughts and prayers won't solve -- but strong, sensible legislation can. I appreciate everyone from @MomsDemand who joined me today to discuss how we can take action to enact common-sense gun reforms. #EnoughIsEnough
Thanks to the visitors at Henrietta Senior Center for spending your lunch chatting with me about what’s going on in Congress and the importance of protecting and expanding essential programs like Medicare and Social Security.
I want to thank my partners in government @SenSchumer, @LtGovHochulNY and @NYGovCuomo for their steadfast commitment to showcasing all that Upstate NY and the Rochester community has to offer residents and businesses alike

Now that we’ve come to an agreement to prevent a government shutdown, it’s time to get back to work on the issues Americans care about. #ForThePeople
My heart is with the people of #Aurora as yet another community suffers the devastation of #gunviolence. This is a REAL emergency that demands our immediate attention and action. #EnoughIsEnough
The president’s declaration of a fraudulent national emergency is a gross abuse of power that violates our nation’s constitution and subverts the will of the American people and his coequal partners in government. My full statement:
Today we honor the birthday and celebrate the life of Rochester’s very own #SusanBAnthony, a tireless champion of women’s rights who made incredible strides in the fight for equality and paved the way for the many strong, courageous women leading our community and country today.
Now, it is my hope that we continue this renewed spirit of bipartisanship as we return our focus to governing and addressing the important issues facing our nation.
It is, however, unfortunate that as #Congress has demonstrated a clear desire and ability to work together in a bipartisan manner, this President continues to subvert the will of the American people and his coequal partners in government.
I am pleased that we have reached a bipartisan agreement to prevent another government #shutdown as well as returned to a productive dialogue and constructive tone that seeks to unite, not further divide us.
Just sent a letter to @amazon CEO @JeffBezos, urging he consider Rochester as a potential location for future expansion of Amazon. Our community boasts a rich history of innovation and entrepreneurship and would provide Amazon with the right atmosphere to grow and thrive.
I join all Americans in strongly condemning this act of hate and terrorism, and my heart is with those affected by the #KashmirTerrorAttack. We must continue working to confront and defeat terror in every corner of the world.

It doesn’t just take a village – it takes a school. Students go to school not only to learn in a classroom setting, but to get essential services they may not have access to at home. These staff are a valuable resource to ensure all students are given an opportunity to thrive.
"Non-teacher" staff does not mean "non-essential." School psychologists, reading specialists, and librarians (aka "non-teacher" staff) play a critical role in child development, particularly if a child lives in poverty, has experienced trauma, or faces crisis at home.
33 years after it was first awarded, Gwendolyn Brooks became the first black author to receive a Pulitzer Prize. This #BlackHistoryMonth let us celebrate literary pioneers whose words have helped shape who we are as a nation.
Today I join my colleagues, and the families of Flight 3407, in urging Transportation Secretary Chao to put the safety and well-being of passengers first by implementing the Pilot Records Database to ensure the safety of our skies and of the American people.
On the 10th anniversary of the #Flight3407 tragedy, may we honor the memories of the innocent lives lost by ensuring we make permanent critical and essential aviation safety standards that ensure only qualified, responsible pilots are navigating our skies.
When a new child is born or a medical crisis strikes, the last thing workers should have to worry about is how to make ends meet. The #FAMILYAct will ensure families have peace of mind when they need it most. #paidleave
In the New York State Assembly, I was proud to help pass the nation’s most comprehensive paid family leave program. Now we need to ensure every working family in America receives that same essential support and security - that’s why I’m so proud to co-sponsor the #FAMILYAct.
Just want to say that ALL teachers have a friend in me in Congress — but being married to a retired middle school English teacher makes me a little partial to the work they do ��️
Happening now ️ I'm participating in the @EdLaborCmte hearing and discussing the need to invest $100 billion in our nation's public schools and ensure every student has the resources to make their dreams a reality.
Tune in to today's @EdLaborCmte meeting where we discuss how under-funded public education has hindered teacher pay, infrastructure and access to quality educational resources.
The reality is, #climatechange is happening – and it’s happening now. Yet, the Trump administration continues to dismantle essential EPA standards and protections and prioritize profit-driven special interests over the health and safety of our planet.
There is no place in our country for anti-Semitism or for bigoted, hateful rhetoric of any kind. Elected officials have an obligation to lead by example and demonstrate that we have zero tolerance for any and all forms of prejudice, discrimination and racism.
In coming days, we must come together in good faith to prevent another disaster and work towards a bipartisan deal that provides the certainty and stability American families deserve. #NoShutdown
American Families cannot afford to endure another needless and costly government #shutdown – nor can our economy, which has already suffered $3B in damages. Another shutdown would leave a permanent scar on our nation and will never help us solve the complex issues we face.
Today marks 55 years since the #CivilRights Act passed the House of Representatives. The bill became law later that year. The road to equality remains long, but today we recognize the strides we have made and recommit to continuing the fight for equal rights for every American.
These weapons then flow onto the streets and into the hands of dangerous criminals, posing a clear threat to public safety. That is why the DOJ and AFT must play a central role in combating this serious issue that is plaguing our community and communities across the country.
#ICYMI Last week I sent a letter to Acting AG Whitaker calling on him to take action to address the growing instances of gun shop burglaries. Last year, a local gun shop in Rochester was burglarized twice in one week -- and seven times since 2007 alone.
I had a chance to speak with Terrance Wise, a fast food worker from Kansas City, on how unexpected emergencies can derail a family in dire financial straits. He is but one example of how we can help people by raising the minimum wage. #RaiseTheWage
Grateful to join the dedicated and courageous men and women of @brightonfd as we wish Chief MacAdam well on his next journey. Thank you to Chief MacAdam and all of our firefighters for your dedicated service to keeping our community safe!
Just swung by the Lakeside Winter Celebration. Always a good time getting out to one of the many wonderful community events we have here in Rochester — and thanks for the chili!
Here in #NY25 and across New York State, we know how important it is to #RaiseTheWage and create an economy that puts workers first. And we will not stop fighting until every worker in America is finally paid a living wage.
We face a clear threat to our national safety. We need improved leadership within the ATF, a stronger commitment to gun shop safety, and decisive action to prevent violators from retaining their federal licenses to sell dangerous weapons. #GunLawsSaveLives #EndGunViolence
These dangerous weapons enter the black market and underground weapons pipelines where they are sold on the order of thousands of dollars. The local shops are rarely held accountable for failing to secure their firearms and the situation never abated.
Here in Monroe County, one gun shop has been burglarized seven times since 2007. Nationwide, more than 575 gun shops were burglarized in 2017, releasing thousands of guns into the streets and into the hands of criminals. #EndGunViolence
Our nation is facing a devastating gun violence epidemic that is exacerbated by growing instances of gun shop burglaries. Today I called on Acting AG Whitaker to take immediate action to address this crisis that is threatening the safety of our
No veteran should be forced to choose between caring for their child and getting the medical treatment they need. That's why the House just passed legislation to expand #ChildCare4Vets and ensure nothing stands between our courageous veterans and critical lifesaving services.

Nice try, @cspan. I'm a big fan of southern hospitality but I'm staying put in our great state of New York.

That’s why I co-sponsored the Social Security 2100 Act to take immediate action to safeguard access and ensure the long term viability of #SocialSecurity for generations to come.
President Trump’s #SOTU failed to put forth a plan to strengthen and expand #SocialSecurity #Medicare. No one should have to work their whole life only to have the rug pulled out from underneath them — at all costs, we must protect the promise and commitment of these programs.
Education is the single best investment we can make in our community. Our top priority should be the future of our children—the ways in which we can cultivate innovative and equitable approaches to the challenges of a new tomorrow. Proud to serve on the House @EdLaborCmte
Pleased to have the opportunity to meet with members of @dfitogether from my hometown @irondequoit_ny to discuss how we can prevent substance abuse and address the devastating opioid crisis. I look forward to continuing our work together to create stronger, healthier communities.
With every one of our neighbors, children, and loved ones who are ripped from us by gun violence comes another tragic reminder that #EnoughisEnough. Congress has a responsibility to act, and I am proud that today the #116th held the first gun reform hearings in eight years. 3/3
Nowhere in last night's #SOTU did the President address our urgent need for bipartisan, commonsense gun safety reform. 2/3
39,773That's how many people died from gun violence in 2017. Change comes from action—not thoughts and prayers. That's why my colleagues and I are proud to introduce #HR8, legislation that implement necessary background checks to keep guns out of the wrong hands. (1/3)
I'm proud to represent a state that recognizes a woman's healthcare decision is solely between her and her doctor. My colleagues and I in the House will always stand up to protect that essential right and fight back against any actions that infringe on a woman's right to choose.
Last night's #SOTU continued this administration's unrelenting assault on the rights of women by advancing an anti-choice agenda that takes aim at New York State for acting to uphold #RoevWade and protect women's reproductive rights.

� HAPPENING RIGHT NOW: House Committee hearings on gun violence, climate change, and pre-existing conditions. Here in the new House, we dont‘ just talk - we take action and get to work #ForThePeople.
Actions, not empty promises, are what matter most to the American people. Last night’s #SOTU was merely lip service. Today my colleagues on @EdLaborCmte and I are taking action on the critical need to expand access to healthcare, especially for those with pre-existing conditions.
Yesterday, the President failed to address the serious effects of #climatechange that are threatening the health of our planet. Thankfully, @HouseDemocrats are taking the lead on this crisis by holding climate change hearings today - the first hearings in 8 years. #ActOnClimate
Tonight, the President demonstrated he clearly fails to understand that you cannot achieve unity while advancing an agenda that further inflames political divisions, stigmatizes our differences, and altogether bypasses the will of the American people. #SOTU
We are still recovering from the last #TrumpShutdown. Americans cannot afford another one — quite literally. The state of America’s infrastructure is dire. Investments are long overdue. I hope our president takes time to acknowledge this critical issue. #ny25priorities
45 minutes left until the #SOTU. I want to know what you’re hoping to hear. Respond with the hashtag #ny25priorities.

And in that vein, it is alarming yet unsurprising that a former coal industry lobbyist has appointed someone to the EPA board who once said “I see neither the developing catastrophe nor the smoking gun proving that human activity is to blame for most of the warming we see.”
With each passing day, we gather more information that says #climatechange is not only real but that it‘s here NOW. Yet this President and administration continue to refuse acknowledging the dire consequences of their policies and action — or lackthereof.
President Trump's cruel immigration policies remain disturbingly out of touch with America's values. @HouseDemocrats will work to ensure this administration is held accountable for its continued failure reuniting children with their families. #FamiliesBelongTogether

After a lifetime of hard work and paying into the system, everyone deserves to enter their later years with peace of mind that #SocialSecurity will be there. I'm proud to cosponsor legislation to safeguard access ensure long-term viability of this essential program. #Secure2100

Across the Northeast, we are facing historically low and dangerous temperatures. Please take necessary precautions to remain safe, stay alert to updates in your local community, and be prepared in the event of an emergency.
Ten years ago, President Obama signed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. This historic bill took a step towards helping women achieve #PaycheckFairness but the battle is far from over.As we celebrate #Ledbetter10, we commit to continuing thefight for #equalpay for equal work.
Busy day bouncing back and forth between committee meetings — thinking about introducing a bill to allow me to be in two places at once. At least my Fitbit says I’ve gotten a lot of steps!
Excited to serve on @EdLaborCmte subcommittees on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education and Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions! Grateful that I will be part of the critical work to support and strengthen families in our community and across the nation.
Our families deserve better. I will continue to work towards enacting fiscally responsible solutions that put the needs of everyday Americans over corporate profits and special interests.
The @USCBO report @HouseBudgetDems just heard emphasized what we already knew: the disastrous Trump tax plan will add trillions of dollars to our deficit that will be placed squarely on the backs of hardworking, middle-class Americans.

Tune in now to the first hearing of 2019! ️️️
This President is committed to spreading fear among immigrant minority populations and undermining participation in the #census. @HouseDemocrats and I will continue to fight back against these attacks on our values and ensure every person who calls this nation home is counted.
#SCOTUS has made it perfectly clear that adding President Trump's desired citizenship question to the census is unlawful and would lead to the intimidation and disenfranchisement of immigrant communities in both New York and across the nation.
Hard-working American families are paying the price as the effects of the shutdown continue to ravage our economy.
With that, we must not forget that the President's deal is only short term. In the coming days, I will be working tirelessly with my colleagues to ensure a bipartisan deal is reached that provides the certainty and stability American families deserve.
After 35 days of the #TrumpShutdown, I'm on my way back to D.C. to start the week. We're ready to focus on making health care affordable for all, reducing gun violence, and all the critical challenges you sent me to Congress to fight for.

As #HolocaustMemorialDay comes to a close, let us honor the memories of the six million innocent lives lost. Hate and intolerance have no place in our society, and we must continue to tirelessly fight back against those who seek to divide us. #WeRemember #HolocaustRemembrance
Stopped by Brighton Volunteer Ambulance for their first Open House showing off their newly renovated and expanded base! Thank you to everyone at BVA for your hard work and dedication to keeping our community safe.

Congratulations to Maia and Anirudh on their truly remarkable achievements and on receiving this prestigious recognition! Thanks to @UofR for enabling their success by allowing them to leverage groundbreaking tech research taking place at the Laser Lab. 
Had a blast at @irondequoit_ny #Winterfest2019 with my grandkids - and even got to run into Assemblywoman @RomeohRomeo! Thanks to Supervisor @daveseeley430 for hosting another year of winter fun that is one of many reasons Irondequoit is such a wonderful place to call home.

No better way to start a Saturday morning than at the #Roc Public Market! Great to see so many people out shopping local and supporting our community’s agricultural economy.
While I am relieved that we can finally re-open the government, I am profoundly disappointed that it has come to this point. In three weeks’ time, we cannot allow the American people to find themselves staring down yet another shutdown. My full statement:
On what should be a payday, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are missing their second paychecks – leaving them with no way to pay for rent, groceries, daycare, and more. How much longer must Americans suffer as a consequence of the #TrumpShutdown?
RT @HouseBudgetDems: Welcome to the House Budget Committee, @RepJoeMorelle.
Congratulations to my dear friend Hilda Rosario-Escher of @IberoRoc as well as Shaquana Divers of @ExcellusBCBS and @HCRtips on their #RocAthena awards! Our entire community is grateful for your leadership and dedicated
If the Senate and the President were truly worried about the safety and well-being of Americans, they would join us in passing this legislation to re-open the Department of Homeland Security immediately and #EndTheShutdown.
Border patrol agents, members of the Coast Guard, transportation security officers and more are going without pay while critical security operations are stymied nationwide. That's why today the House passed legislation to fund DHS and ensure employees receive back pay.
