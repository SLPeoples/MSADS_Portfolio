After failing to convince the American people or Congress to pay for his ineffective border wall, the President is now trying to bypass our constitutional legislative process to get his way. This action is lawless and unconstitutional.
The President's declaration creates a crisis that does not exist, it would require the seizure of hundreds of miles of private and state-owned land would take billions from high-priority military construction projects that ensure our troops have essential training readiness.
As lawmakers, it is our duty to protect our constitution, the separation of powers and defend our nation against this gross abuse of authority. That's why I voted to terminate the President's national emergency declaration.

To all the Dreamers across Colorado: keep up the fight. Our state and country benefit greatly from your courage and dedication. I will do my part in Congress to ensure we pass permanent protections that will allow you to work, drive, and live free from the fear of deportation!
#DACA recipients are integral to communities across Colorado, which is why I will continue to work to ensure that Dreamers and their family members can thrive. Their dedication and contributions are good for Colorado’s economy and our future.
Unfortunately, due to the actions of the Trump administration, these hard-working Coloradans could face deportation now that #DACA + #TPS have been rescinded.
I met a mother with #TPS who arrived in the United States in 2001 after an earthquake struck El Salvador. She's now an integral part of her community in Colorado.
I also spoke to a @TeachForAmerica alumna, whose passion for teaching is driven by her desire to see the next generation of Coloradans grow and learn each and every day.
One of the Dreamers I spoke with is an Eagle Scout, father, and college student who works full-time to provide for his family and complete his Bachelor’s Degree in Sustainability Studies.
These bright young Dreamers currently contribute more than $31 million dollars in state + local taxes annually and wish to use their talents to take their communities (and Colorado) to greater heights.
Earlier today, I had the opportunity to hear the stories of several #DACA and #TPS recipients who reside all across our great state of Colorado.
