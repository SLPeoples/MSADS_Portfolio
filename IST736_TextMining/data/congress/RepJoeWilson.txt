Specifically, this legislation allows Coverdell Education Savings Accounts to be used on home school educational expenses. It is our duty to expand opportunities for the education of our heroes’ children and offer these families the support they deserve.
Because of frequent moves and a lack of school choice, children in military families feel the negative impact. This is why I introduced the Military Child Educational Freedom Act today.
Our brave women and men in uniform fight on the front lines for our freedom. Not only are we grateful to our heroes, but also to their families for their service. The average child in a military family moves six to nine times in his or her school career.
Today I introduced legislation to support school choice for children of active duty members in the United States Armed Forces (H.R. 740). More info:

Unfortunately, the Kingdom has not lived up to its promises. The Saudi Educational Transparency and Reform Act of 2019 requires the U.S. State Department to review Saudi textbooks annually and ensure that Riyadh is upholding its pledge to peace.

Last night on the House floor, I highlighted the press conferences for our 2019 Legislative Agenda Tour in the Midlands, Aiken, and Barnwell. This year, I will work to create jobs and economic growth, support conservative alternatives, and achieve foreign affairs opportunities.
This resolution reaffirms the Jewish people’s connection to Jerusalem, and supports Israel and the United States’ decision to withdraw from UNESCO this year as a result of the organization’s clear bias against the Jewish state.
Unfortunately, the UNESCO has repeatedly passed resolutions that fly in the face of the historical and archaeological records in an effort to minimize or erase the history of the Jewish people in their most-sacred city.
Today, I released the following statement after introducing a resolution to reassert the connection between the Jewish people and the city of Jerusalem:The connection of the Jewish people to the ancient city of Jerusalem is an indisputable historical fact.
Today, I presented my 2019 Legislative Agenda across the Second Congressional District of South Carolina, visiting in the Midlands, Aiken, and Barnwell. More information here:
