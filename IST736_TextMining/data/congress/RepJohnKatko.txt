I am heartened to see Congress take these issues seriously, and will continue to advocate for these bipartisan reforms. (4/4)
While I could not vote in support of this measure today, it incorporates legislation I worked on to improve election security and to protect our elections from foreign interference. (3/4)
But the bill before the House today represents a significant constitutional overreach that would attempt to establish a publicly funded electoral system, which I staunchly oppose. (2/4)
I strongly believe we need campaign finance reform, and acted on the first day of this Congress to introduce a bipartisan constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and impose campaign contribution limits. (1/4)
This is the second vote taken this Congress addressing antisemitic comments and I hope the House does not need to consider additional legislation on this matter. (2/2)
Hateful rhetoric against the Jewish members of our community has no place in our society. I voted in favor of the resolution on the floor today condemning bigoted speech towards religious, racial, and ethnic groups. (1/2)
