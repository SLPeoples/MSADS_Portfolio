Had a great meeting yesterday with the @PVA1946. We had a good conversation about the Social Security 2100 Act and the special needs of veterans with spinal cord injuries.
On #InternationalWomensDay, we celebrate and honor the contributions of women across the globe. I’m proud to stand alongside women woman in their fight to break down barriers and empower girls all around the world.
Today I’m proud to be voting for #HR1, a bill that will put political power back in the hands of the people. Proud to have helped lay the groundwork for this legislation. #ForThePeople
#TBT to when Sam Waterston visited the Hill in support of my Fair Elections Now Act. FENA laid the groundwork for the #ForThePeople Act that the House votes on tomorrow. Let’s pass #ElectionReform! #HR1
There’s a fierce urgency of now to address our nation’s crumbling infrastructure. Yesterday’s @WaysMeansCmte hearing was about laying the groundwork for much needed federal infrastructure legislation to fund transformational projects, like the I-84/I-91 Tunnel Proposal.
ATTENTION 16-25 YEAR OLDS: The @ObamaFoundation has chosen to invest in and support young people in Hartford. Our young leaders are eager to make a difference. The deadline is March 24th to apply!
Maria Colón Sánchez, the first Hispanic woman elected to the Connecticut General Assembly in 1988, was a pioneer and changemaker in Hartford. She left a legacy of empowering Hartford's Puerto Rican community through political activism #WomensHistoryMonth #CT01
#Throwback to 2013 when I led the Task Force on Election Reform, which laid the groundwork for many of the reforms in #HR1. #HR1 puts the electoral power back in the hands of the people. #ForthePeople
Great meeting with members of the CT VFW with @RepJoeCourtney today about veterans issues that they’re concerned about! Thank you for your service!
I am honored to have been able to call Dr. Ed Zigler a mentor and a friend.
This morning I helped launch Connecticut’s #2020Census efforts with @LGSusanB, @SOTSMerrill, @HPLCT, others! Having a complete and accurate census is vital to ensuring Connecticut receives its fair share of federal resources.
Great seeing cadets from CT's Civil Air Patrol today. You all have bright futures ahead of you!
In 2015, 9 innocent worshipers lost their lives at the Emanuel AME Church. Today, the House voted to close the loophole that enabled the shooter to purchase a firearm. #HR1112 #HonorWithAction
Congratulations to @KellyNPS, the new Superintendent of Coltsville National Historical Park Springfield Armory National Historic Site, who brings along a proven track record of building partnerships 30+ yrs of experience working within @NatlParkService. Welcome to Hartford!
Proud to stand with the CT Delegation on this historic day. Congress has taken action and the House has passed Universal Background Checks. It’s time for the Senate to do the same. #HonorWithAction #EndGunViolence �: @jahimes
It’s time we act to address these true emergencies, and for Congress to reassert its Constitutional authority over this executive overreach. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to do what is right and end this Emergency Declaration.
This is about Congress reasserting its Constitutional authority. We need border security comprehensive immigration reform, but it’s clear this is not a National Emergency. What is a National Emergency in our country is the gun violence epidemic, opioid epidemic climate change
ATTENTION: The Hartford and Torrington Social Security offices are closed for the time being due to a facilities issue. We will post when the offices are opened again.
Proud to join 225 of my colleagues in moving to block POTUS’s National Emergency. The real emergency is the gun violence epidemic that’s afflicting our country.
63 years ago, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., and nearly 100 other Americans protested the segregated bus system. We’ve come a long way, but we still have a lot of work to do. #BlackHistoryMonth #MontgomeryBusBoycott
Social Security isn’t an entitlement, it’s the insurance you’ve paid for with every paycheck. Great discussion with the CT State Employees Association about the Social Security 2100 Act. #Secure2100
RT @RepJoeCourtney: #HealthCare Social Service workers face out-sized amounts of violence at the workplace. Proud to introduce #HR1309 w/…
Great conversation tonight with @HYPEHartford! It was great discussing the I-84/I-91 Tunnel proposal and more.
Thanks to all who came out to tonight’s forum on the #GOPTaxLaw

Today @SenStabenow @SenatorBaldwin @RepJoeCourtney @RepBrianHiggins @PeterWelch I intro'd a bold, commonsense solution, the #MedicareBuyIn Act. It allows those ages 50-64 to buy into Medicare, lowering costs it allows Medicare to negotiate w drug companies, lowering Rx prices
How has the #GOPTaxLaw affected you?  Many CT residents are now being double-taxed. Share your story here:
BREAKING: The I-91/I-84 interchange has moved up to the 14th worst in the country! We need a plan that will solve the region’s infrastructure challenges. The I-84/I-91 Tunnel Proposal is about solutions.
I also enjoyed meeting with Nija and Kaitlyn with Connecticut Women's Education and Legal Fund (CWEALF)’s paid leave campaign today to discuss the importance of #PaidLeave.
In 1987, I was proud to author the nation’s first Family and Medical Leave Act in the CT State Senate. FMLA is vital for millions of Americans. It is time we pass paid FMLA, I am proud to support @rosadelauro’s #FAMILYAct!
The Republican tax law is affecting thousands of Americans this tax season, including many in CT. Many are now being double-taxed because the State and Local Tax Deduction cap. Proud to join @BillPascrell’s bill to restore the full deduction.
The rising cost of prescription drugs are bankrupting American families – this isn’t a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It’s an American one – and it’s one that we’re committed to fixing. Watch today’s hearing on it here:
#IRS is now accepting/processing tax returns. Free help filing returns is available for taxpayers w low to moderate incomes, taxpayers who are elderly, taxpayers w limited English proficiency. To locate a volunteer tax assistance site near you, visit:
#ClimateChange isn’t something we can kick down the road any longer, we need to take serious measures to address this issue head on. This isn’t a partisan issue, this is about facts science. I am proud to cosponsor the #GreenNewDeal as we work to make this a reality.
Today’s hearing was the start of the conversation. We’re facing a retirement crisis and Social Security is a bedrock program for millions of Americans. That’s why I’m working to strengthen Social Security and increase benefits with Social Security 2100. #Secure2100

Bryan Hall, Chairman of the East Hartford Board of Education, extended an olive branch to Secretary DeVos and invited her once again to visit E. Hartford.
Yesterday, I joined federal aviation workers at Bradley to stand in solidarity with them. I’ve voted 11 times to reopen the government. It’s time for the Senate to join the House in passing a bill to reopen the government. #EndtheShutdownNow

It is unconscionable that our air traffic controllers, TSA agents, border patrol, other dedicated employees are set to miss a 2nd paycheck. The House has voted 10 times to reopen the govt. I urge every Senator to support the CR that would reopen the govt and #EndTheShutdownNow
Today I again voted to reopen the Federal Government. Every day the government remains shuttered, the consequences become more severe and the burden placed on federal workers and contractors becomes heavier.
Social Security IS the nation's most effective anti-poverty program! Thank you to Nancy Altman and @SSWorks for highlighting how Social Security aligns with the vision of Dr. King.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. told us that "Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men". Today, I join men and women across the nation in remembering Dr. King by recommitting ourselves to that effort for human progress.
Social Security is a lifeline for millions of Americans. Share your story on how it’s helped you or a family member here: 
Thank you to Kelly Evans for having me on @CNBCTheExchange to talk what the House is doing to #EndTheShutdownNow and how the @WaysMeansCmte will operate this Congress.
Social Security isn’t an entitlement, it is the insurance YOU’VE paid for! Please share your story on how Social Security has helped you or a loved one
It is outrageous that POTUS would consider diverting disaster relief for  Puerto Rico to pay for his border wall. This idea should be abandoned  immediately.   
The House will continue to take action to re-open these departments and fund Department of Agriculture. The Senate must take up this bill and #EndTheShutdownNow
The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is closed, so breweries can’t introduce new beer. Bad for beer fans and bad for small businesses!
Hundreds of food inspectors have been furloughed, putting our food safety at risk.
Small farmers can’t get access to loans to buy supplies for 2019, potentially disrupting an entire year of planting.
The FDA is unable to review new prescription drugs, delaying potentially lifesaving treatment from getting to those who need them.
Today, the House of Representatives voted to re-open the Department of Agriculture (again). Below are some of the vital programs that are impacted by the shutdown. #Thread
This list is just an example of SOME of the pre-existing conditions people used to be denied health care for. The GOP is trying to overturn these critical protections. We can’t let that happen, that’s why Democrats are working to improve access to health care. #ProtectOurCare
Welcome and congratulations to our new Governor, @GovNedLamont and Lt. Governor @LGSusanB! All the best to you both, I’m excited to see what your administration will do!
Thank you to @GovMalloyOffice and @LGWyman for many years of service to the State of Connecticut.
Gun violence isn’t just mass shootings. Nearly 40,000 Americans died last year as a result of gun violence, some in our own backyard. I’m proud to join Democrats in introducing commonsense background check laws. #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain
It’s time for Congressional Republicans and the President to join us in reopening the government now. Let’s have a debate about border security and about comprehensive immigration reform, but let’s do it with the government open instead of taking the America people hostage.
Last night, the President used fear tactics instead of facts, as @SpeakerPelosi said. The new House majority has already passed legislation that would end the shutdown.
The American people are already feeling the effects of the govt shutdown it will only get worse if it continues. Yesterday, I met an air traffic controller at Bradley Airport who is going w/o pay to keep the traveling public safe. Many of his colleagues have been furloughed.
It makes no sense to shutdown the government and not pay the very people in charge of protecting our borders. It’s time to reopen the government and pay our workers what they’ve earned.
It’s time to reopen government. The House passed legislation last week to do just that and fund Homeland Security, the IRS, the FAA and more. The House will act again this week. I won’t stop fighting until the government is reopened. #EndTheShutdown
Bryan works at Bradley Tower in Windsor Locks where 40 controllers are working hard without pay to keep the traveling public safe. That’s in addition to FAA aviation specialists who are furloughed. #ShutdownStories
It was a pleasure meeting Air Traffic Controllers Bryan Krampovitis and Kevin Coeyman, who are keeping our airways safe without a paycheck during the #Shutdown.
ATTENTION! If you or someone you know has a #CrumblingFoundation, applications go live on THURSDAY to apply for reimbursement and repair funding. PLEASE SHARE!
It was great meeting with @IndvisibleConn yesterday to discuss the upcoming Congress and the new Democratic majority. Thank you for taking the time to come in. I look forward to working with you on Social Security, election reform, and fighting climate change!
Today I voted to re-open the govt. From the beginning, workers have been political pawns. The House, led by Democrats has approved legislation that re-opens the govt. It’s time for this shutdown to end for us to get to work.
I was also especially proud to support @SpeakerPelosi today. She is the first woman and first Italian-American to be Speaker of the House. She has been an strong leader on climate change, election reform, health care, and Social Security, and a dear friend for many years.
Today, the People’s House returned to the people. Over the past 2 yrs Americans have used their voices to stop the repeal of the ACA elect dozens of Democrats to the halls of Congress. We will restore regular order and bring on commonsense solutions to help the American people.
I'm honored to be sworn in again. Serving the people of #CT01 in Congress continues to be one of the greatest privileges of my life. I am also thrilled to welcome the newest member of the CT Delegation to Congress, Jahana Hayes, who is a true leader fighter for the people of CT
1 yr ago the #GOPTaxBill became law. It was rushed thru Congress absent of regular order has had a huge impact on CT, where middle-class families are paying the burden by being double-taxed. In Jan. we’ll fight for real reform for hard-working American workers their families.
Read my full statement here:
Between Secretary Mattis resigning, the President pulling troops out of Syria and Afghanistan, and the stock market plunging, the President’s decision to have a government shutdown over a border wall is throwing our country into chaos. This is not the way to run our country.
Border security is imperative in our nation, however building a $5 billion wall is not the answer and not the security measures our country would need. This funding is a waste of American taxpayers’ hard-earned money.
#TBT when I fought for women’s Social Security benefits on the floor, and in committee. This fight isn’t over and I will continue to fight for women so they can receive the insurance that they paid into!
Japan’s announcement to purchase 105 additional F-35s is great news for CT’s manufactures and nearly 3000 high-skilled workers who directly contribute to the program. The F-35 represents the very best of American ingenuity. Keep the eagle flying!
The banning of bump stocks is the least that can be done to limit the ease of committing mass murder, and we will take up more sensible gun safety measures next year in the House. #EndGunViolence 
The Las Vegas shooter fired 90 rounds every 10 seconds using bump stocks, ultimately killing 59, and wounding hundreds.

I couldn’t agree more. If you worked hard your whole life and paid into the system, you should never retire into poverty. I’ll be leading the fight in Congress to protect and improve Social Security
As Nancy Altman states - “Older workers who retire with adequate income allow younger employees to advance, and demonstrate to those younger workers that, after a lifetime of hard and loyal work, they too will be secure in old age.”
There’s still time to find a plan before Dec 15th! If you still need info and assistance finding a plan – there will be enrollment fairs happening around the state this Saturday with ride-share discounts, to boot!

Dr. Billington was a national treasure and this is a great loss to the country. Here are a few photos from when we worked together. He even came up to East Hartford for a visit!
He was the sage of the nation, the epitome of intellect, grace, and class. He was all that you would want in the Librarian of Congress, the gate keeper of truth and the cumulative knowledge of the nation’s heritage, culture, and literature.
I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Dr. James Billington last week. Dr. Billington was the 13th Librarian of Congress @librarycongress. Working with him was like working with a mixture of Gandolf and Dumbledore, because of his knowledge and wisdom.

155 years ago today, President Lincoln traveled to PA to honor those who died in the bloodiest battle of the Civil War. In only 272 words and in 2 minutes, he defined sacrifice, service and spoke to our better angels to unify the country once again.  #GettysburgAddress #155th
Social Security isn’t an entitlement - it’s the insurance we as Americans pay for over a lifetime of work. Here’s a  clip to when I confronted the Heritage Foundation on this issue. #TBT
With 10k Baby Boomers retiring a day, we must strengthen and expand Social Security for those who worked hard all their lives, or those with a severe disability.
Hartford is a city on the move! I applaud @TheHartford for making this generous investment in our children.
Millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions could face discrimination from insurance companies if the GOP’s lawsuit succeeds. The new Democratic House will protect health care for all Americans. #ProtectOurCare
My deepest sympathies go out to those who have lost loved ones in the CA wildfires. My support and prayers are also with the brave men and women battling these terrible fires.
Today, we pause and reflect on the service and courage of our veterans and their families who sacrificed so much to protect our freedoms and values here at home. We are the land of the free because of the brave. Thank you veterans.
