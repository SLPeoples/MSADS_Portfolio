In case you missed it, I was happy to join @Varneyco on @FoxBusiness this morning.
I was thrilled to be at the VA Tennessee Valley Clinic in Gallatin Friday for the ribbon cutting. Our veterans in #TN6 truly deserve the best of care.

My boy is giving me a hand this evening. Keeping family close is important. #TN6
“Every day the Democrats delay construction of the wall is another day American lives are at risk.”Read my full statement on voting to support the President in fully funding the wall here:
Enjoyed hearing today from Larry Kudlow, Director of the National Economic Council under @POTUS. President Trump's policies are lifting all boats with GDP growth above 3%, more job openings than unemployed, and real wage growth for American workers.
As flood waters bring devastating damage to our #TN6 communities, take extra precaution at home and while driving to be safe. More rain is expected throughout the day.

From George Washington to now, I am thankful for the many devoted Americans who chose country over self in serving as commander in chief. Especially grateful today for the work @POTUS has done to #BuildTheWall, #StandForLife, and #SupportOurTroops
ICYMI: Rose Votes “NO” on Bloated Spending
Anti-Semitic rhetoric is dangerous, offensive, and un-American. As the President stated today, this rhetoric is completely unacceptable from a Member of Congress. #TN6 will always stand with Israel and the Jewish community.
Congratulations to Smith Farmers Co-op for a successful year in 2018. Great to see so many of my fellow members at this weekend’s Annual Meeting and, as always, proud to farm in this community. #TN6

Thank you @POTUS for leading the fight to #BuildTheWall, #StandForLIfe, and empower #JobCreation. Our #StateoftheUnion is strong and I will continue to work every day for prosperity in our country and #TN06. #SOTU
With 304,000 jobs created last month alone, we know @POTUS is placing hard working Americans first. I will stand with @POTUS to continue job creation, tax reform, and policies that promote economic prosperity for #TN06 and our country! #Jobs #SOTU
President Trump is committed to solving the infrastructure crisis, which is crippling communities across the country. I will stand with @POTUS as a strong advocate for #TN06 for roads and other infrastructure. #SOTU
Tonight, the Corcoran family, from East TN, is here at the #SOTU. Our hearts are with them as we remember their son, Pierce, whose life was tragically taken by an illegal immigrant. We must stand with @POTUS to end these senseless tragedies.  #AngelFamilies #BorderSecurity
As long as we do not have a wall on our southern border, every state is a border state. It is far past time to end the flow of illegal drugs and criminals into our country. I stand with @POTUS and will work with him to #BuildTheWall #SOTU
In recent days, we have tragically witnessed other states terminating protections for the unborn but in #TN06 we believe every life matters. Thank you @POTUS for standing strong for life! #TennesseeValues #SOTU
Issues I expect @POTUS to hit hard in the #SOTU tonight:

Two years ago @realdonaldtrump was inaugurated as @POTUS. What a great two years it has been! I'll continue to work with him to put America first.
Thank you @POTUS and @VP for standing strong for religious freedom. The good people of #TN06 stand with you and the people of faith across this nation stand with you. #ReligiousFreedomDay #TennesseeValues
