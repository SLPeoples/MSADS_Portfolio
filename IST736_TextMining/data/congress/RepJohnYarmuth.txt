Today, I was proud to vote for H.R. 1, the #ForThePeople Act, to restore fairness in our elections, expand access to the polls, and reduce the role of money in politics.Sen. Mitch McConnell called this legislation a “power grab.” He’s right. We’re returning power to the PEOPLE.

Photos of VA Gov. Ralph Northam in 1984 conjure up a racist and hate-filled past of our nation that should be left on the ash heap of history, not celebrated by our leaders. He must resign immediately.

And if there was any question, I am a passionate supporter of the 1st Amendment. I will always defend the right to wear MAGA hats. Just not the un-American policies they represent.
The President’s fans seem far more upset by my (obvious) joke about banning hats than they were when the President said literally the same thing about banning actual human beings. Go figure.
The conduct we saw in this video is beyond appalling, but it didn’t happen in a vacuum. This is a direct result of the racist hatred displayed daily by the President of the United States who, sadly, some mistake for a role model. [2/2]
I am calling for a total and complete shutdown of teenagers wearing MAGA hats until we can figure out what is going on. They seem to be poisoning young minds. [1/2]

For millions of people around the globe, our airport is their first impression of Louisville, and I can think of no better way to introduce travelers to our community than Muhammad Ali and the values he embodied and fought for his entire life.

As Federal officials continue to work with local and state law enforcement in the wake of this week’s senseless Kroger murders, I believe they can and should take into account the racist words and actions of the man behind this gruesome act and call it what it was: a hate crime.
Hate should have no home in America. Nine years ago this week, the Matthew Shepard James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act was signed into law, legislation I cosponsored to remove barriers to pursuing prosecution of hate crimes based on race and other factors.

In what universe, when you say you believe a woman when she says she was assaulted, but you don’t think she remembers who assaulted her, does it mean you actually believe the woman? Apparently in the Republican Senate universe. I still believe Dr. Ford.

They gave a deeply unpopular and blatantly dishonest partisan a lifetime appointment to the highest court in the land, under a cloud of credible allegations, for the most political and ideological of reasons. [2/3]
