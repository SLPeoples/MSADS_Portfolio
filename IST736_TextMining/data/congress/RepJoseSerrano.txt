Every single Member of Congress swore an oath to defend our Constitution. @HouseGOP @SenateGOP need to join Democrats and defend our Constitution from @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeTrumpEmergency.
"With his declaration of a national emergency at the southern border, President Trump takes executive overreach to dizzying new heights. " I couldn't agree more. #FakeTrumpEmergency

As I see it, going around Congress to build this wall is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.  I’m sure the courts will agree.
The President previously signed funding bills that didn't include funding for his wall and funded other priorities. Money cannot and should not be reallocated without the express approval of Congress and the Appropriations Committee.
The Constitution is very clear. Congress has the power of the purse, not the President. This #FAKENationalEmergency is going around Congress the @AppropsDems @SenateApprops to waste money building an unnecessary wall along the southern border.
The reality of the #FakeTrumpEmergency? It makes America less safe by stealing billions from crucial military construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness quality of life necessary to do their jobs effectively.
I stand with @SpeakerPelosi @SenSchumer to defend ourConstitution. This “national emergency” scam violates our system of checks balances, and undermines our Founders’ vision for our country. QT:
The president's insistence on building a wall dragged us through the longest shutdown in history. Now he wants to declare a #NationalEmergency that will reallocate resources from other places to fund it, including from #PuertoRico's aid funds. This is absurd and disgusting.
Many of my constituents in #TheBronx have benefited from their services, and as Chairman of the @AppropsDems CJS subcommittee, funding this agency is one of my top priorities.
Great meeting w/ the @NYSBA to discuss funding for @LSCtweets. For many years, I have supported The Legal Services Corporation, which is instrumental in providing civil legal aid to low-income Americans.

As the top Democrat on @AppropsDems subcommittee funding the Census, I will continue to fight for a fair and accurate count. 
I support the federal court's decision to block @CommerceGov from including a citizenship question in the #2020Census. It would be unwarranted will undermine the accuracy of the only mechanism we have to obtain critical data every 10 years prevent fair allocation of resources
Over 3 million New Yorkers could lose access to nutrition assistance due to the #TrumpShutdown. I voted to reopen the government last week so no child will go hungry in #TheBronx across the nation. It’s time for the president and the Senate to act.
El cierre de gobierno ha pasado su tercer semana y es oficialmente el cierre de gobierno mas largo de la historia. Le pido a mis colegas Republicanos y al Presidente que terminen con este cierre de gobierno.
The #TrumpShutdown has now passed its third week and is officially the longest shut down in history. I urge my @GOP colleagues and the president to end this shutdown now. The House has done its part, we have passed bipartisan bills that can end this, lets get it done.
I wish I could say this is unbelievable, but this is sadly in keeping with Donald Trump’s disregard for #PuertoRico and for #Latinos. Stealing from the recovery effort to fund the wall is beyond reprehensible.  As an Appropriator, I’ll do everything in my power to stop it.
We invited the community to come in to discuss the issues regardless of their immigration status because everyone deserves to be heard. I opposed a wall then, and I oppose a wall now.  Construction of a border wall violates the moral values of our nation.
I said to myself, why don't I take these bricks do just the opposite, make them a tribute to all immigrants. I collected 273 bricks brought them back to #TheBronx. @ahtway @billaguado teamed up to create a beautiful art piece at @HostosCollege w/ the bricks.
13 years ago we had a similar debate over walls. As that debate raged, thousands of bricks with hateful rhetoric like "No to illegals" "Secure our border" were sent to myself other colleagues that opposed a border wall.
Did you really think we were going to hear something new from the White House? Same campaign speech pushing fear instead of  dealing with the truth. Lie after lie and telling us that México is paying for the wall. End the shutdown and let’s move on to immigration reform.

Let’s stop with the games and temper tantrums over an unnecessary border wall. #Trumpshutdown
Public Safety Will Be Undermined.  State and local law enforcement training programs will be stopped.  The Department of Justice’s civil litigation efforts against bad actors will halt.  Payments to crime victims will stop.
More than 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers will be forced to work without pay, including from the @FBI, @ATFHQ, @DEAHQ, as well as U.S. Marshals and Bureau of Prisons personnel.
88 percent of @CommerceGov employees will be furloughed without pay- approximately 41,00 individuals.  These include employees at economic development programs like @US_EDA and @USMBDA.  96 percent of @NASA employees will be furloughed.
As the top Democrat on the @AppropsDems Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice Science, I wanted to point out that the #TrumpShutdown would severely harm the agencies that under my oversight, including @NASA @CommerceGov @NWS @TheJusticeDept, @FBI others.
Shutting down the government for an unnecessary border wall is shameful and goes against the values of our country. #TrumpShutdown

As the author of the Baseball Diplomacy Act, first introduced in 1995, I’m thrilled to hear the @MLB @CubanaBeisbol have reached an agreement to allow Cuban baseball players to play in the U.S. without having to defect.
Unbelievable that he is willing to put the livelihood of thousands of Americans on the line for the sake of an unnecessary border wall that won’t fix our broken immigration system.
Failure to include funding for the border wall is the only thing keeping the President from approving signing the bipartisan CR legislation that the Senate passed, which the House is more than ready to pass. Wasn’t #Mexico supposed to pay for the wall?
The president's stubbornness will cause a #TrumpShutdown in the middle of the Holiday season that will cost taxpayers billions of dollars leave over 420,000 Federal employees working w/o pay and another 400,000 furloughed.
“Helping” the most vulnerable on the island by taking away their benefits and protections is a cruel and ineffective policy choice: 
Those policies will ultimately only make the situation worse for thousands of #Americans living on the island already suffering the consequences of the ongoing economic crisis.
It appears to be nothing more than a flimsy justification to implement conservative economic policies and draconian austerity measures in #PuertoRico.
Disappointed by the @washingtonpost op-ed from #PuertoRico's Financial Oversight Board Members blaming progressive working conditions safety net programs for the lack of economic activity and labor participation in Puerto Rico.
.@DHSgov must reevaluate its detention practices investigate those involved in this horrific tragedy

What happened over the weekend in the #SanYsidro Port of Entry is unprecedented horrifying for the U.S. Pictures of children crying running away from tear gas were devastating. Those crossing the border are fleeing extreme violence poverty, situations out of their control.

I support delaying a vote on Brett Kavanaugh until all these serious allegations are thoroughly investigated. There is no reason to rush a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court and prevent Senators from having the information they need. #DelaytheVote
Hispanics have been here for 500 years and made significant contributions in every area throughout U.S. history. While some progress has been made, a @latinomuseum solely dedicated to Latino history, art and culture is long overdue: #HHM
