Thank you @GavinNewsom for visiting our border community. @realDonaldTrump’s fake national emergency is nothing more than an attempt to undermine the will of Congress and the American people.
Israel has and remains a stalwart ally of the United States because of our countries’ shared interests and values. I condemn her remarks and believe she should apologize for her offensive comments. (2/2)
It is disturbing that Rep. Omar continues to perpetuate hurtful anti-Semitic stereotypes that misrepresent our Jewish community. Additionally, questioning support for the U.S.-Israel relationship is unacceptable. (1/2)

Thank you @LeaderHoyer for coming to #CA51 and touring our border region to learn how the Trump Administration's problematic policies are hurting our communities and adding unnecessary barriers to the asylum process.
.@LeaderHoyer, @RepScottPeters, @RepMikeLevin, I are at the San Ysidro Port of Entry being briefed by @CBP on how they are implementing the new #MPP policy.
Making asylum seekers stay in a country that is foreign to them contradicts the founding principles of our nation. As a world leader, the U.S. should be modeling how to treat the world’s most vulnerable populations.

Since taking office, President Trump has selfishly put his interests ahead of those of the American people. The executive power of declaring a national emergency should be reserved for instances of disaster – not some manufactured crisis he created himself.
The current systems in place are failing people are dying. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity have access to medical care. Congress demands answers.
An attack on our LGBTQ community is attack on all of us. I condemn all acts of hate and will continue to work to make our country safer and more inclusive. (2/2)

Paid family leave is far too rare. Today, we honor hardworking families by introducing the #FAMILYAct to create a gender neutral paid family medical leave program. Thank you @rosadelauro @SenGillibrand for leading Congress on this effort.
Happy to take a step towards gender equity today by cosponsoring the #FAMILYAct to give workers *paid* family medical leave.
In 1993, the Family and Medical Leave Act transformed lives across our nation. 26 years later, millions of workers are still forced to choose between putting food on the table or taking care of a loved one. We need the #FAMILYAct now.

It is shameful that the Trump Administration has failed to reunite separated children with their parents. This administration must abide by the court's order and reunite these families as quickly as possible!
Sadly, no progress was made during our meeting with DHS Secretary Kristjen Nielsen. Her responses were vague and uninformed. This administration continues to believe in a different reality rather than face the consequences of their policies.

We must understand how virtual currencies are used to facilitate drug sex trafficking. I'm glad to see that my bill passed in the House with strong bipartisan support I hope to see the same level of support for this legislation in the Senate. Release:
