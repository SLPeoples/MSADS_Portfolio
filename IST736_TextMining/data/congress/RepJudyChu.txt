High fives for #InternationalWomensDay
I'm proud to have voted for #HR1 to restore faith in our democratic process. This bill gives power back to the people by shining a light on dark money in politics and ensuring that every eligible voter has the chance to use their voice. #ForThePeople
Even Nina Olson, the National Taxpayer Advocate, told us today that she is uncertain if she withheld the right amount on her taxes. She told us Congress needs to protect taxpayers. That's exactly what my bill - H.R. 1300 - will do. We need to act immediately to protect taxpayers

Jin Park was brought here from S. Korea at the age of 7. Years later, he became the first DACA recipient to win the Rhodes Scholarship - an achievement he is afraid to pursue b/c he fears being denied reentry to the US. We need a #DREAMActNow for courageous Americans like Jin
Thank you @ZoeLofgren and @RepJerryNadler for today's @HouseJudiciary hearing on the need to protect #Dreamers and #TPS recipients. We value our immigrants who are regularly working hard and contributing to our communities. You can watch live here:
Hi @realDonaldTrump. This week, the @WaysMeansCmte committee will have hearings on infrastructure and drug prices. I'll be at both, discussing infrastructure projects in my district looking at the amount of money drug makers actually spend on I invite you to watch.
It’s one thing to have star power. It’s another thing to use that power to encourage people to learn about the issues and get involved in politics. Thank you @ChrisEvans for being a real hero and encouraging informed civic engagement.
Over her career, the typical AAPI woman loses at least $292,400 to the wage gap; in some states, the situation is much worse. We need to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act to ensure #AAPIEqualPay #NotYourModelMinority
It's clear the #GOPTaxScam is not working for many Americans, like those in my district who are paying MORE in taxes thanks to the cap on  SALT. We need tax reform that helps the middle class, which is why I'm a proud original cosponsor of @BillPascrell's bill to repeal SALT cap

Trump's national emergency declaration is undemocratic, unwarranted, and built on bigoted mistruths that immigrants are a threat. The American people and Congress have rejected his demand for a wall, and I am proud that we voted bipartisanly to oppose this abuse of power.
As AAPIs, we know disenfranchisement. That’s why I’m standing w/ leaders like @repjohnlewis to introduce the Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect our right to vote, stop states from disenfranchising vulnerable communities, and ensure that our voices will always be heard.

Ahead of your summit with Kim Jong-un, @realDonaldTrump, I am once again sharing my letter requesting that you make family reunions an immediate priority. It's been over six decades since war divided these families and time is running out for 100k Americans w/ relatives in DPRK
Trump is claiming to protect lives, but this new rule will endanger women by undermining organizations like @PPFA, which is often the only source of healthcare for millions of Americans, many low income. Threatening people’s healthcare is unconscionable

Japanese imprisonment during WWII was so unconscionable and un-American that Congress later apologized and provided reparations for it. Nearly 80 yrs later, we must continue to remain vigilant in speaking out against injustice wherever it occurs
Today, I took action to help taxpayers who are facing a withholding penalty from the IRS. I introduced the Taxpayer Penalty Protection Act to shield families from paying the price for a hastily written #GOPTaxScam
Homeland security experts explicitly disagree with you and Trump about the need for a wall or the existence of a crisis at the border. In fact, Trump today dismissed those same experts who say drugs come in through legal ports of entry. We're happy to listen. Are you?
Trump, last week, "We love legal immigrants.” Today: Trump resumes his chain migration slur, attacking immigrant families and saying he doesn't want them here.When somebody shows you who they are, believe them.
"I didn't need to do this" - says the President, immediately and publicly undercutting the entire rationale for this bigoted border wall.
This Valentine's Day,  @RepJohnKatko and I are introducing a bill to open up some room in our hearts for our most vulnerable animal friends. Our bill - the HEART Act - will make it easier to care for and rehabilitate dogs saved from dog fighting rings.
Not getting everything you want does not constitute an emergency. This will be challenged in court. The rule of law must matter more than the rule of Trump's hurt feelings.
Tax filing is difficult enough already without also making #LGBTQ families feel prejudiced against, That's why @RepAndyLevin I introduced this common sense fix that acknowledges LGBTQ couples as equals. #LoveIsLove

It's Congress's job to declare war, yet w/out any authorization, US support for the Saudi-led war in #Yemen has created an humanitarian crisis, with millions at risk of hunger, violence, and disease. Today, I voted for HJ Res 37 to reassert our authority and pull US support

Now if only we could find somebody to simulate working as president, we'd be all set.
I'm still waiting on Republican leaders to apologize for: - Calling all Muslims terrorists- Smearing immigrants as criminals- Banning trans members of the military- "Good people on both sides" - Accusing Jewish donors of buying elections- Insults to Native more
As tax filing season gets underway, millions have been shocked to find they owe the IRS or will receive a much smaller than expected refund. Today, @repjohnlewis I asked IRS and Treasury for answers and more penalty relief for taxpayers.
I taught for thirty years. To my fellow teachers out there - I know how hard you work for long hours and low pay to prepare lesson plans, understand your students' needs, and create unique projects often at your own expense. You are seen and you are appreciated.

#Paidleave means the freedom to start a family if, when and how you choose. And it should be available to all women and working people, no matter where you live or work. #FAMILYAct
Why is Trump tweeting about a single power plant? Because it buys from a Trump donor in West Virginia who also happened to employ now acting EPA head Andrew Wheeler. He's hurting our health and planet to enrich his friends. Time to drain the swamp so we can clean our air!
We have a border crossing problem, but not the one you think: Americans are going to Mexico for affordable meds. I pressed experts on how direct-to-consumer advertising drives up drug prices even as drug makers profit from the #GOPTaxScam
Is the #GOPTaxScam leaving you with less money from a smaller refund? Maybe you even owe the government. I want to hear how the #TaxScam has left you paying the tab for the GOP's handouts to corporations and their shareholders.
As we approach the deadline to avoid another gov't shutdown, a reminder: border crossings are the lowest in years there is no crisis. We are in this position because Republicans are falsely insisting that immigrants are dangerous. They're not. The wall is a distraction.
In his #SOTU, President Trump announced a new round of talks with North Korea. Today, I sent him a letter urging him to make it a priority to reunite Americans with their family members in North Korea. Time is running out for many of these families to see loved ones after 60+ yrs
Law Tax Professor George Yin: IRS code is clear - the Treasury Secretary must disclose a president’s tax returns when requested by the @WaysMeansCmte chairman. It was written to match the president’s unlimited power to examine and disclose a citizen’s tax returns.
We’ve just started our hearing to learn about the 40 year tradition of Presidents releasing their tax returns and why ensuring good government also requires transparency from our leaders to ensure they’re following the law and working in our interest.
Today, @SenJeffMerkley and I introduced our bills to close the loophole Trump has used to run immigrant child prison camps in Tornillo and Homestead, FL. I have seen the despair in the faces of these children. This policy is cruel and dangerous and must be ended.

I support this goal wholeheartedly, but first, Trump Pence will have to backtrack on their past policies. We need better sex education and access to prevention to achieve this goal. That also means continuing to support @PPFA and the ACA.

My full statement;
This is a huge win! Last year, knowing the #GOPTaxScam was rushed, the Trump admin gave relief to corporations by waiving a penalty. Starting last summer, I pressured them to do something similar for individuals. It took actually introducing a bill, but I'm glad they responded!

Before we leave, we'll vote on bills to fund Interior, EPA, and other agencies unrelated to Trump's demand for a border wall. 800,000 workers are supposed to be paid today. We cannot make them suffer over an unrelated border wall that won't even solve the problem Trump made up.
I look at the Democratic Party – with historic levels of diversity – and I see America.
Here's a compromise: Since Trump is so focused on medieval solutions, why not settle on a moat and spend the $5.7 billion to restore and revitalize the Rio Grande?

Nothing he said was in any way an urgent crisis that would require shutting down the government now for a wall that will be built later. #TrumpFactCheck #TrumpShutdown
Democrats do support border security. We have offered billions in border security. The wall is not border security. #TrumpFactCheck
Here’s one before he even starts: His own State Dep't found “no credible evidence indicating that international terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked with Mexican drug cartels or sent operatives via Mexico into the US” #FactCheckTrump
The only justifications for the #TrumpShutdown are either political or untrue. In tonight's #PrimeTimeTrump speech, expect to hear both. This shutdown is serious, and so I'll be fact checking the President live tonight. Follow along with #FactCheckTrump
This "unfortunate misstatement" was also made by @GOPLeader @SteveScalise both on the floor of the House and in front of the White House. It's not a mistake, it's a deliberate attempt to create a false crisis.
Loans from @SBAgov like 7(a) and the 504 program help small businesses expand, invest, hire more staff. But, thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, hundreds of millions of dollars cannot be accessed by the entrepreneurs who drive our economy. This stunt must end immediately!
We're ready to get our government back to work. This week, the House will vote on individual appropriations, because things like food for hungry families, environmental regulations, parks, 800,000 salaries should not be held hostage to an unrelated fight about Trump's wall.
The #TrumpShutdown should end immediately. There is no emergency or national security crisis. His claims to justify a wall are simply not true.
Once again, the Trump administration is unwilling or unable to make an honest case for their border wall. This government shutdown is a needless stunt and should end immediately.

I’m still waiting for an answer from @DHSgov with any evidence in support of this remarkable claim used by Trump co. to justify their demands for a wall. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth being honest about.
Thousands at that child prison camp in Tornillo are spending Christmas without their families this year because of Trump’s choice to circumvent a court order to release them within 20 days. We cannot forget them. We must shut this camp down now!
Away from water or electricity, in the middle of the desert, Trump is using loopholes to avoid a court order to act "in the best interest" of children. It's a child prison camp and it's Trump's dirty little secret. Time to shut #Tornillo down.
Thousands of Americans may not receive their hard-earned paychecks right before Christmas because this president refuses to stop campaigning. My statement on Trump's demands for an ineffective and expensive government-built monument to bigotry:
Once again, the core claim Republicans make to justify the wall - 10 terrorists/day at the southern border - is absolute fiction. I even asked DHS to back the claim up. I have yet to receive a response. Good polices don't need to be sold with fallacies.
Just 1 way to describe this: Sneaky! Republicans are trying to use our tax code to circumvent the Supreme Court by redefining "person" and setting the framework to undermine a woman's constitutional right to choose. This is an attack on women's health.
The child prison camp at #Tornillo is a national tragedy. It must be shut down today. I'm proud that @SenJeffMerkley I have introduced legislation to do just that. Children should be with loved ones, not treated as inmates
RT @SenJeffMerkley: What I saw when I went to the military-style Tornillo child prison camp at the border was horrific. That’s why I’m intr…
Taxpayers shouldn't have to face IRS penalties next year just because the GOP rushed their tax law through the process. That's why I've introduced a bill to protect individuals and small business owners like you from these unfair fines. Read more here:

I visited the #Tornillo tent city where these children are being held was outraged at conditions. Our gov't should not be indefinitely imprisoning children.  They should be with loved ones. This move is a start at returning to a saner immigration policy
Despite the GOP-led effort to repeal the #ACA through the courts, you can STILL sign-up for affordable health insurance. Open Enrollment on coveredca dot com continues until January 15! Make sure you and your family are protected with the plan that works for you and #getcovered.

Just 5 days until a government shutdown, and @GOP continues to justify it by claiming "10 terrorists a day" are approaching our southern border. This is a grave claim and so today, I've asked @DHSgov to weight the veracity of these claims.
RT @ACLU_BRC: There is no humane way to detain children. Congress must demand transparency and accountability of border agencies. That’s wh…
1400 kids could be released immediately if the Trump Administration changed its fingerprinting policy. Sponsors are afraid to come forward for fear that their legal status will be investigated by #ICE. #Tornillo
I’m at #tornillo w ⁦⁦@BetoORourke⁩ ⁦@SenJeffMerkley⁩ ⁦@maziehirono⁩  ⁦@TinaSmithMN⁩. We must #shutdowntornillo — this is a child prison. Children, no matter where they’re from, should not be treated this way.
Just heard that a judge in Texas struck down the #ACA. He sided w Trump and other Republicans who refused to defend the law as red states worked to overturn protections for pre-existing conditions. We will not let this ideological decision stand.
Cruel and misleading statement from DHS to blame the victim. She didn’t die from cartels, smugglers, or the elements. She died in US custody. We need an investigation to understand just what those “best efforts” were and if any of them included offering her water.
RT @SenJeffMerkley: That’s why @maziehirono @SenTinaSmith @RepJudyChu and I are here to investigate and shine a light on the unacceptable t…
We have been warning that the choice to treat immigrants as criminals was dangerous and traumatizing. This is just the latest evidence. Today and tomorrow, I'm at the border w/ @SenJeffMerkley @SenTinaSmith @RepBetoORourke to learn more. 
Let's talk about how many poor people of color are in jail right now for crimes where nobody got killed or robbed. @GOP, what crimes are okay to ignore?
Elected officials who sexually harass or discriminate against their staff should not be able to pass the penalty onto taxpayers. Today, we passed a bill to hold them accountable. This is just the beginning, but with more women in Congress than ever, I'm hopeful.
When it comes to environmental policy in the Trump Administration, it is no exaggeration to say that the rules are written by the
Today, I voted for a #FarmBill that helps farmers bring food to every American's table - even the poorest. There was a proposal that would have made it harder for people between jobs to avoid letting their families go hungry. I'm glad that conservative proposal was defeated.
These immigrants have been here for 30+ years, meaning this isn't about the economy or security concerns*. This is a hateful action against a minority community simply because they were born somewhere else.*Fact: Refugees grow the economy commit fewer crimes.
The American people deserve to have a say in whether we continue to support the Saudi-led war in Yemen, which is creating an humanitarian disaster. But today, @HouseGOP is holding a vote to block this Congress from even debating the War Powers Act!
I’m proud to stand with the people of Iran who are courageously striving for a free and democratic future.
Makes sense. His whole business was based on putting his name on things that shutdown.
According to US Customs and Border Protection, the majority of drugs are carried through legal ports of entry. A wall would not stop drug flow into the country and the President shouldn't hurt families our economy w/ a shutdown because of false information about border security
The Clean Water Act protects streams that feed drinking water sources for tens of millions. But today, Trump is announcing a #DirtyWaterRule that ignores science and public support in order to enrich polluters.
