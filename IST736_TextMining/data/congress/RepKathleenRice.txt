@ViscardiCenter Proud to do it! Thank you for all that your organization does for our community. I Look forward to continuing our work together!
I'm particularly proud to see one of my own amendments pass as part of this bill, which would ban Members of Congress and staff from serving on corporate boards. This was a long-overdue change that will finally close a massive ethics loophole in our laws. #HR1
The American people elected our new Democratic Majority to bring transparency accountability to Washington. Today, we delivered on that promise by passing the #ForThePeople Act, a bold democracy ethics reform package. #HR1
On #InternationalWomensDay I'm grateful for all the strong women who came before me excited to see the next generation keeping up the fight and breaking down new barriers.And this year I'm especially proud to be serving alongside this historic class of women in Congress!

Great turnout and lively discussion at our #TownHall in RVC!Thanks to everyone who came out tonight!
This is disgraceful and sad. Our President is defending a brutal dictator whose regime imprisoned, tortured and killed an American citizen.First Putin, then MBS, and now Kim Jung Un. Someone needs to inform the President that kowtowing is not the same as diplomacy.
TONIGHT: We're hosting a #TownHall at 7:00 PM tonight at South Side High School. Hope to see you there!
Today, Congress took real, bipartisan action to #EndGunViolence. I'm proud to have voted for #HR8, which will enact universal background checks.This bill will save lives and make our communities safer.
Less than 24 hours ago Gaetz issued a threat against the witness. He shouldn't be allowed to ask questions. He shouldn't even be allowed in the room.
This is awful and tragic. Praying for the victims and their families tonight.Awaiting more information as this develops.
The House just passed a bipartisan resolution to uphold the separation of powers in our country and end Trump's #FakeEmergency.The Senate must pass this bill and send a clear message that Congress won't allow the President to subvert the Constitution.
Today we're voting on @JoaquinCastrotx's resolution to stop Trump’s #FakeEmergency. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in both chambers to support this bill. This isn't a partisan issue, it's a constitutional one. We need to defend our coequal branch of government.
This statement is total nonsense. Not a single legitimate argument against either bill. Just more #NRA pandering. Pathetic and dangerous, but not at all surprising for an administration that's been bought by nearly every special interest in town.
I'm proud to support legislation to fully fund the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund make it permanent. We can never turn our backs on the brave first responders who answered the call that day and in the days after.I urge all my colleagues to support this bill. #Renew911VCF
Election interference isn't going away. We need to understand what @DHSgov is doing ahead of 2020 to counter this urgent and evolving threat.  These are critical questions that deserve answers.

This is shameful. The Trump Administration is attacking a public health program that’s been keeping people healthy for 50 years. Every American has a right to comprehensive family planning care and I will fight to #SaveTitleX for the millions of people who rely on it.
Too bad it was "simply a mistake" to have an inclusive motto that properly honors the brave women who have served and sacrificed. VA is wrong here, this motto should be changed. I plan on reintroducing my bipartisan bill to do just that.

This is absolutely unacceptable. We cannot and will not let this happen. We need to protect and fully fund this program. Every Member of Congress must join together to stand up for our 9/11 first responders, victims and their families.
This is the real national emergency. We cannot become numb or desensitized to these tragedies. Praying for the victims and families in Aurora.

This week marks the second in a row that Senate Republicans refused to consider bipartisan House bills to reopen the government. Their partisan inaction is hurting our veterans, their families and hundreds of thousands of federal workers who won't receive their paycheck today.
The National Archives Records Administration is closed due to the shutdown. My caseworkers use NARA every day to get records for veterans filing a claim w/ VA. These claims are time-sensitive. Each day that this shutdown continues is another day that those vets go without care.
This funding helped bring #NY04 back after Sandy, and it's critical to Puerto Rico's ongoing recovery. It saves lives and protects communities from future storms. Wasting it on a useless wall is downright dumb and reckless.Not going to happen.

This week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers won’t receive a paycheck. That includes TSA, CBP, FBI DEA agents, and members of the Coast Guard - the very people who are charged with protecting our homeland. To all of them, thank you for continuing to protect and serve.
There's been no accountability for the administration's reckless border policy. And the consequences have been tragic. This glaring neglect cannot continue. There needs to be greater oversight a thorough investigation. In the next Congress we'll do both.

This #shutdown is brought to you by @POTUS @HouseGOP. Instead of passing the Senate's funding bill, they decided to hold this country hostage. They voted on a pointless messaging bill to fund a useless border wall – a bill that they knew would go nowhere.

Today, @RepBrianMast I introduced a bipartisan bill that would change the VA's motto to make it more inclusive of women veterans.The brave women who have worn our nation's uniform deserve to be equally embraced by the agency meant to support them.

As we marked 100 years since the end of WWI, I laid a wreath at the gravesite of New York native Nurse Alice Hagadorn in Suresnes, France. She served bravely on the front lines during the war. Thank you to Nurse Hagadorn and to all of our veterans for their service sacrifice.
Today we honor the men and women who have served and sacrificed for our country, and we renew our commitment to supporting all veterans and their families – every day. #VeteransDay

We're holding Mobile Office Hours on Tuesday, November 20 at the Freeport Recreation Center in #NY04! Come by for help getting covered during #OpenEnrollment or for any other constituent services.Hope to see you there!
Completely agree. This is critical to maintaining the integrity and independence of the DOJ.
Disgusting and unacceptable. These expressions of hate have absolutely no place in our community or in our country. Period. We all must speak out and stand up against anti-Semitism where ever we see it.
Except your administration is supporting a lawsuit by 20 Republican Attorneys General that would dismantle those protections. Either you don't have a clue about what your own administration is doing, or you're lying. Not sure which I believe more.
We learned a lot of hard lessons after Sandy. This is an important, bipartisan bill that will make the storm recovery process fairer, more transparent and less burdensome for future storm survivors.
Today I introduced the Transparent Disaster Relief Act, which requires FEMA to give storm survivors more information on duplicative benefits so that they aren't later saddled with unfair claw-backs. This is an important step toward reforming the process.

Devastated and horrified by the events in Pittsburgh. Our hearts go out to the victims and their families and to the entire Tree of Life community. We must stand firm against anti-semitism and we must take meaningful action to prevent gun violence. Enough is enough.

Had a great time visiting Rambam Mesivta and Shulamith this morning! Two wonderful schools in #NY04. Keep up the great work!
Today we welcomed a new Mobile Medical Unit for veterans in @NorthHempstead. A critical resource for our local vets. Thank you to all those who helped make this possible.
For weeks Saudi Arabia has misled the world about Jamal Khashoggi's death. There’s absolutely no way we can trust this regime to conduct a credible investigation.The U.S. must stand up for its values unequivocally stand firm against governments that target the press.
