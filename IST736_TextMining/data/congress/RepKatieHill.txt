A lot of love for the #KatieCaucus – not only do we get to work together to deliver results for #CA25 and #CA45, but our offices are actually right down the hall from each other!And we have to have our intern team log any calls we get that are meant for "the other Katie!" �
Happy #InternationalWomensDay from your favorite Congressional roomies. Ft. @RepUnderwood’s famous green coat (cc: @LaurenCoat)! ��
On #InternationalWomensDay, I want to shout out all of the fearless, fun, and fabulous women on my team who are fighting alongside me every single day — these ladies are some of the hardest workers I’ve ever met and without them none of this would be possible. ��
Catch me on @CNNSitRoom with @wolfblitzer in just a few. Tune into @CNN now!Thanks for having me, Wolf!
I am here in the halls of Congress on #InternationalWomensDay — we have more women serving in Congress than ever before, but we stand on the shoulders of the women who paved the way. I am so proud to be here and so proud to continue the fight for equal representation. �

@BluewaternavyW Hi there! I'm proud to be a cosponsor on @RepMarkTakano's bipartisan Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 (H.R. 299) and thank you for following up on this critical issue.
The VA estimates that every day, 20 veterans die by suicide. Some veterans have committed suicide at the very VA hospitals where they went to receive care. My line of questions for the #GAO in today's @OversightDems' hearing shines a light on this crisis.
Thankful to my colleague on @GOPoversight, @RepCarolMiller, for her question on the Veteran's Health Administration and the #VA covering up its extensive wait times. All veterans should have access to the care that they have earned and deserve.
After the most deadly fire season in CA's history, we know there is no way to fully address our nation's safety and security without also ensuring our federal government is addressing our climate crisis. @AOC just asked about #ClimateChange's impact on our national security.
The #GAO is the Government Accountability Office -- bringing transparency and accountability to government is one of the main reasons I ran -- and it's one of the reasons I am on @OversightDems, now.
We're talking about the #VA, specifically the #GAO report that the VA has "leadership instability" as well as "inadequate oversight and accountability" -- our veterans in #CA25 deserve a VA worthy of their service. Thank you to @RepRobinKelly for your questions on this issue.
I am currently holding the gavel at today's @OversightDems hearing on the #GAO report on programs that are at risk for waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement.TUNE IN
Deeply thankful to @SenMcSallyAZ for her bravery in sharing her story — absolutely no one should fear reporting because of a broken system and I’m proud of my colleagues in the Senate for their work on addressing sexual assault in the military.

Drug companies have been jacking up prices on insulin for years -- it's a prime example of how our system is broken. We will continue to provide oversight on this issue and work to make sure that everyone has access to the medication they need to live.
A few weeks after our @OversightDems hearing on skyrocketing prescription drug prices, I'm glad that Eli Lilly is taking steps to make insulin more affordable, but as a member of the Diabetes Caucus, I know that this cut isn't enough for many Americans.

Q: What do we do about housing affordability?A: When people can’t buy houses, it puts pressure on the rental market — especially for my generation. On the fed level, we need to incentivize buying homes and make sure tax credits support middle class families and not big corps.

I'd like to pause this rambling press conference declaring a #FAKENationalEmergency to congratulate the #NotoriousRBG on being back in action.Glad to have you back, Justice Ginsburg! Seriously.
It’s absolutely absurd to cut funding from real emergencies — like cleanup and future forest fire mitigation after the most deadly fire season in California’s history — to sidestep congressional approval.
The ability to declare a #NationalEmergency is given to the President to act when Congress doesn't have time to. Not when Congress acts and the President disagrees. This is why the American people don't have faith in their government — the political games have to stop.
