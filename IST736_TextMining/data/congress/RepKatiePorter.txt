.@CFPB was the first agency in our nation’s history whose sole purpose was to protect American consumers. @CFPBDirector should be an expert in consumer finance—my questioning showed she
@magnus1326 @katieporteroc @godlovesdjg Yes! I’m working on a bipartisan bill to allow working parents to keep more of the money they earn, pre-tax, and use it to pay for childcare.
Honored to be included among this bunch of fierce women.
Last year alone, $300M was spent just in CA funding ballot initiative campaigns. Today, my amendment passed with #HR1 to close a loophole that prohibited foreign spending on candidates–but not issue campaigns. Elections should be #ForThePeople, not foreign special interests.
I worked language into #HR1 that will allow working parents running for Congress to use campaign funds for childcare costs. I’m a single mom of 3 kids; I saw firsthand just how tall the barriers are that stop average Americans from running #ForThePeople.
Yesterday, I joined my colleagues in introducing legislation to reauthorize #VAWA, the Violence Against Women Act. I was honored to do so during #WomensHistoryMonth and as we celebrate #InternationalWomensDay today.
I’m pleased to have two provisions I wrote included in #HR1: one to ban foreign money from influencing our state and local ballot initiative processes and one to make it easier for working and middle class parents to run for office.
I could not be more proud to join my House colleagues to pass #HR1 today to get Washington working #ForThePeople. This historic legislation strengthens voting rights, restores ethics, and reduces the influence of dark money in politics.
Today, I introduced my first two bills in the House, and I wanted to give you an inside look at how a bill becomes a law, not just the Schoolhouse Rock version. WATCH &gt;&gt;
.@CFPBDirector Kraninger told @FSCDems today that she’s committed to promoting transparency. All she made transparent is that under her leadership, @CFPB policing is more Paul Blart than Olivia Benson.
RT @RealBankReform: �The DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU MEANT TO #PROTECTCONSUMERS cannot even BALLPARK the APR of a short-term payday loan. So *ho…
For too long, corporate special interests have drowned out the voices of working families in Washington. That changes now. I’m supporting #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, to shine a bright light on dark money, and I’m glad to have my colleagues alongside me.
I’m proud to stand with our hardworking federal employees of @NTEUnews, who help Americans across the the country access the government services they need—including tax refunds and consumer protection.
SOON: I’m participating in a @FSCDems hearing where I’ll be questioning @CFPB Director Kathy Kraninger about how the Trump Administration’s CFPB has failed to put #ConsumersFirst.  � WATCH &gt;&gt;
Orange County families elected me to fight for them, #ForThePeople, not sell out to big corporations. I helped to strengthen #HR1 because I believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant. We all deserve to know who’s really pulling the levers in Washington.
Great conversation with @ChrisEvans today about consumer protection, my work on @FSCDems the red dents in my house from my sons throwing around shields fighting Nazis. Thank you for having me for the important work you’re doing to get people informed about issues that matter.
Today on #AAPIEqualPay Day, we acknowledge the work to be done to achieve pay equity for AAPI women—on average they are paid 85¢ for every $1 paid to white male counterparts. Some AAPI ethnic subgroups make less than 60¢ per $1. We need #PaycheckFairness.
I condemn this display of a hateful, anti-semitic symbol and call on parents and community leaders to redouble our efforts to educate young people about the history of violence against Jewish people worldwide. This has no place in Orange County.
I was moved by my visit to the @HolocaustMuseum this week, where I saw an amazing exhibit that will soon begin traveling the country. Many thanks to @RepRaskin for organizing this trip. I will work with Orange County institutions to try to bring this exhibit to #CA45.
I couldn't agree more. Members of Congress should work #ForThePeople, not for corporate special interests. @RepAngieCraig's legislation has my full support.
March is #WomensHistoryMonth. I’m honored to be part of a historic class with a record number of Congresswomen thankful for the women who paved the way for us to serve.
I proposed my first amendment today, which would require a study on how firearm possession affects survivors of domestic violence give Congress the info we need to improve our background check process to protect survivors. It was adopted on a bipartisan basis. WATCH &gt;&gt;
Gun violence interacts in harmful ways with domestic violence. I ensured that that legislation we passed today to close the Charleston loophole would also give us data on what changes we might need to our background check process to protect domestic violence survivors.
I’ve decided to cosponsor the Medicare for All Act of 2019.Read my statement &gt;&gt;
Today, I voted to pass #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, and I wanted you to hear directly from me why:
What am I serving today?An orange lewk for gun safety and a couple consumer protection pies.
Thanks for giving me the last word last night, @Lawrence. When it comes to holding special interests accountable to the American people, I won’t back down.ICYMI, watch @TheLastWord on @MSNBC &gt;&gt;
The disclosure of sensitive, personally identifiable information is a harm. Just ask @Equifax CEO Mark Begor.
The legislation also includes designates over 1 million acres of wilderness—including 5 new recreation areas in California. As a Cub Scout Mom, I understand the need to preserve our nation’s rich natural landscapes for future generations to enjoy. This is a big win #ForThePeople.
I’m joining my House colleagues now to permanently extend the Land and Water Conservation Fund #LWCF, which takes royalties from offshore drilling to fund conservation of our #PublicLands. This commonsense program has already protected millions of acres of lands from mining.
NOW: I’m voting to end the President’s unnecessary emergency declaration. Watch me explain why ️️
Today, I brought the receipts.
I’m glad I had the chance to meet with Aidan and Dani, two student advocates at UCLA from #CA45, to talk about the issues that matter to them as young people. Thank you both for stopping by!
TODAY: I’m participating in a @FSCDems hearing to bring accountability to credit reporting agencies that have been playing fast and loose with consumers’ data for far too long. � Tune in here:
Happy to see my friend @GavinNewsom tonight for a bipartisan briefing on issues impacting California, especially wildfires. Whether Democrat or Republican, the CA delegation is fighting for our state in Washington.
It’s time to close the #CharlestonLoophole. That’s why I’m supporting a commonsense bill sponsored by @WhipClyburn that will extend the waiting period for firearm purchases to 10 days, to ensure that guns don’t end up in the wrong hands.
In 2016, the Charleston loophole meant that 4,170 guns were sold to people with criminal records, mental illnesses, or other circumstances which should have prevented them from being able to buy a gun—because FBI background checks weren’t completed in a three day window.
In 2015, the Charleston loophole in our gun safety laws allowed a self-proclaimed white supremacist to buy a gun that he then used to kill 9 black parishioners at a Bible study—despite a record of illegal drug possession that should have disqualified his purchase.
President Trump will be in Vietnam for a summit this week. I sent a bipartisan letter with 26 colleagues, including @BradSherman @RepTedYoho—the Chairman lead Republican on @HouseForeign Subcommittee on Asia—asking the President for his help in securing Michael’s release.
I was honored to have Helen join me in Washington for the State of the Union address earlier this month. Michael is a member of our Orange County community, and getting him home continues to be one of my top priorities.
During the District Work Period this week, I participated in a great workshop in Irvine with @MomsDemand and @Bradybuzz. I’m newly energized to get back to Washington today to work on gun safety, hopefully passing #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act.
Thank you to everyone that came to our welcome party this afternoon and saw our new space! Now, we get to work! Don’t forget to stop in to talk to our staff or ask for help.
Great turnout at our Irvine district office grand opening! This space belongs to you, the people of #CA45, and our office is committed to being open and accessible.
Excited to welcome everyone to your CA-45 District Office this afternoon from 2-4pm. Thanks to her Unicorn Brush, Betsy is ready to go party!
Our new Irvine district office belongs to you, the people of #CA45. Stop by tomorrow afternoon to see the office space and talk to my district staff about how we can best serve you.
Unintended pregnancies put a huge financial burden on women, particularly women in workplaces without family leave policies. A woman’s right to choose when/if she has a child is critical to economic justice. Attacks like these threaten progress we’ve made toward gender equity.
I’m backing @JoaquinCastrotx’s resolution to end the #FakeTrumpEmergency as a cosponsor. Declaring an emergency to circumvent Congress’s power of the purse tramples on our nation’s tradition of checks and balances. It’s unconstitutional.
Happy Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day! We’re fortunate to have the @UCIEngineering School right here in #CA45—and we should do all we can to break down the barriers for women and girls accessing and succeeding in world-class engineering programs like @UCIrvine’s.
Great conversation with @RepHarley, @RepGilCisneros, and community leaders about how we can deliver results for Orange County families. Let’s get to work, together.
Our Irvine office is just about open ready to serve #CA45 residents! There will be an office grand opening for everyone to see the space meet my district staff, who can arrange meetings with my office assist you with federal casework.RSVP:
Keeping our communities safe is at the heart of Orange County values. It’s past time for Congress to take action to prevent gun violence—let’s start by passing #HR8, the Bipartisan Universal Background Checks Act, and then continue to work together on gun safety.
Happy to see so many faces at my #CA45 Mission Viejo town hall! Our democracy works best when I can take your voices with me to Washington to fight for OC families like yours—and I promise to do just that.
NEWS: Our new #CA45 district office in Irvine will officially open next week! For those who are able to make it, I hope to see you there.RSVP online:
Glad to see @AGBecerra leading the way on behalf of CA in challenging @realdonaldtrump’s abuse of executive authority. The legislature controls the power of the purse: Article 1, Sec. 8 9. Maybe @RepPressley can loan her copy of the Constitution... #FakeTrumpEmergency
TOMORROW: I’m hosting a town hall in Mission Viejo. If you’re able to make it, I’d love to see you there.RSVP info ️️
.@usedgov should have held Argosy and Dream Center responsible for making empty promises to students. Instead, they were given free rein to make a quick buck at students’ and taxpayers’ expenses. If @BetsyDeVosED won't bring accountability to these con artists, I will.
It’s unacceptable that Argosy University and parent company Dream Center defrauded students in the 45th District and across the country. Some students are unable to pay rent or buy groceries, and $9 million of taxpayer-funded student aid has gone missing.
Western State law students in #CA45 still haven’t received the federal financial aid from their school that was expected in early January. I met with these students today to hear how I could best support them. This will be one of my top priorities until the situation is resolved.
@BetheeH There will be more to come!
I will cosponsor a bill to end this #FakeTrumpEmergency and continue to support efforts to restore checks and balances to our government.
The President cannot use an emergency declaration to advance a personal project that the majority of Congress and the American people don’t want to fund. This runs counter to our country’s commitment to the rule of law.
@LT92692 @VivAd73 Looking forward to seeing you there!
Have you signed up for my town hall in Mission Viejo this Tuesday? I can’t wait to see you there.
@raising_yogis @katieporteroc @USOCC @BankofAmerica Hi there. We’re in contact with BoA, trying to figure out what happened and when it will be universally fixed. Thanks for flagging this!
If you live in or are traveling through affected areas, please be careful and stay safe. Thanks to all who worked hard to get roads reopened.
As a single mom of three young kids, I know how hard work-life balance can be—and I’m committed to working on bills that make life easier for working families, whether it’s paid family leave or allowing more pre-tax income to go towards childcare.
FACT: 11 million families in America with children under age 18 are single parent households. Single parents need to have a seat at the table when we talk about how Washington can do better for working families.
I’m proud to be part of a historic class of women in Congress and one of the first working single moms in Congress.
Grateful for the opportunity from my constituents to serve grateful to my kids, childcare provider, staff, neighbors, and colleagues for making me one of the first single working moms to serve in Congress. Don't tell me that hard is the same as impossible. #MomsInTheHouse (3/3)

We saw the Tammys @SenDuckworth and @SenatorBaldwin celebrating #ValentinesDay together, so @RepKatieHill and I decided to get in on the fun. Happy Valentine’s Day from the Katies!
Read my statement on my vote to #KeepGovernmentOpen ️️
We wouldn’t refuse to treat cancer just because we don’t know how to prevent it. Tackling homelessness is the same: we need to get people in supportive housing, as well as keep people from ending up on the streets in the first place. WATCH me explain at a @FSCDems hearing &gt;&gt;
The real emergency in this country is the lack of presidential leadership.

Thank you for your service, Opportunity. �
Orange County has the second largest homeless population in the U.S. for cities and counties of its size. I participated in a @FSCDems hearing today to identify things we can do on the federal level to tackle this problem.
HAPPENING NOW: I'm questioning witnesses as part of this important @FSCDems hearing to #EndHomelessness. Tune in at the link below!
In just a few moments, I’ll be participating in my first hearing as a member of @FSCDems, examining the homelessness crisis and how Congress can take steps to ensure that homes are affordable for all working families. Tune in &gt;&gt;
A record 7 million Americans are behind on their car payments. Many families are still struggling to find good jobs with good wages, even in an economy with low unemployment. On the @FSCDems, I’ll work to give middle-class families a boost
I had a great meeting with @CaliforniaSBDC to talk about how we can support small business owners—providing them tools and resources to help entrepreneurs get started. Looking forward to working together!
Last week, I spoke on the House floor about the need to strengthen gun violence prevention efforts. No family should ever have to go through what Mary Leigh and Charlie Blek suffered—losing their son to gun violence. Hear the story of these brave #CA45 parents &gt;&gt;
Today on #WomenInScienceDay, I want to spotlight a #CA45 resident my @UCIrvine colleague @KKTreseder. Her research uses fungi as a lens to study climate change—a pressing issue for our country. We should break down the barriers for women to join Dr. Treseder in STEM careers.

I'm hosting my second congressional town hall, and every resident of #CA45 is invited. RSVP online here:
I agree with @GavinNewsom. I fought to join the Financial Services Committee so we could return money to families’ pockets - not give handouts to Too Big to Fail banks.
Great day at the @CIFSS Girls Wrestling Championship! I was particularly excited to cheer on our #CA45 winners from Mission Viejo HS, Tustin HS, Beckman HS, Foothill HS, Irvine HS, and El Toro HS.
I had a wonderful time at @tetfest celebrating the start of the new lunar year. Many thanks to @uvsa for the warm welcome. Happy New Year!
As a proud Cub Scout mom, I’m excited to wish a happy 109th birthday to the @boyscouts! #ScoutMeIn
Our veterans should never have to miss a medical appointment because they can’t find affordable child care. Today I voted to pass H.R. 840, the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act, to make sure they can attend their appointments and get the care they’ve earned. #ChildCare4Vets
As I go forward as a Congressmember, I will keep John’s commitment to improving the lives of everyday Americans as a guidepost for our work. (3/3)
Rep. @JohnDingell inspired generations of lawmakers to fight for healthcare and our environment. Today, millions of older Americans have quality, affordable healthcare because he championed Medicare. (2/3)
To my friend and mentor @RepDebDingell, I continue to send prayers upon learning that her husband passed away. (1/3)
Happening now!
In less than an hour, I’ll be taking to the House floor to talk about the need for gun violence prevention to make our communities safer. Tune in on @CSPAN or watch online here:
I’m standing with my colleagues today to #EndRxMonopolyPrices. When it comes to Medicare, we should stop handcuffing older Americans with higher prescription drug prices to protect the profits of Big Pharma.
The @CFPB’s decision to roll back rules for the payday lending industry is just the latest sign of the Trump Administration putting corporate profits ahead of protecting American families from abusive practices. #CultureOfCorruption
It’s no secret why the payday lobby spends lavishly at Trump properties. It pays off when Trump’s @CFPB sides with loan sharks over consumers.
.@MickMulvaney once said “If you’re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn’t talk to you. If you’re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.” I’m sure the payday lending lobby is happy they gave him so much money when he was in Congress.
Today, the Trump @CFPB tossed out a rule to protect consumers from scam loans from payday lenders. In some states, interest rates can be over 700%. #StopTheDebtTrap
This one of the reasons I’m supporting #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Check Act. We need to keep our kids safe, no matter where they are in the country.
Let’s get this straight - Wall Street banks got a $21 billion windfall from the #GOPTaxScam while many middle-class Orange County families will see their taxes go up this year? Outrageous!
Happy to see my friend @RichCordray and have the opportunity to talk about how @FSCDems can protect consumers from shady lenders and continue his work @CFPB!
The President just announced the next Summit w/ North Korea will be in Vietnam. I urge him to press for a speedy, fair, transparent resolution for Michael Nguyen--an American citizen held in Vietnam w/o charges for 7 months. We need to #BringMichaelHome.
I’m bringing my constituent Helen Nguyen to #SOTU. Her husband Michael—an American citizen—has been detained in Vietnam without charge for nearly 7 months. It’s time to #BringMichaelHome to his family in Orange County.
And for some trivia on why it’s suffragist, not suffragette, read more here:
Today I’m joining my @HouseDemWomen colleagues in wearing suffragist white to honor the women who paved the way for a more equal society.
Happy #YearOfThePig!
As a working mom of 3, I know how important these protections are. Everyone deserves job-protected medical leave - and I’ll be in Congress making sure we do better.
26 years after the #FMLA was passed, 200 million Americans have taken unpaid time off to recover from a serious illness or care for new babies or sick relatives. But millions still don’t qualify for leave or can’t afford it.
Rosa Parks was born #OnThisDay in 1913. When she said no on that Montgomery bus, she showed immense courage and challenged the system of racial discrimination. I’m proud to honor her legacy as part of #BlackHistoryMonth.
It took us some time to secure a location and sign a lease, but we are so excited to move into our new office space today! Stay tuned for information about our open house and how to visit us! #CA45 �
Wishing a big victory to SoCal’s new team! Go Rams! � #SuperBowlLIII
As we head into the Year of the Pig, I hope that all those celebrating will enjoy a festive Lunar New Year with family and friends. I wish everyone prosperity and good health in the year ahead.
I fought for my seat on @FSCDems to make sure what happened in 2008 never happens again. There will be aggressive oversight if Otting tries to undo the work we’ve done so far (much more left to do) to make homes affordable for ALL Americans.
Buying a home is the largest purchase most Americans will make in their lives. If we ever want to live in a country where equality is more than just a concept, it is critical that we enforce fair mortgage lending terms.
The same Joseph Otting who *before* he was appointed claimed he does not believe discrimination exists in America. Remember this?
Joseph Otting was appointed by @realDonaldTrump to head the @USOCC: the agency responsible for policing discriminatory lending practices. He just gave @citibank a free pass on discriminating against people of color.
4 in 10 moms are the sole or primary breadwinner for their families. As a single mom of 3 young kids, I know how important #EqualPay is for working women. I'm proud to join my House colleagues to introduce the #PaycheckFairness Act.
Congratulations to the students of Uni High on a well-deserved win! I can’t wait to cheer you on as you head to the #NSB2019 National Finals in April.
It’s been 10 years since the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law, but we still haven’t achieved pay equity. Today I joined my colleagues in supporting the #PaycheckFairness Act, because #EqualPay isn’t just crucial to building a stronger economy—it’s the right thing to do.
.@goOCTA also talked to us about its public transit efforts and investment in cycling--including $4.3 million set aside each year for bicycle projects. I'm excited to collaborate on these important projects as well.
Wonderful and productive meeting with @RepMikeLevin and @goOCTA to talk about how we can make transit better for Orange County families. I’m looking forward to partnering with them to work on reducing congestion and improving roads.
I’m excited to announce that I’ll be serving on the @FSCDems subcommittees responsible for consumer protection and investor protection. With these positions, I’ll be fighting to make sure our economy works to create prosperity and opportunity for all American families.
Great meeting with @ACCOC today to talk about how we can work together to tackle homelessness, infrastructure, and other issues facing Orange County residents. If an issue is important to #CA45 families, it’s important to me.
According to the nonpartisan @USCBO, the #TrumpShutdown cost us $3 billion in permanently lost economic activity. The facts are clear—the shutdown was bad for federal workers and bad for our economy. Now that the government is open, it has to stay open.
On #HolocaustMemorialDay, we hold in our hearts millions whose lives were taken and millions more who were displaced. We must commit ourselves, today and every day, to stand united in the fight against hatred and to build a future of equality and justice for all. #WeRemember
I’m fortunate to be surrounded by wonderful colleagues at @UCIrvine like @drhhardt. As I work to keep #CA45 families safe, I’ll be having conversations with Dr. Hardt and others to stay up-to-date on the important role NATO plays in our national
Read my statement on the end of the #TrumpShutdown:
RT @RepKatiePorter: At my town hall last night, community members told me they’re worried about how the shutdown is hurting their families.…
What a #TBT. Since I gave this speech, the #TrumpShutdown became the longest shutdown in our nation’s history, and I voted six more times to reopen the government. It’s now Day 34, and it’s past time to #EndTheShutdown.
I’m so happy that @UCILaw student Sam is able to join us for a fellowship in our congressional office. We were so happy to host him after the government shutdown stopped him from interning at the @FTC.
If Secretary Ross read my report about how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting #CA45 families, he would know that almost 2/3 of furloughed employees don’t have enough in savings to pay their living expenses for longer than 14 days. READ my report &gt;&gt;
At my town hall last night, community members told me they’re worried about how the shutdown is hurting their families. I listened, and today I'm back in Washington and cast my 10th vote to reopen the government. WATCH from @ABC7 &gt;&gt;
I fought for a seat on @FSCDems because one of my top priorities is protecting American families from financial tricks that trap consumers in a cycle of debt. If the CFPB won’t do its job, California will, and I’ll stand by them on the Committee.
Financial Services Committee new Member orientation! Excited to get started.
Today marks one month since the #TrumpShutdown left 800,000 federal workers without paychecks. I heard from #CA45 families hurt by the shutdown at my first official town hall tonight—and I’m going to take their voices with me to Washington as I fight to reopen the government.
The Supreme Court decided Roe #OnThisDay in 1973 and affirmed that women have a right to control their own bodies. Reproductive justice is essential to gender equality; ensuring that working women can have kids if and when they want is a human right—and an economic imperative.
Today I proudly volunteered at the @OC_FoodBank to give back on #MLK #DayOfService. In Congress, I’m committed to upholding the ideals of justice and equality that Dr. King stood for.
I have a message for every American hurt in any way by this shutdown. WATCH:
Thank you @SecondHarvestFB for helping OC families in need.
I was so excited to see the energy at today’s Orange County Women’s March! I’m ready to take this inspiration back to Washington to work for OC families!
I was on @CNN this morning talking about the need to end the shutdown and get our government back to work. We need effective and comprehensive border security solutions for the 21st century.
I’ll be at the Women’s March tomorrow in Santa Ana—excited to see everyone there!
My first congressional #CA45TownHall is next week, and I want to hear from you about the shutdown and the other issues that matter to you and your family. RSVP here &gt;&gt;
@AFGE1260 President Bobby Orozco is right. This shutdown has to end, and our TSA officers need their paychecks. I’ve voted for every bill in the House to reopen the government, and I continue to stand with the hardworking OC federal workers harmed by the #TrumpShutdown.
As a mom, I entrust public schoolteachers with my 3 kids. As a mom of 2 very active boys, I’m especially grateful for school nurses and understand the necessity of having nursing staff in every school. I stand with LA teachers in their fight to put students first. #UTLAStrikeDay4
I’m excited to announce my appointment to the House Financial Services Committee. From bringing accountability to the big banks to promoting affordable homeownership, I’m ready to work on some of the most important issues for the people of #CA45.
I just voted to invest $12.1 billion in recovery for Americans devastated by natural disasters. After the wildfires we’ve seen, Californians need to know that the federal government will stand with them if a disaster occurs—I’ll be in Congress fighting to make sure that happens.
I'm continuing to meet with bank representatives to advocate for #CA45 workers hurt by the shutdown. If you need late fees waived or repayment timelines extended, ask your lender. Here's a list of #ShutdownHelp offerings by CA credit unions:
Melinda has been working for a government agency for over 30 years. She’s debating taking out a loan and researching whether she can file for unemployment. She just paid the tuition for one of her kids at college, so she doesn’t have the means to go without a paycheck.
Aubrey’s family has filed paperwork to borrow against their 401(k). Borrowing against her 401(k) will come with large tax penalties, but she’s part of a single-income household living on a federal government wage. #ShutdownStories
Last week, I gave my first speech on the House floor and told the stories of #CA45 families that have been hurt by the #TrumpShutdown. It’s time the President stop playing politics with their lives and get these folks their paychecks. (thread)
Last week, I sent letters to several of the country’s largest financial institutions, asking them to help families affected by the #TrumpShutdown. Blameless federal workers should not bear the cost of the President’s refusal to fund the government. Read the letter &gt;&gt;
From FDA inspectors to TSA officers, federal employees working to keep us safe are struggling to pay their bills. It’s Day 25. It’s past time to #EndTheShutdown.

My heart is sick to hear of the loss of Noah Domingo—a bright freshman at @UCIrvine. As a mom, I can’t imagine the immense sadness his parents are feeling. I know the staff at UCI and @OCSheriff are working hard to provide answers support to loved ones in this difficult time.
I’m honored to be part of the largest and most diverse class of women in Congress—including my fellow freshmen moms @RepKimSchrier, @RepSpanberger, @RepSherrill, @RepRashida, @RepLoriTrahan, and @RepPressley—and ready to work with them to deliver results for OC families.
And thanks to photographer Jeff Brown!
I’m thrilled to join a historic class of freshmen that reflects and represents the diverse communities that make our district and our country strong. See more in @TIME and follow me here on Twitter to see how I’m fighting for change in

Over 40,000 Californians are furloughed or working without pay because of the #TrumpShutdown. Some have resorted to borrowing from retirement accounts or GoFundMe accounts or missing loan payments. That’s unacceptable. #EndTheShutdown
Our TSA officers are working without pay—including mandatory overtime—because of the #TrumpShutdown. That’s not good security, and puts all Americans at risk. #EndTheShutdown

I was thrilled to have my kids for my first week in DC, but it also helped me reflect again on the challenges of balancing work and being a mom. As I told @politico, work-life balance is not like perfectly balanced scales—it’s balance like riding a bike; just keep moving forward!
Last Friday, I joined @HouseDemocrats in introducing #HR1 to reduce the influence of big money on Congress. With Washington working again for Orange County families instead of special interests, we can act on: healthcare, clean energy, gun violence prevention,and more.
My thoughts are with the victims of last night’s shooting in Torrance and their families. One of the first things I did after being elected was join the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, because we must do more to prevent tragedies like this. #EnoughIsEnough
Yesterday, I was sworn in to represent #CA45, with my kids at my side. I’m ready to get Washington working better for OC families. Follow here to see how I’m fighting for healthcare, campaign finance reform, clean energy, and gun violence prevention #ForThePeople.
