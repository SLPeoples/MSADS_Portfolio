Statement on Hurricane Michael Funding
Cutting your taxes isn’t the only thing that @HouseGOP has done...#BetterOffNow
A copy of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers October 3, 2018 statement can be found here: cc: @USACE_FortWorth
Nor is it a secret that as a result of recent Hurricane recovery and relief efforts being stretched thin over the past two years, the current federal budget is step-funding (using incremental appropriation) for its other flood-control and water infrastructure projects.
Clearly, it is no secret that such funding will be spread over several years to match the progress of the state and local government partners as in the pending completion by TxDOT on the project's new bridges.
The Trinity River Vision flood control project is both strongly supported by the Corps and has received Congressional approval (2016) for matching federal funding ($526 million).
This statement from the Corps is appreciated as it clarifies any misleading interpretations caused by Wednesday's McClatchy Fort Worth Star-Telegram article.
In the October 3, 2018 statement released by Corps, they declare: "The Trinity River Vision/Central City project continues to embody the vision of safety for the people of North Texas through the flood risk management and ecosystem improvement missions of the Corps."
Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers once again strongly affirmed its commitment to the Trinity River Vision flood control project and acknowledged that it is authorized for federal funding in this coming year's 2019 Energy and Water Development Act.

It is critical that the @DeptofDefense has predictable and timely funding so that Mattis and our military leadership can plan with accurate funding levels.  For the first time in nine years, we have done just that.
It is our most basic responsibility to ensure our troops are ready to defend our nation, and that they have the very best training and the most effective weapons available.
I worked in lockstep with @DeptofDefense Secretary Mattis to ensure this bill provides the critical-funding needed to implement the new National Defense Strategy, and to continue rebuilding our armed forces.

I also believe the upcoming @realDonaldTrump-Putin meetings can build on the work that was done in the past few days in Russia and represent an important opportunity for national security and world peace.
We hope to begin an ongoing dialogue with this group and I am personally convinced that future discussions are essential and can be helpful to our long-term relationship with the Russians.
We also made it clear that we can and should remain in dialogue as we try and work through our policy differences.
We were blunt in our conversations with the Russians; we expressed our grave concerns about their policies and explained that any involvement in our elections is unacceptable.  We stated that we can be competitors without being adversaries.
The goal of these meetings was to begin addressing several of the geopolitical challenges facing the US relationship with Russia, including our differences in Syria, Ukraine, the Russian interference in the 2016 election and US sanctions on Russia.

Rest assured I will continue to work on this crisis.  I am hopeful that this week the House will pass a bill that keeps families together, strengthens our borders, and reforms our broken immigration system.
I have been working with House Republican leadership to resolve this in a way that protects our borders and our values. I, along with my colleagues, met with President Trump and he said he is 1000% with us and agrees these children must be protected.
After my personal experience of traveling to the border and to the countries where most of the immigrants were originating, it was clear to me that we had a humanitarian crisis on our hands.  I will say again what I said then, this urgent crisis must be dealt with immediately.
In 2014, I led a Border Crisis Working Group to understand the facts of the situation at the southern border.
People in my District are very concerned about this issue and so am I. There needs to be a better way to secure our borders that doesn’t tear apart families. These children did not make the choice to cross the border and shouldn’t be punished for it.

This bill does what General Dunford, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of staff has asked, it ‘ensures the joint force has the depth, flexibility, readiness and responsiveness that ensures our men and women will never face a fair fight.’
Our military must have the resources it needs to respond to and deter threats from countries like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and also counter violent extremists throughout the world.
It is a product of countless meetings and briefings with our military leaders and demonstrates our commitment to ensuring the U.S. military is the strongest, most capable military in the world.

I hope the Senate will pass this bill as soon as possible so that the president can sign these historic spending cuts into law. I urge all members to support this common sense proposal.
It also no longer rescinds funding for Hurricane Sandy victims.
This bill is a welcome step to cut wasteful spending and restore fiscal sanity to Washington. Importantly, the rescissions package on the floor today no longer rescinds Ebola funding. Sadly, that horrible virus has recently returned to the Democratic Republic of Congo.
As a senior member of the House Appropriations Committee, I understand more than most that President Trump’s proposal rescinding nearly $15 billion is necessary.It’s common sense that money sitting in federal coffers and not being spent should be returned to the treasury.
We must always be careful stewards of the taxpayer’s hard-earned money. That’s why I was proud to sign on as an original co-sponsor of President Trump’s rescissions package.

It’s also fitting that this historic action took place 70 years to the day that President Truman recognized Israel as an independent country. I urge other countries to follow the Unites States’ lead and locate their embassies in Israel’s eternal capital.
I would like to commend President Trump for moving our embassy to Jerusalem. Every nation should have the right to choose its own capital, and the president’s decision simply recognized this reality.
