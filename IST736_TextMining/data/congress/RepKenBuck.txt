On #InternationalWomensDay I would like to acknowledge the amazing women who stand up for what’s right and challenge the norm. Women are the force that lead our families, communities, society. I wish to extend my sincere appreciation to all the women who make this world better.
Following repeated anti-Semitic remarks, Democrats produced a resolution that was so watered-down, it failed to address a very real problem. I voted against the resolution that was nothing more than a political exercise. Read my full statement HERE:
TUNE IN- I’ll be live in just a few minutes with @630khow
TUNE IN: I'll be live in just a few minutes with Mandy Connell on @KOANewsRadio to talk about DACA and other things happening in Washington this week!
This isn’t just a terrible policy, it’s another attempt by Democrats to rewrite the underlying rules of the U.S. political system to steal our elections and skew those rules to only benefit themselves. #NOTForThePeople #HR1
#HR1 is #NOTForThePeople, it is designed to take your taxpayer dollars and put them towards a special piggy bank to finance campaigns and political agendas of other candidates. This is a direct violation of every Americans’ Constitutional right to freedom of association.
RT @GriffinConnolly: The House @freedomcaucus is launching a
I’m proud to co-sponsor the Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act (H.R. 1175) to make current Federal Excise Tax rates for small independent breweries permanent. By doing so, we enable these #breweries to expand their business hire more workers in our communities!
It was great meeting with members from the Colorado Apartment Association to discuss Section 8 rental assistance, expanding affordable housing options for low and moderate income Americans, and regulatory reform in the housing industry. #CAAHQ #CO04
Today, I spoke before @JudiciaryGOP about Democrats plan to bring forward a blanket, amnesty-only DACA bill that won’t go anywhere. Watch my remarks here:
I recently sent a letter to @USDOT supporting a grant application for much-need infrastructure improvements at Vance Brand Airport in Longmont, CO. We must ensure that #Longmont has the resources it needs to continue growing as an economic powerhouse on the Front Range! ️

Proud to join @RepAlLawsonJR in reintroducing the APEX Act to ensure a fair and free market for #aluminum pricing so our nation’s beverage companies can continue to produce some of America’s most popular beverages! Read my full statement here:
Good economic news. Let's keep it up!
If a child finds a firearm in a park and their parent surrenders the gun to a nearby police officer, the transfer shouldn’t be criminalized! But that’s what will happen under #HR8 the Democrats gun control bill. Watch my floor remarks HERE: #Support2A
The Dems gun control bill criminalizes gun transfers between law-abiding citizens who have NO criminal record and NO criminal intent! #2ndAmendment #Support2A
#ICYMI last night I joined my colleagues on the House Floor to talk about the greatest threat to our nation: the #nationaldebt. Watch my remarks here:
We cannot keep adding to our national debt annual deficit. It is not only unsustainable, but it is an unfair burden to place on future generations. I’m proud to be a cosponsor and would like to thank @RepAndyBiggsAZ for recognizing our country’s serious spending problem.
TUNE IN: I’ll be live in just a few minutes on @KOANewsRadio with @AprilZesbaugh @ContactLenz_KOA to discuss President Trump’s national emergency declaration
Next week, Democrats will bring flawed #HR8 to the House floor. It WON’T stop criminals! It WILL criminalize a friend or step-parent loaning a gun to a victim of domestic violence so she can defend herself! #2ndAmendment
Today we pay tribute to all the courageous leaders who have helped shape our great nation. Happy #PresidentsDay!
"If illegal immigrants are going to get guns then we better tell ICE...so that ICE can arrest them and deport them and make this country safer." Democrats would prefer to keep ICE from knowing when illegal immigrants try to purchase guns. Read here:
#ICYMI this morning, listen to my reaction to the border security deal and the president's decision to declare a national emergency on @KOANewsRadio here:
Tune-in on @KOANewsRadio now!
COMING UP: I'll be joining @IngrahamAngle with @HeyTammyBruce to talk about the bad border security deal that Congress put forth less than 24 hours ago. Tune in at 10PM ET (8PM MT) on @FoxNews
The American people deserve better than this terrible deal. I will be voting NO on this bill that continues the pattern of reckless spending, ties our ICE agents’ hands, and fails to secure our southern border.
It took Democrats less than TWO months to break their new rule requiring all Members have at least 72hrs to review bills. This 1,169 page bill was filed at 12:05AM had a new division added at 1:20AM. We aren’t even getting 24hrs to review all the terrible things in this bill!
How is this deal a compromise? It funds only 55 miles of fencing for $1.375 billion along a limited section of the border in exchange for preventing ICE from doing their jobs, including deporting MS-13 gang members. All while continuing out of control federal spending.
So Andrew McCabe and his cronies at the Justice Department conspired to invoke the 25th Amendment to target and remove @POTUS from office. This is nothing short of a coup by the FBI. It is absolutely disgraceful everyone involved deserves to be prosecuted to the fullest extent.
Here in Washington, we have a duty to the Constitution and to the American people to declare oversee our country’s war efforts. Today, I was glad to see my amendment adopted to the War Powers Resolution with bipartisan support. Watch my remarks here:
Today, @JudiciaryGOP considered my amendment to #HR8 to 'Restore Individuals’ Second Amendment Rights.' This is about giving non-violent criminal offenders a second chance and restoring individuals' gun rights. Watch my remarks here:
Our national debt just topped $22 trillion dollars for the first time. This is unfair to the American people. Even worse, it is an unfair burden to place on our children. I believe both parties need to come together and find ways to limit and reduce spending.
I am deeply saddened by the passing of my dear friend and colleague, @RepWalterJones. He was a dedicated public servant to the people of North Carolina for over two decades and he will be missed by many. May God bless him and grant his family peace.
Iran continues to develop its missile capabilities despite UNSC action. We must ensure that the Iranian regime does not gain a nuclear weapon and hold them accountable for violating international law.
Today @RepZoeLofgren and I introduced bipartisan legislation, the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019 (H.R. 1044), to eliminate arbitrary per-country limits that cause backlogs in the employment-based green card system. Read HERE:
Everyone's voice deserves to be heard, especially one of our own @HouseGOP.
.@HouseJudiciary is meeting today to discuss legislation to prevent mass violence. #HR8 claims to be a solution, but solves nothing. It’s disingenuous to advocate for new laws that won’t work while refusing to enforce current laws that would prevent violent crimes.
#ICYMI: Listen to my radio interview with @KOANewsRadio this morning
Over the last two years, we have made great strides. Tonight @POTUS  reaffirmed his commitment to offer common sense, bipartisan solutions to achieve American greatness. I’m eager to work with President Trump to support our promises to the American people. #SOTU
Tonight, @POTUS will deliver the #SOTU. I encourage you to watch the live stream from the @WhiteHouse. I want to hear from you so feel free to share your thoughts with me below.
Great to see a Colorado native nominated to lead the Department of the @Interior! David Bernhardt @DOIDepSec brings tremendous leadership with him from our home state of #Colorado and I look forward to a swift confirmation process.
#ICYMI: Last week, I re-introduced the WATER Act to keep water affordable for our local communities across #Colorado. My friend @SenCoryGardner will be introducing the Senate companion bill as well. For more information on this legislation, read here:
As the situation in #Venezuela worsens, we stand ready to act. The #Maduro regime's decision to violently crack down on its citizens must not be tolerated. Over 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2015. It is clear that change is needed:
Under no circumstance should we allow infanticide in this country. It is wrong and it is against everything we stand for. Coming from a Pediatric Neurologist who has spent a lifetime caring for children, I find @GovernorVA #RalphNortham's comments absolutely horrendous. Watch:
Glad I could join my colleagues to discuss a constitutional issue that needs to be addressed, and I hope we can pass this War Powers Resolution in the House to reclaim our legislative authority over war-making activities in Congress for the sake of our men and women in uniform.
House Judiciary held its first hearing on #HR1 to “restore our democracy.” This bill does the exact opposite. Instead of protecting the integrity of our elections it encourages voter fraud undermines the American electoral system. Here are my remarks:
Our elections should be fair and free from all forms of manipulations. H.R. 1 on the other hand, promotes voter fraud and uses taxpayer money to fund partisan political campaigns. @JudiciaryGOP
#ICYMI: Listen to my radio interview with @KOANewsRadio this morning
Students have different learning styles and needs. Meeting these needs is critical to our children’s success. Join me in celebrating #SchoolChoiceWeek, because every child deserves an education that will allow them to grow and thrive. #NSCW2019
Today I was named the Ranking Member of the @JudiciaryGOP Subcommittee on Immigration and Citizenship. My colleagues and I have an important role to play in addressing our broken immigration system. I’m looking forward to getting to work.
Americans across the country traveled to D.C. to #MarchforLife. I stand with them because I believe in the inherent value of every human life. We must do everything we can to promote policies that protect life for every human being, especially for our most vulnerable: the unborn.
RT @BreitbartNews: "They don't take Ken Buck's name when they assume somebody's identity." —@RepKenBuck
Today, we salute the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect ours. I would like to thank all law enforcement agents across the great state of Colorado for the sacrifices made daily to ensure the safety of our communities. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay #BacktheBlue
Last night, Weld County Fair Board hosted its Coronation for the 2019 Weld County Fair Royalty Program. I'd like to congratulate these 3 young ladies who will proudly represent Weld County Fair in 2019 I look forward to hearing about all your efforts to support our communities.
Merry Christmas to you and your family! What a time to reflect on the many blessings God has given us. In the dark of night he offered his son to the world, and in doing so he offered us salvation. I hope you enjoy time with family and friends this Christmas.
I commend the EPA for reworking this rule in a way that sets boundaries on the federal government’s jurisdiction. I trust that states and local property owners can steward their water resources better than bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.
Congratulations to Matthew Paris, winner of the #CongressionalAppChallenge for the 4th District! Matthew's app, "Home Safe," makes it easier for people to get out of problematic situations. I'm proud of everyone who participated in the #CAC this year.
I’m saddened to hear about the passing of former President George HW Bush. His record is one of selfless service to this country, and for that we all thank him. As he and Barbara are now reunited, we keep the rest of his family in our prayers. #41
Scott Eden used his #TCJA #TaxCuts to help his employees and grow his company. Good policy has good consequences. Watch his story here:
Putting more money into the pockets of small business owners allows them to pay higher wages and grow their business. That's one reason why we passed the #TaxCutsandJobsAct.
I'm focused on making sure that the price of aluminum in America is set in a fair and consistent manner, for all the industries and consumers in Colorado who rely on aluminum in products.
I'm thankful the law enforcement officers involved in this incident are all safe and I'm grateful for their vigilance.
Congratulations to all the men and women at Lockheed Martin Space in Colorado who played a part in building NASA's #InSight Lander, which touched down on Mars this afternoon!
Happy #Thanksgiving! I hope everyone has a chance today to reflect on the ways they're thankful. I'm grateful today for a loving family, for a caring community, and for a country that believes in freedom.
On #WorldDiabetesDay, we have a chance to recognize the 29 million Americans and their families who struggle with this difficult disease.
Thank you to those men and women who have served, and thank you to the families and friends who have supported those who have served. #veteransday
Today, we mark the many American lives lost in #WorldWarI. Though distant from our present day, their fight greatly influenced the world we know today, ushering in a world order that prioritizes American values like peace, democracy, and free markets.
Thank you to all who have, all who are, and all who will call themselves a United States Marine. #MarineCorpsBirthday

Great jobs numbers this morning!
If we want Congress to work better for the people, then we need to change the way we do business around here. Read this op-ed I co-authored with @repderekkilmer to learn about our ideas for reform:
My heart is with those impacted by the senseless violence against citizens who were simply practicing their freedom to worship. We need to stand together against violence—sending a strong message that attacks on officials, worshipers, or any Americans are unacceptable.
Today is the DEA’s prescription drug take back day. Learn more at this link and participate in our nation’s effort to combat the opioid crisis:
Guatemala is a strategic partner for the U.S. I thank President Morales for visiting the United States and I hope we can develop a closer friendship between our nations during his visit.
Great economic news this morning. Our economy is thriving, but that doesn't mean we should stop fighting for free-market policies that promote job creation and economic growth.
My District Director, Robin Coran, had a great day getting coffee with law enforcement officers in Douglas County. Thanks so much to those who choose this line of work. We know it's challenging sometimes, and we really shouldn't take for granted the cost you pay to keep us safe.
Important data on wage growth. Rolling back excessive regulation and lowering taxes frees more dollars for employers to pay their employees.
Today, I voted for Tax Reform 2.0. This legislation makes permanent most of the tax cuts that impact individuals and families.
RT @SpeakerRyan: More than 100 lives are lost each day to the #OpioidCrisis. Think about that—100 Americans each day. That’s why this situa…
I'm thankful that Congress has included language from my opioid legislation into a bicameral, bipartisan package to combat the opioid epidemic in this country. My provisions keep wholesalers and law enforcement on the same page with each
I'm thankful my language to enhance data-sharing between wholesalers and law enforcement made it into the final, bicameral, bipartisan opioid agreement legislation.
We need to reassert Congress' Constitutional duty to declare and oversee war-making in this country. Watch C-SPAN tonight around 7 MT when I'll be leading an hour of bipartisan floor time on this topic. Also, check out my op-ed on the issue:
"War is a decision with real costs. My son is a captain in the U.S. Army, and although I’ve been in Congress for four years, I’ve never had the chance to vote on where, when and how our military is deployed. We can do better."
The deadline to register for the Congressional App Challenge is fast approaching! If you're a student in the 4th Congressional District, I encourage you to consider competing in the app challenge this year.
Today, we remember those who were prisoners of war and those who are missing in action, as well as their families. Thank you to those who pay the high price to protect our freedom.
Enjoyed chatting about my time as a staffer on the Hill with Roll Call recently:
Congratulations to Guatemala and President Morales on the nation's 197th anniversary of independence! I was honored to visit this country last year and meet President Morales to discuss the strong friendship between our nations-we're working together for peace and stability.
Glad to see that HR 5635, The Medical Cannabis Research Act, was adopted by voice in @HouseJudiciary today. This bill wisely regulates medical marijuana research and helps our veterans by allowing the VA to discuss potential medical marijuana trials with them.
We reported HR 6755 out of @HouseJudiciary today, which adds another federal judge for Colorado to help with caseloads.
We need to keep taxes low and regulations rolled back so that businesses in this nation can keep adding jobs.
Police and prisons are not responsible for violent crime. Criminals are responsible for violent crime. #HR6691 defines crimes of violence so that our criminal code is no longer ambiguous. I clarified some of these facts for my colleagues in this video:
Free market policies help all industries in Colorado, including the beer industry:
If we want economic growth and job creation, then we need to ensure the federal government decides on permitting applications in an efficient matter. That's why this markup of the Permitting Litigation Efficiency Act is so important today in @HouseJudiciary
I'm competing in the Brew Across America contest with my special Brew, Rocky Melon Madness brewed at Anheuser-Busch in Fort Collins. I need your support for the people's choice award. Text Buck to 202-883-6007 as soon as possible to support this Colorado beer!
Discussing my beer, Rocky Melon Madness, with the brewmasters who helped me create it. I'm excited to compete against my fellow members tonight at the Brew Across America Festival. Relying on the Rocky Ford Hirikata melons in this beer to propel us to the top. #BrewDemocracy
A few weeks ago I toured Anheuser-Busch's brewing facilities in Ft. Collins and brewed my own beer, Rocky Melon Madness, to compete in the Brew Across America Festival tonight. We'll see how my beer does tonight-the special ingredient is watermelon from Rocky Ford. #BrewDemocracy
My prayers and deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of the young boy lost this morning at the Harvest Parade.
I'm thankful for Senator McCain's many decades of service to our nation and my prayers go out to his family tonight.
I had a great meeting with members of the Longmont Chamber of Commerce this week. We talked about ways to create an economic environment for growth and job creation. Thanks to everyone who attended! @LACC528
I’m truly saddened by the loss of Mollie Tibbetts. It is one more reminder that Congress needs to fix our broken immigration system.
I had the chance to brew my own beer during a visit to the Anheuser-Busch Brewery in Fort Collins. My recipe includes melons from Hirikata Farms in our district--so I'm sure it will be a winner in the #BrewDemocracy contest against other members later this year. #BAA2018
Thanks to everyone in Burlington who came to the listening session on Spaceport Colorado that my staff held. Please reach out to us if you weren't able to make it and have comments or concerns.
We must protect the religious freedom of faith-based institutions. That's why I sent a letter to the Higher Learning Commission, asking them to withdraw recent proposed revisions to their accreditation criteria.
I voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act because I believed it would benefit Coloradans. Here's a story of a local business that used savings from the tax reform bill to reinvest in their employees. #TCJA #TaxCuts
"This bill makes sense. The ditch companies will benefit by being able to make additional revenue to invest in maintenance and upkeep of their operations, without putting at risk their nonprofit status, and we'll all benefit from less expensive water."
Watch CNN in 10 minutes to hear my thoughts on the articles of impeachment filed against Deputy AG Rosenstein.
We all rely on farmers and ranchers for our nation's food supply. That's why the WATER Act is so important.
I'm thankful for the bipartisan, unanimous support my bill, the WATER Act, received on the House floor today.
A lot of work still needs to be done to fix the VA system for our veterans. I'm excited to see Robert Wilkie start tackling these issues as he becomes the next Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Thank you to everyone who came to my town hall today to discuss the landmark tax reform bill. And thank you to Chairman Kevin Brady for sharing his knowledge on the bill with us.

Bruce Benson has served the university and the State of Colorado with passion, distinction, and honor. His impact will be remembered for years in the hearts of the individuals he helped.
I joined northern Colorado’s congressional delegation to send a letter to DOT Secretary Elaine Chao, urging her to consider our state’s application for a northern I-25 expansion grant. We must reduce congestion on I-25 to support our economy and preserve our environment.
I signed a bipartisan letter urging DOT Secretary Elaine Chao to fully and fairly hear our state’s application for a northern I-25 expansion grant. Dense traffic on this highway costs our citizens thousands of dollars. We must find a solution. #I25
Russia’s attempts to influence the 2016 election are disgraceful. We should work to improve American relations with our adversaries, but not at the cost of our nation’s soul.
Traffic congestion on northern I-25 costs thousands of dollars in lost productivity and increases the chance for accidents. That’s why I signed a bipartisan letter urging DOT Secretary Chao to favorably review our state’s application for a grant to expand northern I-25. #I25
I’m thankful for the chance to lead the Diversity Internship Program for Republicans in Congress, and I’m thankful for all the students who chose to participate this summer.
It’s unfortunate that a group of interns who are in Washington to learn about our democratic process and advance the cause of freedom and liberty faced discrimination for their political beliefs.
Keep the students and families impacted by this accident in your prayers.
I'm eager to hear the testimony of Peter Strzok in front of the @HouseJudiciary and @GOPoversight committees today. We need to find the truth and ensure the political independence and integrity of our law enforcement agencies.
Great economic news today. New hires are at the highest point they've been in 17 years. Thankful for deregulation, tax reform, and other legislation that has spurred job growth in this country.
After visiting Guatemala last summer, I know the important role played by Central America in combating human trafficking and illegal immigration. I’m thankful for President @jimmymoralesgt and his leadership in hosting multilateral talks on these issues.
I’m excited to see Judge Brett Kavanaugh serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. I urge my Senate colleagues to quickly confirm him.
On this day over 240 years ago, a group of revolutionaries pledged their lives, fortunes, and sacred honor to the founding of our nation. #IndepenceDay
Happy #IndependenceDay! On this day, let's celebrate the birth of this free country and hold dear the sacrifices of those patriots who risked everything to protect it.
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) can help those suffering from PTSD. That’s why I’m fighting to make #HBOT available to our veterans. #PTSDAwarenessMonth
Over 7.7 million Americans suffer from #PTSD and many of these individuals encountered trauma while fighting for our country. As we turn our attention to a week of celebrating freedom, let’s also remember those individuals who paid the cost for that freedom. #PTSDAwarenessMonth
June is #AlzheimersAwarenessMonth, a chance for us to remember those we’ve lost to the disease, encourage those who are fighting it, and look ahead to a future where we can conquer it.
Right now, over 5 million Americans live with Alzheimer’s, costing the nation $227 billion annually. #AlzheimersAwarenessMonth
I introduced the WATER Act, legislation that makes water affordable for rural communities and agriculture--and just last week it was reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee.
From its strong response to the 2013 floods to its focus on innovation and civic engagement, @cityoflongmont and its citizens are working to build a healthy and desirable place to raise families.
I'm very happy to see the City of Longmont named one of the National Civic League's All-American Cities.
On this day in 1788, the U.S. Constitution was ratified. Let's keep the Constitution, and the important amendments we've made to it, at the center of our policy-making for another couple of centuries.

Happy Flag Day! Today we celebrate the adoption of the American flag by the Second Continental Congress on June 14th, 1777. The flag is a reminder of our nation's endurance and the values that our country represents.
Happy Birthday to the United States Army! For 243 years, the brave soldiers of the #Army have protected our people and guarded our liberties. The men and women of the U.S. Army have secured America against many enemies, and we are thankful for their sacrifice for our nation.
I’m proud to co-sponsor the Good Samaritan Health Professionals Act. This common sense legislation will ensure that health care professionals will not be deterred, by the threat of frivolous lawsuits, from volunteering their services during a disaster. #HR1876
Thanks to #TaxReform, businesses in Colorado are growing and adding jobs. Here is one of their stories:
A recent report indicates that Planned Parenthood has deliberately failed to report suspected sexual abuse of minors in their care. We must get to the bottom of this. That's why I joined with my House colleagues to request that HHS investigate the matter.
After working for months with a bi-partisan group of members from Colorado's delegation, I'm proud to see Colorado receiving this grant funding:
I’ve worked hard with fellow Colorado Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to emphasize the importance of the I-25 Gap project. Receiving INFRA Grant dollars for I-25 will make Colorado better connected, benefiting our economy and our communities.
Our transportation infrastructure must meet the needs of Colorado’s growing population and bustling economy. That’s why I’m so excited that the I-25 GAP project received a large grant from the Department of Transportation.
If you have a few minutes today, take a listen to President Reagan's 40th Anniversary #DDay speech:
Today, we honor the sacrifices of the heroic soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy on #DDay. Thank you to all of our veterans who have fought for our freedom.
I was honored today to receive the Defender of Housing award from the National Association of Home Builders. We need to create policies that enable citizens to pursue their American dream, which often includes home ownership.
Today, we memorialize the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. Who went off to fight in a war and never returned. Who gave their lives for the ideals we cherish. Happy #MemorialDay and thank you to those who have served.
If you're a student in the 4th Congressional District, I encourage you to participate in this year's app challenge. We've had some great apps the last three years, and I'm looking forward to seeing what students create in 2018.
Last week, the House passed a bill allowing for federal prosecution of individuals who target police officers for violence. #NationalPoliceWeek
Last week, the House focused on legislation aiming to protect those men and women who put on a badge every day. #NationalPoliceWeek
Americans are confident that it's a good time to find quality jobs in this country. We need to continue supporting policies in Washington, like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, that promote job creation and business growth.
I'm praying for all those impacted by the tragic events in Texas today. Thank you to those first responders who bravely arrived at the scene.
When small business succeeds, so does our economy and our community. That's why the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was so important:
Today, on National Peace Officers Memorial Day, we honor those men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to keep our families safe. Thank you to all those who serve in law enforcement around our nation. #NationalPoliceWeek
I'm thankful for Spc. Gabriel Conde's sacrifice. Let's be praying for his family, friends, and fellow soldiers.
In moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States affirms our support of the nation of Israel and her values--freedom, democracy, and stability in the Middle East.
Happy Mother's Day! Thank you to the mothers in our district who have been so instrumental in raising up our communities.

Every student learns differently. Our education system should reflect this diversity. That's why Charter Schools are so important. #NationalCharterSchoolWeek
I had a chance to question the acting administrator of the DEA yesterday about the link between sanctuary city policies and the #opioidcrisis. We need all levels of law enforcement working together to fight this
I'm thankful that three Americans are headed home today. 
Teaching and nurturing our nation's children is an important and oftentimes challenging task. That's why this week, we should be especially thankful for the teachers in our lives. #TeacherAppreciationWeek
On average, 115 people die each day in this country from overdosing on opioids. And Colorado saw 159 heroin overdose deaths in 2015. We must find solutions to this epidemic, which is why this @HouseJudiciary hearing on the #opioidcrisis is so important.
Headed to a @HouseJudiciary hearing on the challenges and solutions of the opioid crisis. Watch live here:

H.R. 5617 defunds federal immigration enforcement dollars from cities in which sanctuary policies violate immigration law. Read more here:
We need to send a strong message to cities that choose to ignore the rule of law. H.R. 5617 sends that message.
America must maintain its competitive edge in space. Colorado companies big and small should be at the forefront of that.
Glad to see the new Memorandum of Understanding that streamlines the permitting process across federal agencies. The current process is complicated, unnecessarily spanning multiple agencies, causing delayed projects and high costs.
Thanks for chatting with me, @RepDerekKilmer! Looking forward to working with you in the House Reformers Caucus to make Congress work better for the people.
Please keep in your prayers all of those impacted by the fires burning across our district right now and those who are working to combat these blazes. Visit the map at this link to see which areas are affected:
Visit @RockyNPS for free this Saturday in honor of National Park Week!
If we want to fight the heroin epidemic ravaging our nation, then we need to get serious about enforcing the rule of law and removing illegal immigrant heroin traffickers from our streets.
I'm saddened tonight to learn of the passing of First Lady Barbara Bush. She deeply loved her family and the country she spent so many years serving, and her impact on our nation will not soon be forgotten. Let's be praying for her family during this time.
This year, Tax Day marks the end of an overbearing and unfair tax code. Starting next year, our tax code will be simpler and fairer thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. #TaxDay
Keeping an eye on these fires and praying for those impacted today in Douglas County:
Washington is called the swamp for a reason.
This week we remember a man who fought with incredible strength and conviction for what he knew was right. Martin Luther King Jr. was slain 50 years ago today. On this day, citizens across the country look back upon his legacy, upon his fight for freedom and justice. #MLK50
