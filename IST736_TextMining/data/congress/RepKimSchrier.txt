When scared parents are searching the internet about how to best protect their young children, websites like the @CDCgov’s should be the first results, not hoax videos. We must do more with fact-based #vaccines info. Read my full op-ed here:
Thrilled to join my colleagues to pass #HR1 today! We are putting the government back in the hands of the American people, where it has always belonged.
Nice to meet you this week, Dorothy! Glad to be working with you on our common goal of eliminating child hunger.
Leaders. Trailblazers. Artists. Politicians. Moms. Today and every day, we honor the women who have changed our lives and paved the way for us. #IWD2019
Professionals who are trained and ready are imperative to survivor support. #VAWA-funded grantees trained 11,519 sexual assault nurse and forensic examiners, 89,937 law enforcement officers, and 18,404 court personnel. Let’s reauthorize #VAWA
Had important art installed in my D.C. office today: my son Sam’s #lego U.S. Capitol!
As a pediatrician, I took an oath to “first do no harm.” I have talked w/ parents about vaccinating their kids understand the fear of making a wrong decision. Study after study has demonstrated the safety efficacy of immunizations. #Vaccines save lives.
Headed back to DC. Looking forward to voting for #HR1 this week, which will get big money out of politics, modernize secure our elections, and make sure public servants are actually serving the public. Let's get this done!
Definitely a step in the right direction!
This #WomensHistoryMonth I am proud to follow in the footsteps of the women who came before me. And continue to work with the record-breaking 131 women in Congress to fight for issues related to women, families, and equality. @HouseDemWomen
Sam and I are reading Schooled by Gordon Korman to celebrate #readacrossamerica! @EdLaborCmte

After too many years of "thoughts and prayers", we are finally getting something done to fix the gun violence epidemic in our country. Proud to support #HR8 #endgunviolence
Listening to witness testimony this morning on the use of seclusion and restraint in our schools.
Great news that the Lands Package passed, permanently authorizing the #LWCF, establishing a research program for wildfires and expands federal water projects in the Yakima Basin. Full release:
Proud to have voted for this! Women deserve equal pay for equal work. Period.
Sometimes you just have to work where you can.
This decision by the Canadian govt is highly irresponsible and puts our shared natural resources + Puget Sound orcas at risk. This is counter to what should be a global effort to move away from a fossil fuels towards clean energy. This is beyond disappointing. It is dangerous.
I had a wonderful time meeting with CAFÉ in Wenatchee today. We had a great conversation about the lifelong benefits of early childhood education, immigration reform, and how my first few months in Congress have been.
¡Muchísimas gracias a Café por organizar una gran cita comunitaria en Wenatchee! Tuvimos una gran conversación sobre los beneficios de una buena educación, reforma inmigratoria, y mi experiencia en el congreso.
Great crowd and thoughtful questions at my Wenatchee community forum this morning! Thank you to our panelists, especially Mayor Frank Kuntz for hosting us at the new City hall.

��‍️ Proud to be one of those cosponsors. As soon as I heard there was a resolution like this, I made sure to sign on. The President’s action sets a dangerous precedent.
The President’s gag rule is dangerous because patients deserve to know all of their options. Health care decisions should be left to patients and their provider-there’s no place for politics in the exam room. As a doctor, I strongly oppose the gag rule. #nogagrule
Learned a lot during a tour of the Cle Elum Fish Helix and it was impressive to see in person. The helix is critical to restoring fish habitats for tribal use and the overall environmental needs of our district.
It is incumbent on all of us to speak out when there is injustice, racism or xenophobia in our community. This is one example. I am speaking up to make clear that there is no place for hate in #WA08. This is a time to stand with all of our neighbors.
Learned a lot at the Mosby Brothers Farm. Can’t wait for more farms visits throughout the 8th district! @HouseAgDems

Home in the district this week. Enjoyed touring Home Depot and meeting the hardworking employees. Got to help out a constituent Casey by mixing his paint and ringing him out! #WA08
The President’s #nationalemergency is an abuse of power.
It is beyond frustrating that our President has declared a #NationalEmergency to get his wall funding. We Americans know what an emergency looks like. Families seeking asylum are not a national emergency and this an abuse of power.
This is what a compromise looks like. I applaud my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for hashing out an agreement that prevented a second, unnecessary shutdown. My full statement:
Today marks one year since the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. No parent should fear sending their child to school no child should fear going to school. We must commit ourselves to making sure this never happens again #MSDStrong

Great to hear from Washington’s-own Kristin from @MomsRising today on how #paycheckfairness affects moms and families! #WA08
All families should have access to #paidleave no matter where they live or work. As a pediatrician, I have seen firsthand that the #paidleave system is our country can use some updating. The #FAMILYAct will do just that!
Proud of you making the right decision, Ethan. Sorry that you had to wait 18 years.
If we thought things were bad under Zinke, this just shows that it could get a whole lot worse.

Proud to be working with you @RepNewhouse on this important issue in our districts and state! Hopefully this can be a model of collaboration for the rest of country.
Great to meet you!
RT @CentralWashU: University police reported that all buildings have been secured and the campus is safe and all-clear.
The average age of a child involved in an accidental shooting is 3. And  over 17,000 children and teens are injured or killed by gun violence every year. We must do better. #enoughisenough #EndGunViolence
Great to meet you and learn about Be The Match!
Glad to see the House holding a hearing on climate change for the first time in 8 years. We can’t ignore our � any longer! It's time to #ActOnClimate
Getting ready for my first @EdLaborCmte hearing on healthcare and preexisting conditions. Right in my wheelhouse!
Joining my colleagues in wearing white to show that we’re fighting #forthepeople and standing up for women’s rights. #sotu
Excited to have Issaquah resident Jenell as my #sotu guest tonight!
Background checks are a big part of gun safety. But guns must be stored safely so they don’t end up in the hands of children, or those who would do themselves or others harm.
Due to inclement weather, my office in Issaquah will be closed today. Stay safe and warm out there!
Yet another attempt to restrict women's access to healthcare. Rather than creating medically unwarranted barriers to abortion care, how about focusing on real threats to women like maternal mortality? Make no mistake, delayed abortion only increases risk to women. Enough!
If men and women do the same job, they should get the same pay. It’s that simple. Proud to be a sponsor of the #PaycheckFairness Act to ensure #EqualPay
Great to meet with Board of Directors members from several #WA08 school districts, including Bethel Issaquah! Had a meaningful discussion about how we can best support students of all ages and their teachers.

This #holocaustmemorialday, #weremember and honor those lives senselessly lost to bigotry. I will continue to stand up to hatred and intolerance in all forms.
Great to meet with Auburn Mayor Nancy Backus here in the other Washington!
Now let’s work together on sensible, evidence-based border security measures that will keep government open and prevent something like this from happening again. The American people should never be held hostage as a negotiating technique.
While I am happy that the shutdown will soon be over, it has been an incredibly frustrating month for hundreds of thousands of people who had to needlessly suffer. Let’s be clear: this is not a way to govern.
RT @GovInslee: This #TrumpShutdown has deeply impacted families and communities throughout WA. Today, at my direction, @ESDwaWorks implemen…
Listening to former Secretary Jeh Johnson speak about smart and effective border security this morning.
Today I read #ShutdownStories from my constituents on the floor. What the President offered on Saturday is no compromise. It's lip service. People are hurting. We need to reopen the government now.
We're 1 month into the #shutdown. 800,000 employees will not receive a 2nd paycheck this week with many families finding it increasingly hard to put food on the table. We must #EndTheShutdown and get the gov't working #ForThePeople
46 years after #RoevWade and we still cannot count on abortion remaining safe and legal. I stand strong against all efforts to curb women's access to reproductive healthcare. Stand with me. #Roe46
Honoring #MLKDay with service at the MTS Greenway with Sam and David. What we did today plays a big role in protecting the environment for future generations.

I stand with the Dreamers in my district who say “No deal.” And I stand with federal workers, contractors, and others who are being hurt by the shutdown. Reopen the government now. Then let’s talk about smart border security and reforming our immigration system.
I’m home in the district and I wanted to meet with people affected by the #shutdown. Last night I visited @NATCA members to learn about what they do and how vital their work is. They continue to work hard to keep the skies safe despite the shutdown.
The “chick pic” is up!
Thank you @RepJayapal and the rest of the WA delegation for today’s official welcome with the handoff of the infamous “chick pic.” I’ll make sure it finds a prominent place in my office! �
I am honored to be joining the Education and Labor Committee, and the Committee on Agriculture.
7.52 miles and none in tennis shoes! SO glad I wasn’t in heels for those 16,131 steps on marble floors yesterday! I’ll bet 2 of those miles were from getting lost in the Capitol.
My mom was a UTLA member in the 70’s and walked the picket lines then. I stand with @UTLAnow in their fight today.
I'm honored to be part of this diverse Freshman class in Congress! As this amazing photo project reminded me, we have come a long way, but there is still more work to do.

This is now the longest shutdown in history. Today I sat down with representatives from IAM 751 and the Washington State Labor Council, @FaithActionWA, @NWHarvest, Bread for the World, @NPCA, @PortofSeattle @NATCA to hear how the shutdown is affecting them.
It's time to #EndTheShutdown
Calling constituents back this afternoon about the #GovernmentShutdown
Looking forward to speaking with you in a few minutes!
We need to #endtheshutdown for the orchardists who rely on farm subsidies, children families who count on food stamps to make ends meet, and the Rangers who keep our beautiful public places safe and pristine.
Thanks for stopping by!
As the lone woman doctor in Congress, and as a patient with Type 1 Diabetes, I look forward to leading healthcare conversation in my new role:
Just walked off the floor after giving my first floor speech! As the House’s lone female pediatrician, it was important to me to talk about protecting #healthcare. Check back for a video clip later today!
Excited to sponsor #HR8, a bipartisan bill that would implement universal background checks. Especially poignant to be joined at the press conference by @GabbyGiffords on the 8th anniversary of the horrific attack on her.

Residents of the 8th District, reply to this tweet to let me know how the #shutdown is affecting you and your family day-to-day. Your stories will help me best represent you as I work to get the government re-opened.
I'm proud to join my colleagues in sponsoring the #ForThePeople Act (HR 1)– our plan to make public servants actually serve the public and limit the influence of big money and special interests. We need a transparent government by the people, for the people
RT @RepJayapal: Washington’s in the House! Happy to welcome @RepKimSchrier to “the other Washington” and to the #116thCongress! ��
Kim spoke with Vice News Tonight earlier this week about her first days in Congress and why it is important to have elected officials who are scientists.
It happened! Kim was joined by her husband and son, her parents, and her aunt and uncle for her swearing in ceremony yesterday.
Kim and her son on the way to the Capitol before she is sworn in.
Kim is proud and ready to serve the 8th district!
