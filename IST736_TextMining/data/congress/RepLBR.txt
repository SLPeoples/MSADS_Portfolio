Health care. Climate change. Data security. Clean energy. All are big-picture challenges we face today and in the future. I look forward to serving you, sharing your stories and bringing Delaware's perspective to the table on the @EnergyCommerce Committee.
This month, I'm applauding the amazing women of the First State who stood up to and challenged gender inequality, blazed trails, and broke down barriers for all women. This #WomensHistoryMonth, follow #HerStoryDE to learn about the Delaware women who shaped our past and present.
Today and every day, we honor the women who have come before us, and we fight for the women who will come after us. #IWD2019 #InternationalWomensDay
Today, we're making history. By passing #HR1, the #ForthePeopleAct, we're cleaning up Washington, getting big money out of politics, and protecting your right to vote. Let's reform our democracy so we can put the power back in the hands of the people. #ForThePeople
Nearly 25 years ago, Congress enacted the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act in the fight to end domestic violence in America. Today, Congress introduced legislation to reauthorize the #VAWA and ensure all survivors have access to the resources and safety they deserve.
This weekend, I joined @repjohnlewis in Selma, AL. He recounted his courageous experience during the #SelmaMarch. Together, my colleagues I stood up for equality voting rights across the country, while honoring the sacrifices made in achieving those rights. �: @CapehartJ

When I was young, #ShirleyChisholm’s trailblazing run for President inspired me. And when I was sworn in, she was there in spirit – folding chair in hand.
The #HBCU Partners Act can make lasting changes to historically black colleges – tapping into talented students at prestigious HBCUs across the
She is a trailblazer who broke down barriers and played a dynamic role in Delaware government for over three decades. I am fortunate to call her friend and mentor, and I thank Senator Henry for helping make our state a better and just place for all Delawareans. #BHM
Sen. Henry’s influence extended beyond her role in the General Assembly. In her non-profit career, she served as Executive Director of  Now, Girls Inc., which empowers young women and girls across the state.
She championed bills that provided cost limits on prescription medication and fought out-of-school suspensions for minor infractions, which disproportionately impact students of color. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
In one of her many focus areas, Sen. Henry was dedicated to protecting voter’s rights. She sponsored and helped pass legislation that fought voting discrimination, allowed same-day voter registration, and restored voting rights for convicted felons. #BHM
Her tenure as a public servant began in 1994 when she became the first African American woman to serve in the Delaware State Senate and later as Senate Majority Leader. Throughout her career in the GA, she was a trailblazer and civil rights leader. #BHM
For over 30 years, Delaware’s former State Senator and living legend Margaret Rose Henry, has helped define service and community advocacy in Delaware. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
I'm proud to have earned a 94% score on @LCVoters' 2018 #LCVScorecard! In Congress, I'll continue to fight for:�️ Climate action� Our public lands� Clean water protections️ A just transition to clean energy� Environmental equality in every zip code
 Nearly 40K Americans lose their lives each year to gun violence Americans are 25x more likely to be killed by guns than others in developed nations 90% of people support universal background checks It's the right thing to doThis is why I support #HR8. #EndGunViolence
Gun violence has taken innocent lives in our schools, communities, and places of worship, while Congress stood idly by offering thoughts and prayers instead of action. Today, that stops. I'm voting for #HR8 so we can keep communities safe #ForThePeople and address this epidemic.
Today, I joined @EnergyCommerce Democrats in taking a step forward to protect consumer data #ForThePeople. In the era of big data, Americans have the right to protect their personal information and enshrine their right to digital privacy.
Your vote is your voice in our Democracy. It is more important than ever to mobilize our electorate around the VRA protect the fundamental right to vote nationwide. #RestoreTheVote
There is nothing more sacred in our democracy than the right to vote. That's why I stand with my colleagues in Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE! #VRAA
We have a responsibility to honor our history and #RestoreTheVOTE. We cannot be silent in the face of discrimination.

Joined @USAmbSV for a productive conversation about how to further strengthen #ElSalvador and improve conditions to prevent irregular migration.
I had a blast at the Sankofa Cultural Arts Center last weekend and was thrilled to join the Dover community in celebrating #BHM⁠ ⁠. Our community benefits from cultural organizations that aim to enrich, educate, and promote our heritage through the arts.
Last weekend, I announced the winner of the Delaware Congressional Art Award at @DelStateUniv. Congratulations to Ava Mass for her painting, Plastic Sunrise! Thank you to every student who entered their work. We are lucky to have such talent in our art community!

@cbjazzfest Clifford Brown is widely regarded as having expanded the limits and definition of American jazz music. #BHM #DelawareBlackHistory
Though his life was short, Wilmington continues to honor his lasting influence annually with the @cbjazzfest. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
Brown had a natural aptitude for music, forming the Brown-Roach quintet and recording a series of scores throughout his life. In 1954, he composed "Joy Spring," one of his greatest and most recognized hits.
Clifford Brown was a founding father of bebop. His distinguished career in jazz was defined by his pioneering sound and graceful technique. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
�ATTN� Delaware farmers, the Market Facilitation Program is now offering direct payments to any commodities, including soy and corn, negatively impacted by foreign tariffs. Farmers can apply before Feb. 14th to be eligible. Link here ️️️

I was pleased to hear POTUS make the commitment to end HIV in the US by 2030. While he was short on details, there are real ways to make this happen. On National Black HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, let's recommit to ending the epidemic and taboo. #KnowYourStatus
Loper pushed for diversifying the field - painting a way for others to follow. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
His work is now immortalized by permanent collections in Paul R. Jones Collection of African-American Art, @philamuseum, and @ngadc, @americanart museum. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
For 70 years, he taught the next generation of artists at the Delaware College of Art and Design and other institutions - cultivating an appreciation of art within the community.
Loper’s signature technique is defined by color and vibrancy. He frequently painted landscapes of his beloved neighborhood in Wilmington. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
He was the first African American to be featured in the Delaware Art Museum in 1937 with several notable exhibitions and shows, including a retrospective of his work in 1996. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
As a self-trained artist, Loper started drawing in the Work Progress Association during WWII, rendering 113 illustrations.
Born in 1916, Edward Loper Sr. would become one of Delaware's most visionary artists. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
Tonight, @staceyabrams delivered a message about what our country truly stands for - opportunity, prosperity, and equality. ������ We are stronger when our government fights #forthepeople. I stand with @HouseDemocrats in creating justice in our health care, economy, and society.
Tonight, I join @HouseDemWomen in wearing suffragette white to the #SOTU. We're standing in solidarity with the women who blazed trails and whose shoulders we stand on. With your help, Congress now looks more like the people it represents. #WomenLead
Happy #ChineseNewYear! I wish everyone great prosperity, joy, and good fortune in the Year of the Pig! #LunarNewYear
No child should ever endure bullying. Skin color, gender identity, last name - it should never happen. As elected leaders, it's on us to set an example for how to treat one another. Joshua, glad you'll be joining us and enjoy your time in DC! #SOTU
Shadd Cary was a trailblazer in advancing the causes of African Americans and women in Delaware and across our country. I am pleased that Shadd Cary is now receiving the attention and acclaim that her influential life deserves. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
Later, Shadd Cary would join the National Woman Suffrage Association and work alongside prominent figures in the movement to fight for the right to vote for women everywhere. She was one of the first 1st African American women to cast their ballot in a national election. #BHM
After having moved to Canada to avoid being captured into slavery, Shadd Cary moved back to the US where she would go on to teach at black schools in Wilmington and receive a law degree from Howard University School of Law - the second black woman in the US to earn a law degree.
At the time, even mainstream abolitionist newspapers only featured white authors. Shadd Cary's paper was one of the first to include stories, poetry, and letters from the best and brightest in the black community. #BHM
In 1853, Shadd Cary became the first black woman to publish and edit a North American newspaper, the Provincial Freedom. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
Hailing from Wilmington, DE, Mary Ann Shadd Cary is remembered as an extraordinary abolitionist, suffragette, and journalist. Born to a free family, Shadd Cary devoted her life to defending the voiceless and fighting for equality at the ballot box and in our society. #BHM
Redding also played an instrumental role in opening up the @UDelaware to black students. By using his legal mind, Redding stood up to injustice, created new opportunities to learn, advanced the rights of African Americans across the nation. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
As the 1st African American to be admitted to the Delaware bar, Louis Redding’s career was spent fighting for equality inclusion. He was a member of the @NAACP legal team that challenged school segregation in the landmark #SCOTUS case Brown V. Board of Education. #BHM
Throughout Black History Month, I will lift up the voices of influential Black Delawareans whose impact has moved the First State in a positive, more inclusive direction. #DelawareBlackHistory #BHM
This month, let us celebrate the contributions of Delaware’s rich African American community. These men and women blazed trails, created art that captivates us, and spoke truth to power – challenging conventional ways of thinking.

NOW: I'm standing with @SpeakerPelosi, @HouseDemocrats, and the trailblazing Lilly Ledbetter in the fight for #PayCheckFairness. #EqualPay
In Congress, I will continue to advocate for a federal #ERA that eliminates discrimination on the basis of sex for women everywhere. #ERAnow
Thanks to @RepLonghurst and Senator Stephanie Hansen's hard work, the Delaware General Assembly has taken an active role in leading on this issue by recently passing the #ERA. #NetDE
10 years ago, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter #FairPay Act into law – a milestone for working women. As we honor this achievement, we must continue to press for equality throughout our society. That’s why I am proud to support the #PaycheckFairnessAct the #ERA.
These funds will help prevent families from going homeless, rehouse families that have slipped through the cracks, and explore innovative measures to combat homelessness in our communities. #NetDE
That's why I was proud to join @SenatorCarper and @JohnCarneyDE in applauding the @FHLBankPgh and the @DEStateHousing Authority for making $1.2 million available to social service providers across Delaware.
On a daily basis in Delaware, nearly 1,000 people, including 200 children, are affected by homelessness. We can do something about it.
Homelessness touches the lives of far too many, and as someone who grew up in public housing, I know firsthand how important it is to help our most vulnerable neighbors keep roofs over their heads.
What an honor it was to stand with these trailblazing leaders.

It's time to bring this shutdown to an end immediately.
Air traffic controllers came to my office and warned me about this very possibility yesterday. I took to the floor to share their story.
�RT!� With many families facing financial uncertainty due to the shutdown, it's important to know where you can turn if you need assistance with your utilities, student loans, food, or health care. If you've been impacted by the shutdown click here ️️
No federal worker or struggling family should be forced to go without their basic needs. I will continue to work diligently on their behalf to end this #shutdown and bring stability to Delaware families.
Families are hurting through no fault of their own. They don't know when the government will open or when their next paycheck will come. That's why I decided to donate my salary this month to service orgs supporting Delawareans impacted by the #shutdown.
RT @ChrisCoons: Celebrating #MLKDay with @RepLBR and Dr. Wilma Mishoe from @DelStateUniv - two inspiring Delaware leaders!
Dr. King tells us that "of all forms of inequality, injustice in health is the most shocking and inhumane." That's why I was excited to join @BayhealthDE for the opening of their Sussex Campus in Milford that will make real strides in improving access to care in Sussex County.
It is an honor to join the talented and powerful women of the 116th Congress in today's special edition of the @nytimes. Together, we have the opportunity to make meaningful strides in improving our health care, combating climate change, and building a fairer economy.
On this day, we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 90th birthday. His courage in the face of intolerance forever moved our nation toward justice and equality. Today, I reflect on his teachings and am reminded that "Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that." #MLK90

Today the �2018 Farm Bill� was signed into law -- a hard-fought accomplishment and a meaningful step forward for Delaware farmers and families alike. To read my full statement, click here:
This is a big deal because the bill corrects coastal barrier maps so that homeowners like those in the South Shore Marina Community can access flood insurance and FEMA aid in the event of a disaster, while also protecting valuable coastal wetlands and wildlife – a real win-win.
Late last night, the Strengthening Coastal Communities Act, a bill I've been working on with @SenatorCarper and Senator @ChrisCoons, passed its final hurdle in the Senate and will be sent to the President’s desk for signature.

As former Delaware Deputy Secretary of Health and Social Services and a supporter of strong federal funding for the Title X program, it’s imperative that we continue to give family planning clinics the tools they need and remove the barriers women face in accessing contraception.
Highlighting Delaware’s innovative work, the @nytimes recently featured the strides our state is making in improving access to birth control and reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies at Title X family planning clinics.
As the nation’s dedicated source of funding for family planning, Title X helps health centers in Delaware and across the country provide low or no cost contraceptives to women and their families so they can take full control of their reproductive health.
At 6pm, I'll be joining the @usafmc and my colleagues @RodneyDavis, @RepMullin, @RepJoeKennedy for a conversation about improving civic engagement and finding common ground as we look to move our nation forward. Watch here:

By voting yes, Senate Republicans are sending a message to women everywhere that their experiences and their truths are less than. It’s the wrong message to send to anyone who comes forward and speaks truth to power.
I know that as women watched Dr. Ford’s powerful testimony that they didn’t just see Dr. Ford, they saw themselves, a friend, a family member. I #BelieveSurvivors and Senate Republicans must as well.
Like millions of women across this nation, Dr. Ford’s pain cut right to the core for so many who live in silence afraid to speak about the trauma they experienced. Her courage was inspiring and that’s why I’m here today.
Today, I joined my colleagues stood in solidarity with Dr. Blasey Ford. I believe her, we need to #BelieveSurviviors when they come forward with accounts of sexual harassment or assault. We need a FBI investigation into allegations against #Kavanaugh before any vote occurs.
