H.R. 1 is a terrible bill and threat to America's election system. I spoke on the House floor to voice my strong opposition to this legislation. Watch:

(5/5) This bill is not for the people, but rather, is full of self-serving policies that only benefit the politicians who authored it. H.R. 1 says a lot about the priorities of Democrat leadership this Congress – themselves.
(4/5) It weakens election security, promotes shady practices like ballot harvesting, further weakens voter ID laws, impedes free speech, and gives convicted felons the right to vote. None of these things are a good idea – even the ACLU says this bill is unconstitutional.
(3/5) Now, Under Democrat leadership, H.R. 1 is a bill designed to re-elect more Democrats to Congress using billions of taxpayer dollars.
(2/5) Last Congress, H.R. 1 was the #TaxCutsandJobsAct, which allowed American taxpayers to keep more of their hard-earned money where it belongs – in their pockets. In 1995, it was the Congressional Accountability Act to bring more transparency and oversight to Congress.
(1/5) Today, House Democrats passed H.R. 1, and I opposed this partisan legislation that would endanger our election

Democrats also rejected my amendment to the bill which would ban the practice of ballot harvesting, which is currently legal in California, but significantly erodes trust in the integrity of our election process. Instead, H.R. 1 aims to make this shady practice legal nation-wide.
This legislation is not for the people, it's for Democrat politicians. #NOTforthePeopleAct See for yourself - here are the top 10 most egregious provisions of H.R.1:
H.R.1 is dubbed the "For the People Act," but it couldn't be more inappropriately named. It forces taxpayers to fund political campaigns they may not agree with, endangers our election system, gives felons the right to vote. #NOTforthePeopleAct
Thank you, President Trump, for taking action to give our nation's veterans the support that they unquestionably deserve. Every veteran should feel that the nation is 100% behind them, and the President is backing that up.

Yesterday, Democrats passed H.R. 8. Today, they passed H.R. 1112. Both claim to make Americans safer from gun violence, but in reality, both only infringe upon the rights of law-abiding citizens. Criminals don't follow laws in the first place. The Senate must reject these bills.
I'm proud to be an original co-sponsor of @RepByrne, @SenTedCruz, @BetsyDeVosED's Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act. Every student and their parents deserve the freedom to select the best education opportunities that's best for them.
We cannot allow California’s radical gun laws to be imposed upon all Americans.
None of the major shootings recently in this country would have been prevented by these laws. This legislation is a farce that would only make life more difficult for honest Americans and jeopardize their safety – while not so much as inconveniencing real criminals.
By definition, criminals do not comply with the law. So what makes my Democrat colleagues think tightening background checks on law-abiding Americans will decrease gun violence? Criminals get their guns from the black market, the so-called dark web, or by other illicit means.
Today, I opposed H.R. 8, which was a partisan bill that would infringe upon our #SecondAmendment rights as Americans.

#ICYMI: The President declared a National Emergency at the southern border. I spoke with @KRCR7 over the weekend to reassure wildfire victims that money for the border wall will not be taken from wildfire relief funds.
(4/4) The situation at the southern border is a humanitarian and national security crisis, and it’s a national emergency. The stubborn opposition to a regulated border is incomprehensible and endangers American citizens.
(3/4) I’ve been working with the White House to ensure funding for disaster recovery and critical civil works projects, such as levees and water storage, are not affected by a shift in funding in this process.
(2/4) This decision is not without precedent – there have been nearly 60 national emergencies declared by U.S. Presidents since 1976. Similarly, previous governors of New Mexico and Arizona have also declared states of emergency along the border in the past.
(1/4) I support the President’s decision today to use the powers of the Executive to secure our southern border. I would have preferred to accomplish this legislatively, but the intractability of Democrat leadership to adequately address this issue has made that impossible.

Important news for #CampFire recovery: FEMA has extended the deadline to register for disaster assistance to January 31, 2019.
@POTUS has issued the challenge tonight with a comprehensive plan. There are no excuses not to debate and legislate one accordingly. #SecureOurBorder
Their unwillingness to negotiate speaks volumes about their priorities to defy a President the overwhelming number of Americans that want solutions, not gridlock.
In San Diego, illegal traffic has dropped 92% since a barrier was built in 1992. Democrats do have some history of supporting physical barriers at the southern border. What has changed? They seem only to oppose it now to impede this President.
The status quo is dangerous and is inflicting harm on real people and real families. Walls work – in sections of the southern border where a physical barrier is already present, we’ve seen a marked decrease in illegal immigration.
Over the last two months, we’ve seen an 86% increase in the amount of illegal immigrants apprehended by Border Patrol agents compared to the same period last year.
President Trump is right – the situation at our southern border is a humanitarian national security crisis. #SecureOurBorder

#TaxReform
I hope that we can get to work finding a solution to reopen those closed portions of the government that includes important disaster funding and border security which is desperately needed. Unfortunately, the bill today lacks both.
It has been clear for weeks that in order for a funding bill to pass the House, the Senate, and be signed by the President it will need to be a compromise. The Senate has said they won’t consider this bill and the President has said he would veto this bill.
The funding bill passed by Democrats tonight wasn’t a serious attempt to reopen the government, but the beginning of a stunt that takes time away from finding a solution.
(4/4) I’m optimistic that the House, Senate, and the President can all work together to further legislation that will meaningfully benefit the American people, and I’ll ensure the North State’s voice is heard loud and clear. Now, it’s time to get to work.
