I'm unapologetically anti illegal immigration pro legal immigration. It would be great if Cuomo found an ounce of integrity to admit he's pro illegal immigration rather than conflating it all simply saying he is pro-immigration, which couldn't be more deliberately misleading.
There are hard working, middle income NY taxpayers who can't afford to send their child to college, bc they don't qualify for free tuition $. If you want to expand aid to more college students then expand it for students who are in our country legally, not illegally.
Gov. Cuomo's blatant pandering to the extreme left of Dem Party utter disregard for the rule of law is becoming more more evident by the day. The guy has gone full Rambo prioritizing his fight for people who break laws over those who follow them.

50 yrs ago today, Medal of Honor recipient PFC Garfield Langhorn of Riverhead gave what Pres. Lincoln referred to as “the last full measure of devotion” in Vietnam as he threw himself on a grenade to save the lives of his platoon mates. A courageous act of a selfless hero.
This is nuts! The House will be out of session from the 17th to 28th. I say let's keep ALL Members of Congress in DC to negotiate w each other and @realDonaldTrump until there is deal. Lock us all in a room here...no phones...no pay...and this will end very quickly.

As I think about my Dem colleagues watching Hamilton right now in PR, hanging later w the cast in between beach time at their luxury resort, I'm thinking its time to lock all Members of Congress in a room in DC w no pay or phones until a deal is reached there is white smoke.
I voted to ensure fed employees affected by the partial gov't shutdown receive backpay, providing certainty for them their families was one of the 1st to instruct the House to withhold my pay until the shutdown is over in solidarity w fed workers

Today is National Human Trafficking Awareness Day. The Global Slavery Index says there were approximately 403k Americans in modern slavery in '18. One child subjected to these horrors is too many. This is also a great reminder of why we must strengthen ways ppl enter the US.
Dissolving a committee entirely focused on fighting terror, pursuing non-proliferation improving trade couldn't make any less sense. We are 1 nation, not 2 today's anti-Trump hate is raging dangerously away from what's best for the
American exceptionalism is nothing to ever apologize for. Was on @FoxNews @AmericaNewsroom w @BillHemmer this AM to discuss @SecPompeo's visit to Middle East this week U.S. foreign

This partial gov’t shutdown could end tomorrow. Hating the President fearing he gets a “win” are not acceptable reasons for blocking this from getting over the top. Negotiate. Compromise. I could care less about the credit. Let’s just get this done!
All Members of Congress must reject the labels and ideology of white supremacy and white nationalism. These terms and others like them are much more than words. These are beliefs that have victimized lives, societies and nations and will never have any place in our great nation.
Professor Acosta teaching his students a lesson on "How to successfully make the exact opposite point of what is intended."
Dems were unwilling to negotiate w POTUS before during gov’t shutdown. Now Pelosi admitted she also won’t negotiate AFTER the partial gov’t shutdown. I get it. They hate POTUS, but they must take to heart the pleas of law enforcement victim families, do their job negotiate.
Arms trafficking, sex trafficking, human trafficking, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, transnational gangs like MS-13. This is the moment of truth...if my Dem colleagues are serious re tackling these issues more then negotiate w/POTUS ASAP. No excuses. Let's get it done!
I fully support the President's request for increased border security funding. Let's get this done...THIS WEEK! This partial gov't shutdown could be over in just a few hours. America wins!!
I support increased border security to help stop illegal immigration, transnational gangs, the heroin opioid abuse crisis drug/sex/human trafficking. To my Dem colleagues, it’s time to negotiate compromise. There’s a GREAT deal to be had it can/must be done quickly!
The best way to end the partial gov't shutdown is for Dems to negotiate compromise on the need for increased border security funding. They are acting as if they have absolute power. Neither party does. This shutdown can end today. Negotiate compromise. It's a beautiful thing.
The BDS movement hasn't been about promoting free speech. It's involved straight up hate speech blatant anti-Semitism (oftentimes paid for through shady foreign entities); including US students discriminated against at colleges by their professors others.
That’s pretty rich that someone who literally wore a Palestinian flag at her victory party is lecturing about dual loyalty.
Great to join @NorthportVAMC local vets in Riverhead to announce greater services for East End vets at the community based outpatient clinic(CBOC) there. Expanding vets access to treatment w/out traveling to Northport's main campus makes a big difference in their everyday lives
Negotiate. Legislate. Compromise. Repeat. It's your job the true moral imperative here. Everyone knows this isn't actually about financial cost. It's about preventing the President from "having a win". Get over it negotiate, legislate, compromise then on to the next issue.
The moral imperative is to do your job regardless of whether you fearit will give the President a "win". I'll be on the @SeanHannity RadioShow at 4:30pm EST to discuss the partial govt shutdown need forDems to negotiate compromise on border security $. #Hannity
100 years ago today, Long Islander Teddy Roosevelt died; Nobel Peace Prize winner, Medal of Honor recipient U.S. President. A most impressive legacy of service that will be forever remembered respected.
Let’s be honest re this negotiation between POTUS Dems on border security $. The only acceptable compromise for Dems now is to get 100% of what they demand while POTUS is clearly willing to accept many different options. POTUS remains in DC while Dem leadership again left town.

Day 2 update: Rep Tlaib declares “We’re going to go in impeach the motherf****r”, Rep Ocasio-Cortez calls for 70% income tax, Dems still won’t negotiate on border security $ debt limit now automatically increases w out separate vote.
It's an incredible honor to represent the great, hardworking Long Islanders of NY-1 yesterday, joined by family and friends, I was honored to be sworn in for my 3rd term in Congress. #116thCongress
3 patriots who bleed red, white blue
The 116th Congress starts today Rep Johnson comparing Pres Trump to Hitler, Rep Sherman filing Articles of Impeachment against POTUS, Pelosi becoming Speaker, Dems refusing to negotiate on border $ 1st vote is to create auto increases to debt limit w/out voting on it.
Wishing you your loved ones a happy safe #NewYearsEve...and the very best in 2019!
For 4 consecutive years, it's been an honor to spend Christmas w/ U.S. troops deployed overseas, thank them for their service, serve them Christmas meals make sure they know how much every American at home appreciates them is immensely grateful for their sacrifice.
RT @AuschwitzMuseum: French Resistance hero Georges Loinger who saved hundreds of Jewish children dies aged 108
Spending Christmas away from their families isn’t easy for many of our troops this isn’t the 1st holiday deployed. It was an honor to be able to spend Christmas with them in the Middle East again to thank them for their service let them know how much they are appreciated.
#MerryChristmas from the Middle East! It’s been an honor to visit our troops here every Christmas I’ve been in Congress. Here are some of my favorite pics from past Christmas CODELs I’ve led to Iraq Afghanistan. From my family to yours, have a blessed and safe holiday.
Sen Schumer says House passed $$ bill is DOA in Senate. Pres Trump says Senate passed $$ bill is DOA at WH. The answer isn't to hang out in our corners just message to the base. The answer is to talk to each other, negotiate compromise. I was on @CNN earlier to discuss.
