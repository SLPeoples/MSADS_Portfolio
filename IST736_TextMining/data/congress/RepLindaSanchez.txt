Just voted with a bipartisan majority to terminate @POTUS’s #fakeemergency.
As a mother, I am shocked and repulsed by these findings. No child should ever be be subjected to this, especially not while in custody of the U.S. government. There needs to be a full investigation into this matter and those who are responsible need to be held accountable.
The right to vote is one of the most fundamental and hard-won rights in our democracy. That is why I’m proud to cosponsor legislation that protects this right for all Americans. #RestoreTheVOTE

I’m proud to support @JoaquinCastrotx’s Joint Resolution terminating President Trump’s national emergency declaration to build his wall along our southern border.
While the president may not like to play by the rules, his attempt to circumvent Congress by declaring a #FakeEmergency is a clear abuse of power and sets a dangerous precedent.
After shutting the government down for 35 days and causing more than 800k workers to go unpaid, the great negotiator @realDonaldTrump decided to declare an unlawful national emergency to fund his border wall.
On this anniversary of Japanese internment, we remember the injustices that occurred to our fellow citizens as a result of fear and hysteria. Let’s recommit ourselves to standing up against intolerance and prejudice in all its forms.
