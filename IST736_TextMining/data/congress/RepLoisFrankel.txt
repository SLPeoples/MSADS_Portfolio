This bipartisan bill, co-led by @RepSteveChabot @USRepKeating @RepJoeWilson @RepLeeZeldin @RepSpanberger, focuses on women's roles as victims, perpetrators, and preventers of violent extremism encourages full participation of women in our efforts to defeat this global threat
Women are often the first victims of violent extremism as mothers wives, they are on the frontlines of detecting radicalization countering terrorism. So on #InternationalWomensDay I'm proud to introduce the Women Countering Violent Extremism

My heart goes out to the victim who was injured and all those affected by last night’s shooting at the VA Medical Center in Riviera Beach. Read my full statement with the Palm Beach Congressional Delegation here:
In 2015, the #CharlestonLoophole allowed someone w/ a criminal history to buy a gun -- even though his background check wasn't completed. He then used that weapon to murder 9 worshipers at bible study at the Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC. We must fix our broken system.
The #CohenTestimony underscores that there is much more we need to learn about the potential crimes, cover-ups, ethical violations, conflicts of interests of this president. @OversightDems are getting to the truth - #ForThePeople.
If we don’t do something about #climatechange, extreme weather will have an impact on every Floridian. On our public health, our agriculture, our unique environment wildlife. We have to do something – before it’s too late.

Last year #antisemitic incidents in the US rose by 57% - the largest increase on record. And this is happening all over the globe. We have to call out hatred when we see it and all come together to stop it. #SOTU

I'm honored to be appointed to the powerful Appropriations Committee. This is an extraordinary opportunity to advocate for Floridians at the highest level of government, advancing investments in health care, education, infrastructure global peace.
Floridians depend on @USCG to protect our 800+ miles of coastline. The #TrumpShutdown is hurting these who protect our nat'l security maritime safety. They deserve to be paid on time - @POTUS, give up the temper tantrum re-open the gov't!
My thoughts go out to my friend and colleague @RepHastingsFL his family at this time. Wishing you strength for this fight ahead a full recovery.
Women in Congress have come so far today we stand 131 strong. Proud to work alongside these women in the most diverse Congress
This is welcome news: No one, including employers certainly not @POTUS) should interfere in women's personal health care decisions. We won't stop fighting until these harmful #BirthControl rules are scrapped for good!
Remember when @POTUS said he was “proud” to shutdown the government?Well, he got his wish. The #TrumpShutdown is now the longest in our history, families across the country are feeling the impact. Mr. Trump, it’s time to stop holding them hostage reopen the government!

I’m hearing from my constituents that the #TrumpShutdown is hurting American families in so many different ways. One Floridian hasn’t been able to apply for a job get back to work because E-Verify is down! #ShutdownStory

Today, on #HumanTraffickingAwareness Day, let’s remember the 40 million people worldwide who are victims of this modern day slavery. I’ll continue to support legislation in Congress to end this tragic exploitation #EndHumanTrafficking.
The #TrumpShutdown is not only robbing 800k workers of their paycheck, it's also putting public safety at risk. From air travel to foodborne illnesses, his temper tantrum over the wall is harming American families. Mr. Trump, it’s time to #EndTheShutdown!
The President shouldn’t be able to manufacture a national emergency during a #shutdown all to build his immoral, wasteful wall. Proud to be an original co-sponsor of @RepGraceMeng’s legislation to stop this overreach.
White supremacy has no place in America – and certainly not in the halls of Congress. Any comments suggesting that white supremacy is not offensive and dangerous are entirely unacceptable harmful to all Americans.
Even one day was too long to shut down the government. But 20 days!? This #TrumpShutdown is a national embarrassment. @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP – it’s time to #EndTheShutdown!
100 days since #SaudiArabia killed US resident @washingtonpost journalist Jamal Khashoggi. By failing to take action, Trump has again abandoned our moral leadership. We must prioritize human rights in our foreign policy and protect free speech those who speak truth to power.
Not only is the #TrumpShutdown keeping paychecks from working Floridians, it's putting the safety of sexual assault survivors at risk. 28 counseling crisis intervention groups will lose $$ starting tmrw, w/ potential cuts to staff services. @POTUS, end this now!
It’s time to clean up corruption in Washington, fight big money in politics and make it easier, not harder, to vote – that’s why I’m proud join my @HouseDemocrats colleagues in supporting the #ForThePeople Act. Let’s get it done.
People come from all over the world to visit #SouthFlorida, that wouldn’t be possible without the men and women working hard to keep our air travel safe orderly. @POTUS must stop holding their paychecks hostage reopen the government! #TrumpShutdown

BREAKING: today we took a big step towards empowering more women girls around the world by signing the #WEEEAct into law. When are educated, free from violence, have access to tools to support their families, their communities are safer, stronger, more peaceful.
Overthrowing the #ACA would send our country back to a time when being a woman was a pre-existing condition. I’m fighting back with @HouseDemocrats against #GOP efforts to dismantle the care you’ve come to count on. #ProtectOurCare
