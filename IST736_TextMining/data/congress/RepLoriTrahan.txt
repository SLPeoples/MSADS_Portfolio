This tragedy devastated our whole community. As a mother, this loss still fills me with grief and anger. Today, Jody keeps her daughter’s memory alive, educates women about domestic violence, and fights for tougher gun laws.
Today I spoke on the floor about Jody Marchand from my district. Jody endured years of domestic abuse. In 2010 she survived a brutal  attack by her husband, but lost her beautiful 17-year-old daughter, Olivia, when her husband shot and killed her, and then himself.

In fact, #EqualPayForEqualWork could slash the poverty rate for all working women in half (from 8.1 percent to 3.9 percent) and the poverty rate for working single mothers would be cut by nearly half (from 28.7 percent to 15.0 percent).
The gender pay gap doesn't just affect women – it affects children and families and our economy as a whole.Did you know that women are the sole or co-breadwinner in half of US families with children? Providing equal pay to women would have a dramatic impact on their families.
Today, a woman still makes only 80 cents, on average, for every dollar earned by her white male counterpart. That gap is even worse for women of color.I'm proud to have voted with @HouseDemocrats on the Education and Labor Committee to do something about it. #HR7 #EqualPay

No person should have to decide between putting food on the table or being able to care for a sick loved one.
One of the main reasons I ran for office was to make life better for women and hardworking families just like the one I grew up in. Ushering in a new, national paid family leave policy for the United States is one of the most significant steps Congress can take to do just that.
Family #PaidLeave legislation would empower women, strengthen families, support businesses, and grow the U.S. economy. I am proud to be a cosponsor, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill signed into law.
Can you imagine being forced to choose between putting food on the table or taking care of a sick loved one? No one should have to think about it, let alone experience it. That is why I am a cosponsor of the #FAMILYAct. It is time for a national #PaidLeave policy that works.
