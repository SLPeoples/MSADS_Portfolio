Many of the proposals in the #GreenNewDeal run counter to our foundational principles, and the costs alone make it highly impractical.
Great to visit and speak with the @GHCC_news at their breakfast in Atlanta yesterday!
HR 1, a bill that is nothing less than a federal takeover of our elections, is being pushed through the House. It would disenfranchise voters, cost billions, and strip state legislatures who have set standards to ensure free and fair elections.

In his State of the Union address, President Trump characterized the recent late-term abortion decisions quiet well. Congress should immediately pass legislation that would prohibit this vile and inhumane act on unborn children.
While I support President Trump’s efforts to provide adequate security on our southern border, I could not vote in support of this package of bills, due in part to not being given adequate time to review it.

While we will never agree on every issue, it is time for our nation to come together and recognize the bond we share as Americans. #SOTU #AmericaFirst
This year, .@POTUS and @GOP are focused on bipartisan solutions to rebuild America’s deteriorating infrastructure, lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, and protect America’s national security.  #SOTU
.@POTUS and @GOP have offered compromise, but the other side needs to be willing to negotiate on issues such as immigration reform. #SOTU
Under .@POTUS, the United States has brought North Korea to the negotiating table, withdrawn the U.S. from the flawed Iran Deal, and told our NATO partners to pay their fair share. #SOTU
.@SpeakerPelosi’s idea of compromise is, give me everything I want and you get nothing, then I blame you for getting nothing done. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
Meanwhile, .@SpeakerPelosi and @Democrats refuse to even negotiate. They are advocating for open borders and, last year, they tried to abolish ICE. Some even want to give illegal immigrants the right to vote. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
.@realDonaldTrump and @GOP want to secure our southern border by investing in personnel, advanced technology, and physical barriers. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
A migrant caravan of 2,000 people reached our border yesterday. It’s time for .@SpeakerPelosi and @Democrats to admit the truth that physical barriers will protect Americans. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
We must build physical barriers to stop the flow of human trafficking, sex trafficking, drugs, and weapons from pouring into our communities. #SOTU #KeepAmericaSafe
During the past two years, House Republicans have focused on making our communities safer, passing legislation aimed at combating the opioid crisis and investing in new resources for mental health, training, and school safety programs. #SOTU

Throughout 2018 Women’s unemployment rate reached a 65-year low; Veterans unemployment rate reached an 18-year low; and Youth unemployment rate reached a 48-year low. #SOTU
Since .@realDonaldTrump took office, more than 5.3 million jobs have been created, and we now even have record low unemployment rates for African-Americans, Asians, and Hispanics. #SOTU
...and appropriated funds to procure, replace, and upgrade platforms, weapons, and equipment to maintain military superiority. #SOTU

The problem at our southern border is a humanitarian one. A physical barrier, border patrol, and surveillance technology will significantly discourage migrants from making this dangerous, sometimes deadly journey. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst
In 2017 and 2018, 30,000 illegal immigrants were arrested in the interior of the U.S. for sex crimes, and 4,000 for homicides. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst
The numbers below indicate that boots on the ground and surveillance technology are not enough to combat the crisis at our southern border. We also need a physical barrier. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst
We need a physical deterrent at our southern border, so the 1 in 3 women who are sexually assaulted on the journey northward, don’t attempt the dangerous trek. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst
The sheer increase of illegal drugs pouring into the U.S. only reaffirms our need for more security, including a border wall. #BuildtheWall #AmericaFirst
