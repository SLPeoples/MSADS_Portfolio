I’ve worked for #FairMaps since I helped lead the creation of the California Independent Redistricting Commission. Independent commissions make our politicians more accountable to you. They give communities with common interests a voice. We won a major victory. 2/2
I’m proud that #HR1 includes my Redistricting Reform Act!  We will require states to create independent commissions to draw congressional maps. Politicians should never again be allowed to pick and choose their voters. #ForThePeople 1/2
This week, I chaired the Energy and Mineral resources hearing to discuss Trump and @Interior’s latest activities related to energy production. The Administration is incentivizing oil and gas activities while safety and environmental standards are in decline.
I’m glad to see Paul Manafort will face justice for his crimes. However, the fact that his sentence was 15 years below the recommended guidelines is a reminder that our justice system contains deep inequalities that aren’t just.
The #EmpowerAct provides commonsense reforms to protect men and women from workplace harassment. We can end the culture of fear and silence. I’m proud to be a cosponsor.
On this #InternationalWomensDay, join me in pledging to work every day for true equality. We must empower, trust, and respect women everywhere.
This is a historic day. We’re passing sweeping legislation to make our democracy more truly democratic. We’re building a government that works for you. Together, we’re cracking down on dark money and corruption, confronting voter suppression, and working to end gerrymandering.
.@LeaderHoyer is exactly right. I led the Redistricting Reform Act with my colleagues, @RepBrownley and @RepZoeLofgren, and I couldn’t be prouder to see it pass the House in #HR1 today. #ForThePeople
When force is used in their name, the American people must understand the reasons and the purpose.  I strongly oppose the President’s decision to suspend reports on the impact of drone strikes by the CIA in Yemen, Pakistan, Libya and Somalia.
The American people want their federal government to be honest, and responsive. HR1 is about putting power back in the hands of voters and citizens, rather than special interests.
Today is the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday in Selma. Courageous activists, including @RepJohnLewis, risked everything for equality, and for the right to vote. We must remember their sacrifice and carry on their struggle.
Proud to join my great friends @Rosa_DeLauro  and @RepDelBene to introduce the American Family Act—legislation that will more than triple the Child Tax Credit for families with young children. After the GOP Tax Scam, we're working for a fairer tax code for working families.
The Senate will reject the President’s #FakeEmergency, as it should. His emergency declaration is an abuse of power, and is not justified by the facts on the ground.
This is the constitutionally-authorized oversight that @GOP refused to perform, even as more and more scandals involving the President surfaced. The American people deserve to know the truth.
We must pass HR1. We have an opportunity to restore voting rights, confront gerrymandering, and tackle the corrosive influence of dark money in politics. We can take real action to end corruption. We’re delivering #ForThePeople

There can be no more doubt, and no more excuses for inaction or delay. The planet can’t wait. It’s time to #ActOnClimate – I’m proud to support the Green New Deal.
Michael Cohen’s testimony was dramatic— and raises further questions. We must continue to call witnesses and conduct investigations. We need other Trump organization officials to testify. We need the President’s tax returns.
ICYM: This week I joined bipartisan partners to fight for democracy and human rights by introducing the Cambodia Trade Act. When we fail to provide a voice for oppressed people around the world, we badly weaken our global leadership.
This week Congress passed sweeping bills to confront gun violence, preserve public lands, and to protect our Constitution from the President’s #FakeEmergency. We conducted aggressive oversight of Trump administration corruption. The Congress is finally working #ForThePeople.
The President’s abuse of power to grant clearances to his family members threatens our national security. We need answers. We cannot allow the Trump family’s hidden financial dealings to jeopardize our country’s security. 
I applaud this effort to uncover wrongdoing by the Trump inaugural committee. We need hard facts, and hard documents. The American people need transparency from the President.
Healthcare is a human right. No one should face bankruptcy or worse because they get sick. I’m proud to support @RepJayapal as a cosponsor of the #MedicareforAll Act.
I had the opportunity to join my congressional colleagues this week at the @HolocaustMuseum. A profound and moving reminder of the risks of xenophobia, racism and Anti-Semitism, and of the need for constant vigilance.
Last night we passed #HR8 to require universal background checks. Today, we passed #HR1112 to end the Charleston Loophole that enabled the tragic Emanuel AME Church Shooting in 2015. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. Change is coming.
I am disappointed by President Trump’s failure to secure an agreement with North Korea. In spite of our differences, we can unite in the pursuit of peace and diplomacy.
Reports of escalating tension between India and Pakistan are extremely disturbing. We cannot risk nuclear conflict. I appeal to both side to seek a diplomatic solution as soon as possible. This is no time for irresponsible posturing.
The gun violence epidemic is a national tragedy. At long last, Congress has voted to confront it. I couldn’t be prouder to have voted to pass universal background checks, and to pass #HR8 today. We can save lives. It’s time to #EndGunViolence.
Leader McConnell is hiding behind parliamentary maneuvers to prolong the illegal and immoral war in Yemen. This is unacceptable.
Michael Cohen’s revelations are a reminder of the depths of corruption surrounding the President and his private businesses. His testimony underscores the need for hard facts: we need the President’s tax returns, and we need the full Special Counsel report!
The Trump Administration continues to put special interests and fossil fuel companies first, waiving safety regulations on thousands of offshore drilling platforms. With my @NRDems colleagues, I’m demanding answers.

Today I’m proud to introduce the bipartisan, bicameral Cambodia Trade Act. Cambodia cannot continue to benefit from preferential trade agreements without accountability if they continue to undermine human rights and democracy. My statement:
I am shocked and disappointed by Prime Minister Netanhayu’s decision to align himself with far right extremists ahead of the upcoming elections. This decision is a blow to peace and human rights.
58 national security leaders from both parties have asserted that the facts on the ground at the border do not justify an emergency declaration—as the President himself has admitted! Congress and the courts will hold him accountable.
When it comes to the President and Deutsche Bank, the American people deserve transparency and accountability.
This week, the House will vote to terminate President Trump’s #FakeEmergency. We will not allow the President to disregard the Constitution and the will of the American people. I call on my @GOP colleagues to do the right thing and to join us.
No one should face discrimination for who they are. I proudly joined 95 of my congressional colleagues to protest an outrageous move by HHS to allow publicly funded foster care agencies to discriminate on the basis of religion.
Gerrymandering is wrong, no matter what party is responsible. It fosters extremism, divides communities, and distorts our democracy. I’m proud to support HR 1 and its push for #FairMaps!
Medicare for all is about justice—about making sure that no American faces financial ruin because of healthcare costs—and about building a healthcare system that works for everyone.
Climate change is a global problem that requires an international solution. The Trump Administration set us back years with their reckless withdrawal from the Paris Agreement—but we must continue to build multilateral support for action! #ActOnClimate
I’m proud to revieve a perfect score from @NETWORKLobby for my record to fight inequality and advance social justice for all.
Last week, my favorite bird, and the world’s oldest wild bird, gave birth to another chick at the young age of 68! My bill, the Albatross and Petrel Conservation Act will help protect these important, and threatened, seabirds!
Last week @RepBrianFitz and I reintroduced our Albatross and Petrel Conservation Act. The US must do our part in protecting these threatened birds by implementing and enforcing the international Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels.
The President’s reckless action on trade has real consequences for hardworking Americans. When our country acts on trade, we must act responsibly and strategically to protect our workers, our environment, and our businesses—this isn’t a game.

Last week the House of Representatives took historic action to assert control over our foreign policy, and to ensure that our nation lives up to the promise of its ideals. The War in Yemen is unjust and immoral. Our involvement must end.

I am excited that the Coastal Commission unanimously approved the improvement plan for the Colorado Lagoon in east Long Beach! I have am a strong advocate for the continued restoration and preservation of the Colorado
A week ago today, I chaired the first hearing of the House Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. We’re acting deliberately and carefully to build a bridge to a clean-energy economy. The stakes are too high to wait! We must act on climate.
In honor of President’s Day, join me today in reflecting on our constitution, on the value of leadership, and on the promise of our democracy.
Hearings this week highlighted the rising challenge of climate change in our national parks. We see shrinking glaciers and rising sea levels, and we see devastating wildfires. The warning signs are all here, and the U.S. must take the lead to confront this crisis.
The Administration continues to deny #DREAMers the right to travel freely—this is unjust and unproductive. With @SenKamalaHarris and @SenFeinstein, I led a group of my House and Senate colleagues to take a stand for the rights of DACA recipients. 
The Trump EPA and Interior departments have consistently placed special interests, cronyism and irresponsible deregulation at all costs before their duty to preserve our environment and public health. @NRDems will hold them accountable.
ICYM: This week, the Senate passed the bipartisan WILD Act. This bill takes decisive action to protect wildlife endangered species around the world. Proud to join @repdonyoung in leading the companion bill in the House!
Today, President Trump declared a national emergency – though saying that he “didn’t need to do this.” There is no rational justification for this and Congress will do everything in its power to block this non-emergency declaration power grab! #FakeTrumpEmergency
A judge has found that Paul Manafort lied to the Special Counsel about ongoing contacts with a known Russian intelligence officer during his tenure as chairman of the Trump Campaign. We will continue to protect the Special Counsel—the American people deserve the the facts!
The American people elected us to do our jobs, and to ensure that the government remains open. Today’s funding package was not perfect, but it rejects the President's wall, and provides humanitarian aid to asylum seekers. It protects federal workers. I voted yes.
The President can't manufacture a crisis, and then try to solve it by  usurping Congress's power of the purse. This is an affront to the constitution and the rule of law.  We'll see him in court, and I have no doubt we'll win.
One year after the Parkland shooting, we still grieve. Like so many of the incredible survivors of that tragic day, we must all channel our sorrow into action. Change is coming: I couldn’t be prouder to see #HR8 moving forward. Our nation needs more than thoughts and prayers.

Today the House takes historic action to end American support for the morally outrageous and unacceptable Saudi campaign in Yemen. I am a proud original cosponsor of @RepRoKhanna’s War Powers resolution.
As WH drafts plans to raid money for disaster recovery in CA and PR, I’m working with @RepGaramendi to prevent diversion of these important funds:

Politically motivated violence against journalists is an affront to our democracy. I condemn this outrageous attack, and the ugly rhetoric that incited it, in the strongest possible terms.

I am proud to cosponsor this resolution. Its time to stand up for human rights and to work to end this endless violence.
Walter Jones was a remarkable person. He put principles before partisanship and provided a tireless voice for peace, for veterans, and for his constituents. He leaves a remarkable legacy, and we all owe him a great debt for his service.
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge should never have been opened to oil gas exploration. Shortsighted political deals place vulnerable ecosystems and communities in serious jeopardy—I’m proud to stand with my colleagues to fight to restore protections.
This week saw hearings on climate change and gun violence, and saw the Acting Attorney General questioned publicly about protecting the Mueller probe from political interference. Make no mistake: @HouseDemocrats are taking action. #ActOnClimate
Federal workers are STILL awaiting back pay following the #TrumpShutdown. This is utterly unacceptable, and a reminder of the harm caused by the President’s outrageous demands.
You can’t fight a forest fire with a garden hose, and we can’t stop imminent climate change without extraordinary measures. I’m a proud original cosponsor of the @AOC and @SenMarkey Green New Deal resolution.
Great to see @MayorOfLA testify this week before @TransportDems. I was able to ask him how we can ensure our investment benefits the communities with the greatest need for good, family-sustaining jobs.
The Saudi government is responsible for appalling human rights violations. The evidence is clear that Mohammed bin Salman was responsible for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Our country must demand accountability—including the suspension of arms sales.  
This week I was pleased to see the Senate Environment Public Works committee pass the companion to my WILD act, a bill to protected threatened species, combat, and promote conservation efforts. I’m going to lead this bill through the House with @RepDonYoung
Our country has lost a great legislator and public servant. John Dingell was an inspirational fighter for the American people.  My deepest condolences to @RepDebDingell and their entire family.
Mr. President, the American people voted for us to clean up Washington. That means investigating wrongdoing and passing laws to end corruption. That is what we intend to do.
Our roads, bridges, ports, and even our clean water infrastructure are aging rapidly. We need major investments to keep our economy growing for everyone—and to prepare for the impact of climate change. I was proud to join @TransportDems for a hearing today on #TheCostofInaction
Climate change is an extraordinary threat. It is time for an extraordinary response. Our nation can achieve incredible things when we act decisively— but we can’t afford to wait. I am proud to join @RepAOC and @SenMarkey in cosponsoring the Green New Deal Resolution today.

A wall wouldn’t do a single thing to change that fact. Neither will members of our military, who are in support and logistical roles only.  If we want to discuss border security, its time to face reality and stop this posturing. 2/2
This is ridiculous fearmongering. Asylum seekers aren’t hoping to “flood” the border—they want to claim asylum and plead for legal status. They have a legal right under American International law to have their cases reviewed here. 1/2
David Bernhardt’s work as an oil industry lobbyist should disqualify him from heading Interior Dept. His nomination by Trump is another blatant attack on our public lands and resources. House oversight will be needed to watch him closely.
These reports are deeply alarming. It’s clear that dangerous effects of climate change are already occurring—but there’s time for us to prevent the most serious impacts. We need to #ActOnClimate and we need to act now.
There is simply no “crisis” at the border that would justify an emergency declaration to overrule Congress and the will of the American people. The President must face facts and respect the rule of law.
106 years ago today, Rosa Parks was born. Her legacy remains as inspiring as ever. Join me in honoring her by committing to fight for justice for all every day. #BlackHistoryMonth
The Administration’s efforts to roll back title IX protections are disastrous for sexual assault survivors. We can’t afford to give up the hard-won and frustratingly slow progress we have made – I  was proud to submit comments to oppose this policy.
Congress is done ignoring the effects of climate change. We’re holding hearings and preparing legislation—and we want to hear how you have been affected directly. Share your stories with us:
This week will see the first real congressional hearings on gun violence in years. We allowed this unnecessary crisis to fester for years, as mass shooting after mass shooting added more and more victims. Enough. Action is coming.
The Trump EPA is appointing a climate change denier to a key scientific advisory board. Time and again we’ve seen them try to suppress or reshape the undeniable evidence that climate change is a man-made and existential threat.
The damage done to our national parks by the #TrumpShutdown could take centuries to heal. This is another tragic reminder—we must never allow a shutdown on this scale again.
This bullying and politicizing of the intelligence community hearkens back to some of the most disastrous blunders of American foreign policy, including the Iraq War. When a President makes foreign policy based on their preconceived biases, bad things happen.
The Iran deal made our country safer. Our intelligence chiefs contradicted the President to make that point in testimony this week. We owe our European allies a debt for continuing to uphold the agreement.
Climate change is here. We need to get serious about confronting its impact and limiting further damage.
Message to Leader McConnell: making election day a federal holiday  is no “power grab”—it’s an overwhelmingly popular idea to make working people’s voices heard more powerfully. HR 1 is about strengthening our democracy and fighting corruption. 
We’re willing to secure our border- investing in scanning equipment at ports of entry and increasing surveillance. But we won’t accept a pointless wall, and we won’t give in to hostage-taking. The President must know that he cannot shut down the government again.
We can’t undo the harm that the #TrumpShutdown caused to federal workers, but we can show them that the American people value their service, and help pay what they are worth. I’m that the house passed Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act.
The Administration consistently abandons its duty to protect public health, and clean water. This is only the latest example.
The U.S. should not be supporting Saudi Arabia’s bloody war in Yemen. I will proudly support a War Powers resolution. We must have accountability from Saudi Arabia, and constitutional oversight of foreign policy from Congress.

There is more to learn, and it is essential that we see the full results of the Special Counsel’s investigation. However, as yet another member of the President’s inner circle is jailed, it is clear that the President must answer for these very serious allegations 2/2

We know climate change will lead to increasing natural disasters, droughts and economic harm in the US—but is also means conflict, suffering and instability around the world. Climate action is a moral imperative—and a national security issue.
Today is Holocaust Remembrance Day. Join me in commemorating the suffering of millions of Jews and other innocent victims of Nazism. #WeRemember
The #TrumpShutdown was pointless and avoidable. The President chose to hold our country hostage to demand a wall that has been rejected by the American people, and that he claimed Mexico would pay for.
The White House security clearance process has been disastrously abused. We need to understand the full magnitude of the problem and whether our national security has been threatened. There must be consequences.
The Administration has continued its shameful efforts to deport Vietnam War era refugees from South East Asia. We’re working to end this shameful policy. #RefugeeResilience #KeepFamiliesTogether
My response to the end of the #TrumpShutdown :
Secretary Ross doesn’t understand the real world. The #Trumpshutdown has forced 800,000 to go without pay for over a month— and the Administration can’t comprehend the harm they’re causing to hardworking Americans.
My democratic colleagues and I have voted 11 times to end the shutdown. We have passed 10 bills. We can’t allow the President and Majority Leader McConnell to continue governing by hostage-taking— reopen the government!
Thrilled to rejoin the @TransportDems this Congress. I look forward to working to upgrade our ports and build robust, sustainable infrastructure projects with chairman, @RepPeterDeFazio. Excited to welcome my friend and neighbor from Orange County @RepHarley!

Today, 52 Senators voted to reopen the government, with no preconditions— more than voted for the President’s so-called wall deal. I thank the 6 republicans who put country before party and joined every Senate Democrat to vote to end the #TrumpShutdown
The #TrumpShutdown has real costs. All Americans  are affected, directly or indirectly. It must end now. Then, and only then, we can negotiate on border security.
The Trump administration has given special treatment to the oil gas industry behind closed doors for years. Watch now as I lead an effort with my @NRDems colleagues to spotlight blatant favoritism of oil gas companies throughout the #TrumpShutdown :
President Trump insists that we need a wall to fight crime—at the same time that he deprives the FBI of critical resources, and disrupts active investigations.
This is a tragedy. Healthcare is a human right. As a proud member of the Medicare for all Caucus, I’m fighting to make that right a reality.
Federal workers: resources are available to assist you during the shutdown. We’re working to reopen the government as soon as possible, passing over a dozen proposals to restore funding. Please contact my office if you need help finding resources.
We won’t legitimize political hostage-taking and allow the President to gut the legal asylum process. Government funding must come before a deal on border security!
Too many American families haven’t seen a real pay increase in decades. Tax cuts favoring the wealthy won’t fix that. I’m proud to cosponsor the Raise the Wage Act, which will put money into the pockets of millions of hardworking Americans.
I am profoundly disappointed by the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision to allow the Trump administration to temporarily implement its discriminatory Transgender military ban. Trans Americans have served our country capably for years, and deserve full equality. This is not over.
In honor of Martin Luther King Day, join me in pledging to fight to fulfill the promise of his legacy. We must work every day to build a more just and equal society.
My response to President Trump's statement:
The Family separation policy was instituted with malice and ineptitude. I saw the haunting impact of the policy when I toured border facilities—but there is much more we need to know. Congress will aggressively investigate.
Our parks and public lands should be helping to offset carbon emissions, but thanks to the Administration’s energy policies, they’re actually contributing to climate change. Check out my op-ed with @RepRaulGrijalva:
This week, Trump nominee Andrew Wheeler demonstrated himself to be unfit to lead the EPA. He continued to downplay climate change, and refused to abandon the reckless Trump deregulatory agenda, which has resulted in more pollution and worse health outcomes for thousands.
ICYM: This week,  I joined my colleagues @RepRaulGrijalva and @BettyMcCollum04 to demand that the administration stop ordering furloughed federal workers to return to work to serve the interests of oil gas companies, with shoddy legal justifications.
Forcing federal workers to work without pay under these conditions is profoundly unjust. There’s no way around this crisis, and no easy out. The #TrumpShutdown must end now!
The economic cost of the shutdown is increasing every day. 800,000 federal workers are suffering, but as payments freeze and government services stall, more and more Americans will feel the pain. We MUST reopen the government BEFORE any negotiations about the border.
If these reports are true, the President is in serious legal trouble. In conjunction with the Special Counsel, we will investigate and take all appropriate steps.
Cancelling Speaker Pelosi’s trip to meet with military officials in Afghanistan interferes with Congress’ constitutional oversight obligations, and harms our national security. It is yet another attempt to undermine the critical separation of powers.

This is an important legal victory. The Trump Administration sought to deliberately undercount immigrants and foster distrust in the census. It’s essential that the count be fair and legal- our democracy depends on it!
I applaud my GOP colleagues on this long-overdue measure to hold Steve King accountable for his appalling bigotry.
I’m proud to stand for #DREAMers. I’m hosting @AdvanceParole here in DC to fight to restore these young people’s right to travel freely. #DREAMers deserve better than to be left in a precarious legal limbo.
We can’t afford to recklessly foment war with Iran. These reports are deeply disturbing.
The American people overwhelmingly called for accountability in Washington. Investigations are coming: we’ll find the truth.
We need to end the shutdown now. I call on the Senate to swiftly take up the spending bills passed by the house—it’s clear that the President has no plan, and won’t negotiate in good faith.
Its easy to feel like you don’t have a voice in DC. Partisan gerrymandering distorts the electorate. Voters are disenfranchised. Dark money buys influence for the wealthiest. Special interests manipulate the process. Now, change is coming. I’m proud to cosponsor HR1.
So much about the #TrumpShutdown is devastating—the struggling families, the frozen vital government programs—but it’s worth recognizing the serious harm that the shutdown does to our precious national parks.
ICYM: This week, I introduced a resolution to call for an end to partisan gerrymandering once and for all. We can’t let politicians choose voters and divide communities when it suits their own ends— it fundamentally weakens our democracy.
Great to see this wonderful profile of Long Beach’s own community hero Zoe Nicholson. Her campaign for justice and equality is an inspiration.
This is alarming, and it underscores the obvious truth: we can’t afford to delay bold action to cut carbon emissions and confront climate change.
I sat down with @NATCA representatives this week. These hardworking men and women keep our country running—they deserve better.
California won’t be bullied.
I stand with federal workers. Public servants deserve our support and gratitude.
Proud to support this effort to #ProtectOurCare from the @GOP backed lawsuits to gut coverage for Americans with preexisting conditions. Health care is a human right—we can’t afford to move backwards.
800,000 Americans going unjustly without pay. Permits stalled. The TSA losing workers, who can’t be replaced. The #Trumpshutdown is costing our economy a billion dollars a week, and the President continues to hold our country hostage.
Honored to reintroduce a resolution today with @RepBrianFitz to make it the sense of Congress that congressional redistricting should be done to remove political gerrymandering! It is time to #endgerrymandering it is time for #fairmaps

The President shut down the government to demand “steel slats” that will leave our border impenetrable to anyone who can’t buy a saw (or, like most traffickers, travel through a port of entry). Enough. Reopen the government, and we can discuss real border security.
There’s less than a week before then end of open enrollment through Don’t miss out. Get coverage before the 1/15 deadline!
The President shut down the government without a plan, and without caring about the impact. Innocent people are paying the price for his recklessness.
It was an honor to join @GabbyGiffords this morning, as we reflected on the terrible impact of gun violence and celebrated her tireless work to end this scourge. I’m proud to support #HR8 and its push for universal background checks.
The president seems to have only one tactic: hold innocent Americans hostage, while demonizing anyone who disagrees with him. It is so outrageous that he can’t express empathy for those affected by the terrible fires in our state. This is a disgraceful lack of moral leadership.
