Today #HR8 passed the House, marking a pivotal moment in our fight to #EndGunViolence and to ensure the safety of every community across our nation.This is progress. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are making the safety of all Americans a priority.
Congress has the power and the duty to act and restore protections against racial discrimination in voting. We must act to #RestoreTheVote

I look forward to joining @ChrisMurphyCT as well as gun violence survivors and experts for a Town Hall TONIGHT at 7pm to discuss universal background checks.To watch live and submit your questions:  #BackgroundChecksNow
Thank you to our neighbors and members of the community who joined me this afternoon to discuss common-sense solutions to #EndGunViolence.I look forward to voting “YES” when #HR8 comes to the floor of the House this week.
The pain of losing a child to gun violence never goes away. I know – it's that pain which drives me every day in my work to prevent gun violence.Next week, we will take an important step as the House holds a vote on H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.

It was great to join the students at Lakeside High School during their #BlackHistoryMonth program. It energizes my fight in Washington to see students involved in democratic discourse.Thank you for sharing your day!
Happy birthday, @repjohnlewis! It is an honor to serve the state of Georgia with you. �
Today would have been Jordan’s 24th birthday.I am honoring my son’s life by working for common sense solutions to end gun violence and save as many lives as possible.Happy birthday, Jordan.#EndGunViolence
My heart is with the #Aurora community and the five families who now know the pain of losing a loved one to gun violence. I will continue to fight in Congress to #EndGunViolence and keep others from feeling the pain too many of us know too well.
As we wait for details from #Aurora, our thoughts are with all who are waiting for news about their loved ones, and we send our thanks to the first responders.But we know that we need more than thoughts and prayers to keep us safe. #EndGunViolence #EnoughIsEnough
I haven’t been here long, but I know that Congress – not the President – has the power of the purse.This #FakeEmergency declaration over a crisis that does not exist undermines our system of checks and balances and steals taxpayer funds that are meant to keep our nation safe.
Today, we remember the 17 students and staff members who were killed one year ago at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.We must take meaningful action to #EndGunViolence.#NeverAgain #MSDStrongToday

It’s past 7pm.In @HouseJudiciary we are still marking up #HR8 so that we can bring this historic gun violence prevention legislation to the floor of the House.@MomsDemand volunteers have been here since 10am.Their commitment to #EndGunViolence is inspiring.
I have been working with victims for six years. I have been working on this legislation for six years.I refuse to let anyone challenge this bill as legislation that is not germane to saving as many lives as we possibly can.#HR8 #EndGunViolence
It was my honor to preside over the Chamber as @RepTedDeutch led a moment of silence before reading the names of the 17 who were killed in the shooting at Stoneman Douglas HS in Parkland last year.I took the moment to reflect on where we are and where I want our nation to be.
I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of #HR8. Today, we are working in @HouseJudiciary to #EndGunViolence.The overwhelming bipartisan support for universal background checks symbolizes the power of advocacy the incredible power of survivors who share their stories.

Every day, journalists around the world - just like Ahmed - risk their lives to expose truth hold those in power accountable.Too many face intimidation violence for doing work that is vital to democracy.This piece highlights why we must stand up for global press freedom:
Today, and every day, I stand with gun violence survivors and advocates.On Wednesday, one day before the anniversary of Parkland, we will hold a markup in @HouseJudiciary on #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act.Together, we are #TakingAction to #EndGunViolence.
Today @HouseJudiciary held the first hearing on gun violence in nearly a decade.I shared the story of my son, Jordan, a victim of gun violence.Our stories are vitally important as we work to pass common-sense legislation to #EndGunViolence.Congress finally is #TakingAction.
Gun violence has touched far too many of us.Today, gun violence victims, survivors, and advocates gathered at the #SOTU19 to tell their stories and highlight the need for common-sense gun safety solutions.Our country must do better.#SOTU2EndGunViolence
Just three months ago, Jeff Margaret Binkley lost their beautiful daughter, Maura, in a shooting at a yoga studio in Tallahassee, Florida. These Dunwoody parents will join me in D.C. for the #SOTU2019 to tell Maura's story advocate for common-sense gun safety solutions.
Every #BlackHistoryMonth I have celebrated the accomplishments of those who have come before me. This one is particularly special, as I stand on the shoulders of giants and strive to make a pathway for those who will come after me.
Last night I talked with Mayor Joe Lockwood of @cityofmiltonga. I was honored to attend the State of the City, and look forward to many more great events in Milton!
I spoke on the House floor for the victims of gun violence that we don’t always talk about. The mothers, the fathers who have suffered tragic loss - the voices that we don’t always hear. We need policy, we need change, and we cannot wait any longer.
“I am now everything that I was fighting for in my son.” Listen to my full interview with @Lawrence on @TheLastWord to hear about how I fight for my district every day I am in Congress.
My father was President of the Illinois NAACP for over 20 years. I grew up in marches demanding more from our government. When it comes to voting rights, my daddy’s work is not yet done. Today @HouseJudiciary held our first hearing on #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.
Stay safe tonight! Fulton, Cobb, and DeKalb counties have cancelled school tomorrow. Be careful of ice, stay off the roads, and follow @NWSAtlanta for updates.
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay we remember the six million Jews and millions of others who were murdered during the Holocaust.We honor the lives of those who were killed and recommit to our moral obligation to speak out against injustice and evil in all forms. #NeverAgain
Thankful that federal workers and their families have some relief for now, but I’m disappointed that the Senate President upended lives held paychecks hostage 35 days.In 3 weeks, I hope those lawmakers place the needs wellbeing of the American people over petty politics.
Day 34 of the president's shutdown:Hundreds of thousands of federal workers tasked w/ keeping us safe are still working without pay.I'm deeply concerned for TSA agents air traffic controllers at Atlanta's airport, those working keep the public safe during the Super Bowl.
Telling your story is one of the most powerful actions you can take. As we work to reopen the government, I would be honored if you allowed me to tell your story of how the government shutdown has impacted you and your family. Tell me your story here
Today I prayed, marched, and spoke in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It is time we demand our leaders uphold his teachings through their actions and not just their words. Our communities, our state, and our nation depend on it.
The shutdown is hurting Americans here in Georgia and across the nation. Time and again, I have joined my colleagues in voting to reopen the government. We have done our job. It's time for the Senate and the President to do theirs.
I met with union members who don't know when their next paychecks will come. Bills don't stop because the government is shut down. 30 days into this shutdown and without a source of income, many men and women are struggling to make ends meet.
This weekend, I met with members of our community who are impacted by the government shutdown.Patti and her family were kind enough to welcome me into their home. They don't know when her next paycheck will come because she can't go back to work until this shutdown ends.
The @AMarch4OurLives students are an inspiration. I am proud to stand with them in the fight to keep our communities safe.
@jwitcraft It should be good to go now! Thank you for telling us your story!
I want to hear how the shutdown has impacted you and your family. Please share how you have personally been impacted by the government shutdown at the link
This weekend I was honored to join the Georgia Air National Guard in welcoming Brig. Gen. Thomas Grabowski into his new role. Our state is safer because of his leadership.
Happy Founders Day to all my Sorors of @dstinc1913. Here is to 106 years of service, and many more to come. #dst106
I wanted to represent my community in Washington so I could get to work for them, and that is exactly what I have done since day one.

@fred_guttenberg Thank you, Fred!
I have beaten breast cancer twice - I know how important it is that we fight to cover those with pre-existing conditions. That is why today I proudly voted to defend the #ACA, and to make it easier to get quality and affordable health insurance.
Federal employees, small business owners, and every taxpayer in this country deserve a government that works. That is why I voted today to allow families to receive their tax refunds on time, and to re-open the Small Business
Quite simply, background checks save lives.
The road to change is long, but with a lot of dedicated activists and legislators progress is possible. I am proud to stand with my colleagues in co-sponsoring H.R. 8, a bill which would implement universal background checks.
