Automatic voter registration. Federal holidays on election day so people can vote. Super PACs disclosing the sources of their money. These are no-brainers to strengthen our democracy restore power fully to the people, #ForThePeople. I was proud to vote in favor of HR1 today.
In honor of #IWD2019, @RepSchakowsky and I have intro'd a resolution calling on Congress to ratify #CEDAW, the most comprehensive international agreement on women's rights. Full statement here:
@justhaina @BenKallos @CarolynBMaloney my statement on this disgusting, anti-Semitic crime here:
@walkiotics I’ve intro’d the Never Again Education Act to support Holocaust education across the country and continue to speak out against any and all forms of anti-Semitism.
@idiot_girl @morethanmySLE couldn’t agree more. It’s one of the many reasons I continue to fight to #protectourcare.

I am saddened to hear that Asphalt Green has been defaced with swastikas. NYC is a place where diversity is celebrated, and I am disturbed by this hateful act in my community. We must eliminate anti-Semitism condemn all forms of bigotry and hatred.

As we mark #InternationalWomensDay, we must also recognize that in the United States, women's equality is still not yet enshrined in our Constitution. I think it's long past time we change that. We need to ratify the #ERAnow.

RT @JECDems: Full statement by JEC Vice Chair Carolyn Maloney @RepMaloney on the February #JobsReport.
For some, 9/11 is a distant memory. But, the sick injured first responders survivors remember with every breath, every cough, every doctor’s appointment. We made a promise to #NeverForget. They shouldn’t have to come begging for us to do our jobs. We need to #renew911vcf.
Mark your calendars! This Sunday at 1pm I will be discussing #NY12 updates, infrastructure investments in NYC, and my legislative work in DC at my State of the District presentation. Make sure to join me @Hunter_College in Lecture Room W714.
Drug overdoses are a crisis that we need to act on NOW. In 2017, there were 3,900 drug deaths in NY: 3,224 from opioids. 70K+ died nationwide.Inexcusable that Trump admin didn’t issue drug control strategy in first 2 yrs.Video from @OversightDems hearing:
@dimpNewYork @MTA Thanks for your interest in this. I agree it’s a big problem. Here’s a tweet from January I did on this. We need to keep up the pressure.

RT @JECDems: This year’s health care costs will be lower than previously projected – more evidence the ACA is working. h/t @econjared
Only 25% of NYC subway stations are currently accessible by elevator, making it extremely difficult often impossible for individuals with disabilities to travel safely. The @MTA must work to guarantee accessibility in all stations protect ALL riders.
We must reauthorize #VAWA. Its programs help millions of women, incl through the #DebbieSmith DNA backlog grant program, which was created by a bill I authored. No survivor should be denied justice bc their local police dept doesn’t have the resources to test their rape kit.
Women's rights are human rights, yet the @StateDept is expected to once again leave out #reprorights from its annual Human Rights Reports for the 2nd year. Passing the #ReproRightsAreHumanRights Act is how we'll to restore those rights to women this year in the future.

Since the repeal of #NetNeutrality, we’re seeing throttling streaming speeds, higher costs for HD, the selection of winners and losers. The internet is devolving before our eyes. Now's the time to #SaveTheNet.
Thanks @BrianneGorod! I was so proud to lead this Amicus Brief w/@BrianSchatz, joined by @SpeakerPelosi 126 House Senate Dems.  The citizenship q is unconstitutional will cause tremendous harm, if it’s not removed from the #2020Census.  So far, 2 out of 2 courts agree.
I’m delighted that four additional remarkable women will be honored as a part of the #SheBuiltNYC initiative! I hope these monuments will remind young women of their limitless potential and inspire all New Yorkers for many years to come.
@USEEOC pay data collection is back into effect after Trump improperly blocked it. Understanding pay discrepancies across race gender is vital to ending pay discrimination. This is an important victory for equal
A 2nd federal court just order the Trump Admin to remove the citizenship q from the #2020Census. This question never belonged there in the first place and this summary from the decision perfectly lays out why. Supreme Court must affirm.
The US is the only developed country in the world w/ no form of paid family leave policy. It's time we modernize our workplaces support our employees - that's why I intro'ed the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act to give fed employees 12 wks paid FMLA leave
Proud to stand with @RepMaxineWaters @RepAlGreen @RepBillFoster @RepBeatty and @RepRashida this morning to intro the #ConsumersFirstAct to undo all of the damage Mick Mulvaney did while he was Acting Director of @CFPB. Time to put consumers 1st again
HR1 will protect voters, secure our elections, make the gov’t process more transparent. Join the #TownHallForThePeople for more info!
TY to the NY State Legislature for taking this step and passing legislation designed to make ballots easier to read and understand. These are needed reforms that will make the voting process simpler and more accessible.
Today @RepWexton @LeaderHoyer @RepDonBeyer I intro'd the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act b/c having children getting sick are a part of life. Employers need to anticipate this support workers rather than leave them high dry. See my statement here:
Watch live as I introduce the Federal Employee Paid Leave Ave w/ @LeaderHoyer, @RepWexton and @RepDonBeyer
(2/2) That's why @LeaderHoyer, @RepWexton, @RepDonBeyer and I are intro'ing the Federal Employee Paid Leave Act to give federal workers 12 wks paid leave for new children, sick family, or personal illness. There should be no agonizing choice between caring for family a career
(1/2) Only 17% of workers in the US have access to paid family leave through their employers. This means that 83% of American workers who must take care of old/new family have to choose between that and earning a living. This lack of support is unacceptable.
The reality of the workforce is that the typical AAPI woman must work more than an extra two months to make what the average white man makes in 1 year. This is textbook inequality. We need #AAPIEqualPay so that AAPI women families have a fighting chance. #NotYourModelMinority
Join me at my State of the District presentation this Sunday at 1pm! I’ll be discussing my legislative work in Washington, infrastructure investments in NYC, and the status of ongoing projects in #NY12. Hope to see you there!
Thrilled to see NYC girls officially welcomed into the @boyscouts! @SydneyBIreland demanded that girls be able to access the same opportunities as boys in the Scouts, and I am so glad that many young women are now able to officially join Scouts BSA.
The ugly truth is that the toll of 9/11 is still being taken. Our nation will not heal w/o ensuring that the first responders survivors who are STILL suffering and dying as a direct result of 9/11 have the care support they need. We must #Renew911VCF
With our democratic institution more threatened than ever, it is critical that we pass #HR1 to improve election security, protect voter rights, promote gov't transparency, restore faith in gov't #ForThePeople. My friend @Alyssa_Milano's take:
This is horrible. Anti-Semitism is not a joke or a game. We must teach kids better than this. We need to pass H.R. 943, the Never Again Education Act, to help teach students about the Holocaust the destruction caused by hate.

This is a make or break moment for the #2020Census our democracy. The Trump Administration broke the law violated the constitution when it added the citizenship question. SCOTUS must order the question to be removed.
On the 1st day that Congress is next in session, I will be introducing bipartisan legislation, the Never Forget the Heroes Act that will fully fund make permanent the VCF w/ @RepJerryNadler, @RepPeteKing, @SenGillibrand, @SenCoryGardner, @SenSchumer.
My heart goes out to the families of the victims. All nations should condemn this reckless attack and work to bring the perpetrators to justice while engaging diplomatically to bring a long term peace to the region. 2/2
This despicable terrorist attack on Indian officers in Kashmir is evil in its purest form and only exacerbates the danger in this decades long dispute with nuclear implications. 1/
Trump lost big in this deal. No Trump border wall and we were able to get some big wins for progressive priorities incl #2020census infrastructure housing. I'm proud to have voted YES. Full statement here:
I’m live with @GAGnoguns in DC. Together we will #endgunviolence.
Declaring a state of emergency when there actually isn’t one is an extremely dangerous precedent to set. There is no emergency at the border, just hysterics and fear mongering from the president. This will not go unchallenged or unchecked.
Heart disease kills 1 in 3 women each and every year. That is unacceptable. I #GoRedForWomen to fight against heart disease and make sure we all know the signs to look for.
I'll continue working with the residents of Queensbridge, Ravenswood, Astoria Houses, Woodside and all #LIC #NY12 to strengthen our economy bring good paying jobs to NY. 4/4
As I said on Monday, "W 25K well-paying jobs coming to the neighborhood, the residents of Queensbridge, Ravenswood, Astoria Houses, Woodside have good chances for the future. We need to make sure that ... opportunities lead to jobs 3/
The deal could have been improved. There were legitimate concerns raised and aspects that I wanted changed. I was ready to work for those changes. But now, we won’t have a chance to do that and we are out 25K+ new jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars in new investments. 2/
Disappointed that NYC wont be home to 25K+ new jobs from HQ2 that LIC will lose out on infrastructure improvements that would have accompanied this project. This is not the Valentine that NY needed. 1/
Proud to have @RepMaxRose @RepLeeZeldin leading outreach to newer members on the importance of keeping the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund fully funded reauthorized. With them, @RepJerryNadler, @RepPeteKing I will pass our bill to make it happen.
Today, we remember the 17 innocent lives taken 1 year ago. Today, let's recommit to #EndGunViolence.#ParklandStrong
Today, we passed @RepRoKhanna's legislation to end American support for the war in Yemen. Proud to have voted for the bill. The Senate must now do the same. #YemenCantWait
No mother should ever need to write a letter like this. We must #EndGunViolenceTogether.
The dire threat of climate change is as real as these practical ideas for combating it. The time to act is yesterday #GreenNewDeal
