If President Trump can afford to step away from Mar-a-Lago or his meetings with dictatorial autocrats, I'd be glad to show him around Northern Ohio. He'll see firsthand how his disastrous trade policies have wreaked havoc on our working class communities.
Clearly no one in President Trump’s Administration has explained to him that bad trade deals, tariffs against our allies, and tax cuts for the wealthy lead to trade deficits, lost jobs, and reduced wages for average Americans.
President Trump said manufacturing jobs would flow back to the industrial Midwest and wages would rise like never before. Not only has he broken that promise, his policies have caused the trade deficit to explode, plants to shut down, and wages to plummet.
“Trade wars are easy to win.”
The Trump Administration now owns higher tariffs AND a higher deficit. Now that's some fine policy

I thank our veterans’ service organizations, including @AmericanLegion and @PVA1946, for supporting the VET HP Act and look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to advance the VETS HP Act to the President’s desk without delay.
The bill prioritizes students in medically underserved areas, first-generation college students, students referred by minority-serving institutions, and veterans, narrowing the professional gap and ensuring we train pre-med students in careers that are in demand necessary.
The VET HP Act creates a pilot program for pre-med students specializing in health professions where there is an identified staffing shortage and allows them to gain clinical observation experience at one of five pilot VA centers.
Pleased to report the House passed my bill to cultivate the next generation of #veterans health professionals. Veterans in our communities deserve the best possible care, but that can't happen if we don’t fill the tens of thousands of healthcare vacancies across @DeptVetAffairs.
Privileged to serve alongside these incredible women. When I came to Congress, there were only 24 women. Today, we’re blessed to have 127. This #WomensHistoryMonth, we honor the sung and unsung suffragettes who fought for equal representation in Congress and at the ballot box.

While #BlackHistoryMonth may be coming to an end, let us continue to celebrate and reflect upon the remarkable historical and cultural contributions Black Americans make in all our communities and across the nation.

As #BlackHistoryMonth comes to a close, we highlight Jera’s Heavenly Sweet— a thriving Black owned business in our community.

President Trump’s declaration was not founded in the security of our nation, but an outsized ego. Tonight, I voted for bipartisan legislation to terminate the declaration of a #FakeNationalEmergency.
FCA’s investment will help bolster our highly-skilled workforce, ensure future innovation, set us on a path to surpass overseas competitors such as  China, which produces 96% of all EVs; all while taking steps to combat climate change and keep automotive jobs in Northern Ohio.
Since 1941, Toledoans have not only built Jeep into one of the most popular vehicle brands in the world, but also into a household name synonymous w/ American grit, determination, ingenuity. Jeep is in our soul. It’s our tradition we want to see it succeed far into the future
With rapidly changing driver preferences toward electric and other environmentally friendly alternatives, Jeep’s domestic investment in vehicle electrification is critical, especially as SUV’s and trucks become American consumers’ vehicle of choice.
While electric drivetrain components will be built in Michigan, FCA’s investment in electrification will almost certainly benefit Jeep’s production platform and vehicles produced in nearby Toledo, such as the Wrangler and the upcoming Gladiator pickup truck.
FCA's announcement is exciting news for fans of the iconic Jeep brand. Electrification of Jeep vehicles is a necessary important step to future-proof the brand the tens of thousands of Toledo-based manufacturing jobs that have supported Jeep since WWII
58 ex-national security officials speak out against #FakeNationalEmergency and rightly so – it’s an unconstitutional attempt to circumvent Congress force Americans to pay for an ill-advised campaign scam. Remember #MexicoWillPay?

Today I am joining 222 of my House colleagues in cosponsoring @JoaquinCastrotx’s legislation to immediately terminate President Trump’s #FakeNationalEmergency.

This will be the fourth time the Navy has honored the City of Cleveland as a ship’s namesake. Upon the ship’s successful completion in 2023, the ship will be commissioned at the Port of Cleveland before joining its fleet in Mayport, Florida.

As the Chair of the House Energy and Water Subcommittee, I am honored to have played a part in securing this important investment in our Great Lakes. These funds will help reign in the spread of deadly algal blooms and the invasive Asian carp population.
President Trump’s declaration of a #FakeNationalEmergency is an unlawful power grab and an affront to our Constitution. We need operational border security, not an ineffective wall. What ever happened to Mexico paying for this ill-advised campaign promise?
President Trump just acknowleged at his announcement, “I don’t need to do this, I’d just rather do it much faster.” The situation at the southern border is not a national emergency and President Trump knows it. #FakeNationalEmergency
We also cannot allow the President to pick the pockets of DOD, canceling high-priority military construction projects in communities at home and abroad, thereby eroding training, readiness, and quality of life for our troops.
The President can’t be allowed to steal urgently needed funds from the Army Corps of Engineers and slow life-saving disaster prevention projects reconstruction efforts for real disasters in Puerto Rico, Texas, USVI, Florida.
With Border crossings down to 1/5 of what they were in 2000, arrests at their lowest level in over 4 decades, many women and children crossing who pose no threat to national security. We should focus on most vulnerable points on the southern border: ports of entry.
Deeply concerned by President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency at the southern border as justification for building a wall. A wall won't protect the most vulnerable points on the southern border: ports of entry.
Past national security emergencies have involved hurricanes, wildfires, hostage crises, epidemics and public health emergencies and terrorist attacks posing grave and immediate risk to American lives. The situation at the border clearly falls short.

It’s almost as though @realdonaldtrump and @GOP didn’t have working people in mind when they rammed the #TrumpTaxScam through Congress:
Harmful algal blooms have contaminated Lake Erie for years, but Dr. Jason Huntley of @UToledo has discovered that a naturally forming bacteria can purify the drinking water, possibly replacing the use of chlorine in water treatment.
Remember @GOP’s rushed tax “reform” bill? Now, the average tax refund for middle class taxpayers has shrunk, and millions more will receive no refund at all. It’s time for Congress to put tax cuts for working class Americans first, not payouts to the rich.
We can't allow the American public to be caught up in yet another #TrumpShutdown. It’s time we work together to pass an agreement that keeps our government open, honors are hardworking public servants, takes meaningful steps to improve border security.
I can’t think of anyone who fought harder for veterans or those in our military than Walter. He was a man of conscience and an astute and inspiring legislator. My prayers are with Walter’s loving family as they walk through these difficult days.
I'm heartbroken by the passing of my beloved friend and colleague Congressman Walter Jones. I thank the people of North Carolina’s 3rd Congressional District for sending such an honorable dignified gentleman to the House for over two decades.
Just the latest example of how low these abusive institutions will sink to turn a quick profit.
Big Banks promised to use the billions saved from the Trump Tax Break to support workers, help low-income families, give back to our communities. Instead, they're predictably lining the pockets of executives investors at the expense of working people.

As a nation, our focus should be on improving the lives of low-income and middle class Americans, bringing good jobs back to our communities, and implementing trade practices that effectively raise wages, improve working standards, and create opportunity.
President Trump’s infatuation with an expensive and ineffective border wall is a disservice to hardworking Americans across the country.
Tonight we heard more of the same from @realDonaldTrump. Ohioans deserve better.
Yet whether it’s on trade, infrastructure, tackling the opioid crisis, prescription drug costs, or effective border security, President Trump has not only failed to deliver on their behalf, he has pushed policies that have actively hurt them.

Second, a bill requiring TV stations to grant 2 hours of free advertising to each qualified federal or statewide candidate. This would help level the playing field for viable candidates running against campaigns bankrolled by special interests.
