H.R. 1 is a misguided bill with many problems. One problem in particular has united everyone from @heritage to the @ACLU. It’s the bill’s assault on free speech. The ACLU itself says H.R. 1 will “chill speech essential to our public discourse”.
I offered an amendment on the House Floor today to H.R. 1 expressing the sense of Congress that free speech should be protected. Why are Democrats opposing an amendment simply reaffirming free speech?

The Dems claim that they want the truth. Yet, their first witness to testify before Congress is Michael Cohen, who is going to prison for lying to Congress. Let that one sink in. He’s going to prison for lying to  Congress. And he’s their star witness!
With all the lies, fraud, and deception, it begs the question, what are the Democrats doing with this hearing? Cohen will say whatever he wants to accomplish his own personal goals. His presence here is a travesty. I hope the American people will see through this.
This man plead guilty to cheating on his taxes and lying to the IRS. Nothing he says or produces has any credibility. He lied about delivering his own child, and his wife had to correct the record.
If the Democrats were after the truth today, they would have had an honest person here testifying. And they would not have limited the questioning to just their chosen few topics.
How is Michael Cohen credible to testify on financial transactions when he lied on financial documents?
The Democrats are asking someone who lied to Congress and broke campaign finance laws to be the star witness to our hearing at Oversight Reform. Is this the best witness they have?

There is also an argument to be made, as many have, that Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump due to her extreme position on abortion.
