Before Michael Cohen's testimony last week, he and Adam Schiff met for TEN hours. But last Sunday, Schiff told CBS his only contact with Cohen was to "invite him to testify" and "allay concerns."Really? That took 10 hours?We need answers. Did Democrats lead the witness?

House Democrats' first major project of this Congress? It's #HR1—a bill that funnels taxpayer money into the pockets of Washington politicians and their re-election campaigns.Yes—that's you, the taxpayer, subsidizing politicians in Congress.
Two years, millions of dollars spent, and zero evidence of collusion—but that apparently won’t stop Adam Schiff and Democrat investigators. Now hiring an MSNBC analyst and prosecutor for more Russia investigations. This is a conspiracy machine desperately in search of a crime.
On the eve of the special counsel's report, the Democrats' 'Russian collusion' narrative is fading for one reason: because there was no collusion. It was a political conspiracy theory. To say the case "fell apart" would be kind—because there never was a case from the beginning.

I just entered a referral for criminal investigation of Michael Cohen, who violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act by illegally lobbying on behalf of foreign entities without registeringCohen talks about "blind loyalty." His real blind loyalty? It's to the almighty dollar.
As Michael Cohen speaks, think about how remarkable it is: a man convicted of LYING to Congress is now appearing before Congress again... just weeks later. Invited by the Democrats as their star 'witness.' And all the while, the left hails his every word as gospel.
Direct quote from John Dean, advisor to Michael Cohen for this hearing, last night on CNN: "hold your statement as long as you can so the other side can’t chew it up."This was a willful violation of the rules. He did it intentionally. Oversight Democrats endorse this.
The Oversight Committee isn't just rolling out the red carpet to a convicted liar... they're letting him intentionally break committee rules.Michael Cohen purposefully broke the 24 hour disclosure rule and hid his so called "evidence" from Congress. We just got it this morning.

RT @jasoninthehouse: Seems to have time to meet with everybody but Congress
Interesting to see Rod Rosenstein speak at a "Strategic Studies" conference discussing 'Rule of Law.' The real "strategy" = appearing there and not before Congress, under oath.Still waiting to hear: Did Rosenstein discuss "wearing a wire" and secretly taping President Trump?
Schiff has been reciting this line for almost two years, conveniently omitting key info every time. Reason why is simple: when you look at all the facts, you find no real evidence supporting "Russian collusion" exists. It's a conspiracy driven by nothing more than political aims.
An important move from the President here on Title X and yet another promise kept. Forcing taxpayers to fund abortion providers is wrong and should’ve ended long ago.
Stunning admission here. McCabe is basically acknowledging he + his team opened an investigation of @realDonaldTrump without real evidence. There was no secret intelligence or smoking gun. Just things he and his biased team thought were “suspicious.” Incredible abuse of power.
Listen to what lead Democrats, including Adam Schiff, are starting to tell you. They’re now declining to say they'll accept the Mueller report if the report finds no collusion. Their message is shifting. The "Russian collusion" narrative is falling apart, and they know it.
Andy McCabe’s interview last night only furthered what anyone who has been truly investigating already knew: senior Intel officials were bent on retaliating against President Trump for personal reasons, and they were willing to throw out any rule or break any protocol to do it
Adam Schiff and Democrats continue Sunday after Sunday making claims that they all know are NOT true. Papadopoulos and Flynn were not colluding with Russia. Schiff knows, Intel community knows, and FBI knows.Enough. Declassify the documents. Let Americans see the truth.
Democrats have spent 2 years attacking anyone who dare raise questions about the foundation of the Mueller investigation. And now they say they’ll keep investigating if Mueller doesn’t find what they want. Amazing.
So did Andy McCabe mislead the 60 Minutes interviewer, just like he did FBI investigators? Unreal. Time and time again he seems to forget... only to remember incorrectly. One thing he certainly never forgot: his remarkable and unrelenting bias against Donald Trump.
POTUS' declaration is legal + well founded. To my Democrat colleagues complaining about executive authority: welcome aboard! Good to have you. If you're ready to permanently rein in executive branch power and give it back to Congress, once and for all--I'll work with you. Today.

Democrats’ refusal to negotiate has rendered Congress inept at doing its job to protect Americans. At this point POTUS is absolutely right to use constitutional executive action authority to build the wall and secure our border. This is a national emergency. I fully support him.

Democrats applaud sending $1.8 billion to Iran under Obama but can’t even find that much to secure America’s border. If this is the best they can do, it’s obvious they have no interest in serious border security. At this point it’s clear: POTUS should take executive action.
This conference agreement is hardly a serious attempt to secure our border or stop the flow of illegal immigration. It kicks the can down the road yet again, failing to address the critical priorities outlined by Border Patrol Chiefs.Congress is not doing its job.
A blatant Democrat contradiction: they claim "walls won't work," and advocate for "staffing and technology." THEN: they push for limiting ICE space, making it harder to detain criminals.They are supporting open borders and disguising it as "smart policy." Let's be honest.
With the report of Adam Schiff meeting with Fusion GPS's Glenn Simpson last summer, we now have more evidence of Schiff directly contacting people trying to interfere in our election than we ever did on candidate Trump.Double standard. The collusion investigation is a sham.
Democrats now want a hard cap on the number of beds at ICE detention facilities. How is that a serious or defensible position? They are openly trying to hamstring law enforcement and make it easier for thousands of migrants (some with criminal records) to be released into the US.
Deeply saddened by the passing of Walter Jones—a beloved colleague and friend who had a profound impact on all through his graciousness, character, and committed Christian faith. God be with and keep his family. We will miss him.
Some are asking for my two cents on the Green New Deal. Here it is: our “shared wealth” would be literally about two cents if we tried this.
If Adam Schiff and Democrats are truly interested in transparency, how about we declassify documents so Americans can see the full truth. Let's start with the docs on George Papadopoulos. Schiff knows, I know, and the FBI knows that Papadopoulos was not part of any collusion.
Nancy Pelosi didn't even wait for negotiations before declaring "no wall money." The "conference committee" spent more time watching the Super Bowl then they have actually meeting. Do we really think this conference will result in a serious compromise to secure our border?
So after nearly two years of investigations, zero evidence of collusion, and plenty of debunked conspiracy theories—including from Chairman Schiff himself—Congressional Democrats now want to EXPAND the Russia probe. Seriously.
RT @freedomcaucus: Thanks @seanhannity for your support!
Third trimester abortions have historically been opposed by +80% of the country. This isn't a partisan issue.Last night, when @POTUS stood up against late-term abortion and defended the sanctity of life, he wasn't speaking for the GOP. He was speaking on behalf of Americans.
Disappointed so many Democrats seemed to have super glue on their seats last night. Many of them could barely applaud for record low unemployment numbers--or even for an ICE agent fighting sex trafficking.
What a powerful SOTU address from @POTUS, from honoring the greatest generation to reminding us as Americans to embrace the opportunities ahead.Democrats now have a choice: are they more interested in attacking this President, or working together for America’s people?
There is zero indication Acting AG Whitaker will decline to appear before the Judiciary Committee or fully answer their questions... yet the Democrats are readying a subpoena anyway. This is purely political and a far cry from the careful use of subpoena authority Dems promised.
Over 2+ years working with Congress POTUS has made multiple reasonable offers to build the wall and secure our country. Democrats continue to reject every single one.It’s clear he has no choice but to use his national emergency option to take action and make America safe again.
Border Patrol Agents and Chiefs are the premier border enforcement experts. It’s their recommendations on how to stop drugs and curtail human trafficking that we should be taking and using. Giving them the money, the laws, and the support to do their jobs should be bipartisan.
Economy booming, unemployment at record lows, taxes cut, military rebuilt, embassy in Jerusalem, American hostages home, North Korea negotiating, a renegotiated NAFTA + new trade deals in the works...And pundits want to criticize the President’s schedule? Give me a break.
Remember: Adam Schiff (and many on the left) repeatedly said GOP memo detailing FISA abuse was wrong. Transcripts from FBI/DOJ witnesses not only prove Schiff statements false, but confirm FISA abuse. FBI knew there was NO collusion for months yet continued the investigation.
.@realdonaldtrump: holding dozens of meetings to find a border security compromise"Conference committee:" 1 meeting in 7 days, with 0 additional meetings currently scheduledAnd people wonder why POTUS is being forced toward executive action. Why isn't conference working 24/7?
Democrats applaud Obama for secretly going around Congress and sending $1.8 billion to Iran, yet they threaten to sue POTUS for using executive action to protect American families. Blatant politics. They didn't negotiate during the shutdown and are hardly pretending to now.
Amazing. Hardly 24 hours in to conference talks and Speaker Pelosi announces "no wall money" in a bill. This is a total and open refusal to even negotiate on something fundamental to a secure border.Stop pretending Democrats are negotiating. Democrats aren't even pretending.
Democrats insisted for a month they were ready to negotiate on border security when government reopened. It’s been nearly a week and we have yet to see even one Dem compromise counteroffer to the multiple proposals from POTUS. This is not a negotiation—one side isn’t negotiating.
At least Senator Harris is honest. I remember a former President once telling us: "if you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it."That didn't work out well. And neither would "Medicare for All."
Don’t confuse indictments with collusion. Yes, if someone lies under oath, they should be held accountable. But bottom line: it’s been 20+ months, and we have seen ZERO evidence of any Russian collusion. These Mueller moves have nothing to do with POTUS.There was no collusion.
The notion that our southern border needs ZERO additional physical barriers is counter-intuitive and not based in reality. POTUS wants technology and personnel too. Parts of a wall = a common sense PART of the solution. End the political grandstanding. Let's find a compromise.
Praying today for @RepWalterJones, a dear friend and total class act
.@POTUS has said that border barrier construction will commence within weeks. The next 3 weeks will determine whether Congress will do its job and define the construction process. Compromise is important, but not required, to secure our border and protect American families.
Democrats have been saying for weeks they’ll negotiate on wall funding when the government is open. POTUS is now giving them yet ANOTHER opportunity to come to the table. Americans will be able to judge for themselves whether Democrats are truly serious about securing our border.
Democrats decry federal workers not getting paid in one breath and then cancel votes to leave town early in another. Ridiculous—the shutdown is 33 days old. Where is the sense of urgency? There is zero reason anyone in Congress should go home until this is resolved. Period.
1/3: Speaker Pelosi invites Trump for SOTU1/16: Pelosi changes course, says “security concerns” prevent SOTU from happening1/16: DHS and Secret Service fact-check Pelosi, say they’re fully prepared1/23: Pelosi then disinvites @POTUS Blatant partisan games on display
Speaker Pelosi invited President Trump to give the SOTU on 1/3, when the shutdown was 2 weeks in, and then tried to reverse her own invitation by making up a "security" excuse when both DHS and Secret Service say they're fully ready.POTUS is exactly right. SOTU should proceed.
The politically motivated attacks on Covington Catholic students have been appalling to watch. All over a grossly mischaracterized story. Very clear there is a double standard for conservatives. Wear a MAGA hat, and your side of the story doesn't matter. Dangerous and wrong.
The Democrats’ answer to every single offer from President Trump continues to be “no,” without any effort to compromise or meet in the middle. They are not negotiating. They’ve become the party of “resistance” and not “reason.”
Grateful for Dr. King’s legacy of fighting for equality and valuing the content of one’s character above all. And may we always remember perhaps one of the greatest principles he stood for: “the time is always right to do what is right.”
Democrats have made it extremely clear this shutdown is all about opposing Trump for them. It’s time to pursue other options. 10 USC 274/284 would allow for fence construction without national emergency. Protect our communities, build the wall, and forget unreasonable Democrats.
This is the latest and most significant step yet of POTUS showing his willingness to negotiate and compromise with Democrats on the issue of wall funding. At this point, if Democrats refuse to come to the table, it will show they are not at all serious about solving this impasse.
Today’s development only underscores the need for the special counsel to wrap this investigation up immediately. The constant secrecy and breathless speculation helps no one. It’s been 20 months—enough is enough. Wrap it up. Show us what you have.
To all the pro-life activists marching in D.C. today--THANK YOU for speaking up for those who cannot speak for themselves. Our cause of protecting innocent life is always one worth fighting for.
First it was Hawaii. Then it was Puerto Rico. Then it was using military aircraft to fly overseas... all while the government is shut down.Bravo to POTUS. The Speaker (and all members) should stay in Washington until Democrats can compromise and secure our southern border.
Homeland Security and Secret Service say they're fully prepared to secure the State of the Union.Let's call Speaker Pelosi's cancelation what it is. The Democrat party continues to move left supporting open borders--and they want to avoid being exposed for it.

Nancy Pelosi's claim that she's canceling the State of the Union over  "security concerns" related to the shutdown would almost be believable--if she hadn't already scheduled and invited the President to speak on January 3rd, when the shutdown was 2 weeks old
Democrats go on holiday vacations while @POTUS stays in DC. They turn down a bipartisan invitation to the WH. And now they dis-invite the President from the State of the Union.What about Democrats' actions says they're serious about compromising to solve this? Nothing.
Every member of Congress should have to stay in Washington, DC and work--without receiving a paycheck--until we reach an agreement on wall funding. No excuses.If Democrats are ready to take border security seriously, there's a compromise to be had.
House Democrats just rejected an invitation from President Trump to come to the White House for a bipartisan discussion on border security solutions.And they expect voters to believe they're serious about negotiating to find a compromise? Americans aren't buying it.
RT @freedomcaucus: Official position: HFC calls for House to stay in session through the weekend and next week, instead of gaveling out and…
Every year the US government pays billions of dollars to people in error. Possible compromise: an amendment allowing recovered money to be spent on border barriers. It wouldn’t appropriate even ONE new dollar, allowing Democrats to keep their promises while securing our borders.
Democrats were at $0 for wall funding 3 weeks ago. Today? They're still at $0. The notion that negotiations have stalled is a myth because Dems have not negotiated to start with. When Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer get serious about compromising, we can solve this impasse.
The NYT piece on the FBI investigating Trump was intended to absolve FBI leadership. It actually does the opposite. It reveals FBI chose to investigate POTUS to retaliate against him for firing Comey. They NEVER had any real evidence but opened an investigation anyway. Unreal.
For Congress to be out for the weekend on recess right now makes zero sense. The government is shut down. Our southern border remains vulnerable. Why shouldn’t Congress stay in DC and continue negotiating until we get the job done?
Democrats continue to refuse to negotiate in good faith or appropriate any money for border barriers. If they won’t compromise, POTUS should use asset forfeiture money or other discretionary fees to start construction. If not, he should declare a national emergency. It's time.
There's a false narrative going around that wall negotiations between Republicans and Democrats are going nowhere. It's false because Democrats are not negotiating. At all. Their position is: NO areas of the border need ANY wall funding. No attempt at compromise whatsoever.

One of the biggest misdirection tactics you're seeing from the left: they're pretending President Trump is ONLY asking for a wall. This is not true. The WH has requested more personnel, technology, etc.--all things we need too. Wall funding is a necessary PART of the solution.
Democrats' position in this shutdown is neither reasonable nor sustainable. Holding government funding hostage because you oppose money for parts of a border wall at $5 billion (that's less than 1/10th of 1% of the budget) is not reasonable. Americans expect compromise.

Law enforcement and the President both agree: we need a border wall to keep our communities safer. Enough with the partisan games. It’s time for Congress to step up and do its job—protect our communities and support our law enforcement. Build the wall.
Nancy Pelosi’s newest funding proposal doesn’t represent any serious attempt to secure our border or find a compromise. A $1.3 billion Democrat wish list that includes zero money for a border barrier is a non-starter and will not be a legitimate answer to this impasse.
Nancy Pelosi told President Trump on national TV the House didn’t have the votes for a border wall bill. We did. It passed easily.The House passed it. The WH wants it. The Senate majority wants it. The one blocking an open government and a secure border: Chuck Schumer.

Reports showing caravan heading toward our southern border. People rushing entry points. It's about time Congress show as much resolve to SECURE our border as the individuals seeking to tear it down. We have to fund the wall in December. It's now or never.
Happy Thanksgiving from my family to yours! We're so grateful for God's grace and the incredible blessings we enjoy in the greatest nation on earth. Hope you and your family have been blessed today.

Good move. This will be a positive step toward limiting youth access to e-cigarettes while still providing alternatives for adult smokers.

Chilling footage. America must stand unequivocally with our ally Israel and their right to defend themselves against this violence. Praying for our Israeli brothers and sisters tonight.
The goal for a House Republican minority in the coming Congress should be clear and simple: show the same kind of commitment, energy, and resolve to keep our promises that the President has shown in keeping his
To all our veterans and military families: thank you. Your service and willingness to answer the call has allowed so many to enjoy the blessings of freedom in America--and today we honor your courage, bravery, and sacrifice. #VeteransDay
Democrats say they are serious about holding government accountable. Ok. Then let's subpoena Rod Rosenstein and declassify any documents that will reveal the truth about whether the FBI failed to disclose critical information in the FISA process.
Thanks so much to the great people of Western North Carolina for allowing me to serve you for another term. I'll continue fighting for taxpayers and getting government off the backs of working people!
Fall in the Western North Carolina mountains. There's nothing like it.
Great to see Fire Chief Bobby Craig from George Hildebrand Fire Department in Connelly Springs! Annual BBQ event with some of the best barbecue in the district.
Once again, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump keeps his promise. Iran has made clear their intention to bankroll terrorism, fund nuclear weapons programs, and target our allies like Israel. This message is clear: America will not endorse the agenda of Iran's corrupt regime. Enough.

"U.S. employers added 250,000 jobs in October... soaring past expectations." This is not a blip on the radar. These are record-setting trends. When you lower taxes, cut needless regulations, and empower workers, families, and businesses--America
North Carolina's economy is thriving under @POTUS @realDonaldTrump's policies of lower taxes and less regulation:- Lowest state unemployment rate in nearly 20 years- Trade, transportation, and utility sector employment up 3.3%- NC's 'Real Gross State Product' up 2.6%
Over several interviews, we've learned information suggesting the FBI secretly transcribed, and even taped, George Papadopoulos in 2016. If these "tapes" do exist, the DOJ must make them available to Americans immediately. Their complete refusal to be transparent helps no one.
President Trump just made the point on @IngrahamAngle: he has made everything available in the Russia investigation because he has nothing to hide.He's right. There was no collusion. The notion that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia was a farce from the beginning.

Mourning with all Americans today over the senseless attack on our Jewish brothers and sisters in Pittsburgh. May God give the victims' families and friends His peace that surpasses all understanding.
Very grateful for our law enforcement professionals who quickly tracked down the perpetrator of this week’s heinous actions. This conduct should be prosecuted and held accountable to the fullest extent.
Applause @realDonaldTrump for signing S. 1595 expanding sanctions on countries supporting Hezbollah and its agents. This will be a force in disrupting Hezbollah financial networks and sends an unequivocal message that America will not tolerate sponsorship of terrorism.
The booming American economy keeps thriving. We've now seen back to back quarters of +3.0% growth. This is on top of nearly 4.2 million jobs created since @POTUS was elected and the lowest unemployment rate since 1969.
What's even clearer after today's interview with George Papadopoulos: the blatant double standard for the politically connected.Papadopoulos lies to the FBI: goes to prison.Andy McCabe lies to the FBI: walks free, and the left insists he get a full pension.See the problem?
Great honor to spend time this week meeting with #NC11 firefighters to thank them for their service. These are from Cedar Mountain, Patterson, Pleasant Gardens, and Salem Fire Departments. They're outstanding teams. Thanks to all our first responders for everything you do.
@mrlaufer @GRAMMYAdvocacy Thank you for making the trip out my friend--Beverly and the team enjoyed having you. You are welcome any time.
