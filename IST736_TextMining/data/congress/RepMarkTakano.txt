More than 10,000 students had their dreams stifled by another #4profit closure. The worst part is that warning signs of Argosy’s financial troubles were there, but @BetsyDeVosED @usedgov chose to ignore the red flags and failed to hold them accountable.

As expected, the Trump Administration released an overtime proposal that doesn't meet the needs of workers in today's economy. If this Admin. won't fix the rules that have been rigged against workers, Congress has to — that includes expanding overtime pay.

The inhumanity behind the internment of Japanese Americans is a stain on the fabric of our country that was born out of hate and politics rooted in fearmongering. We must ensure that no person is ever a target of despicable policies that are discriminatory and un-American.
Declaring a national emergency over a fabricated border crisis is an abuse of power. This political stunt is irresponsible and sets a dangerous precedent – all because @realDonaldTrump is not the master negotiator he claimed to be.

Fighting for veterans by protecting their benefits and improving their care is a responsibility I do not take lightly. As Chairman of @VetAffairsDems and with the help of @HouseDemocrats, we will continue to make the VA work for veterans.
RT @HRC: Congratulations to @RepMarkTakano, who is the only openly LGBTQ person who currently serves as a full committee chair.
RT @GeorgeTakei: Congratulations to my friend, @RepMarkTakano, on this well deserved chairmanship, as well as to all our Democrats for offi…
@GeorgeTakei Thanks, @GeorgeTakei. I promise you we are going to work really hard #ForThePeople!
This is the right thing to do, @RepJayapal. I'm throwing my support behind the @USProgressives' effort to repeal #PAYGO. The American people want us to deliver on bold, progressive reforms and this won't happen if PAYGO isn't repealed.To put it simply, #PAYGO needs to go. �
1st day of the #116thCongress: @HouseDemocrats passed legislation to end the #TrumpShutdown.2nd day: We introduced the #ForThePeople Act – our plan to empower voters and end years of GOP attacks on voting rights.Elections have consequences, this time it's very positive ones.
We’re here and we’re queer.
I am incredibly honored to have been elected by @HouseDemocrats to serve as Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. This Congress, we have the opportunity to get a lot of work done #ForThePeople – and fighting for veterans will be one of our top priorities.

I was so proud to cast my vote for the "best friend of America's veterans, Nancy D'Alesandro Pelosi!" Can you tell I was excited? #SpeakerPelosi
Snuck in a selfie with our newly elected Speaker, Nancy Pelosi! #SpeakerPelosi
It’s a new day for the U.S. Congress. Today, the most diverse U.S. House of Representatives in the history of our country will be sworn-in. America and Congress will be better because of it. #RepresentationMatters #116thCongress
ONE. MORE. DAY.Tomorrow, a House Democratic Majority will be sworn-in and Congress will get back to working #ForThePeople. The first item on the agenda: ending the ridiculous #TrumpShutdown.
Happy New Year!
As we reflect on 2018, let's remember the moments that brought us hope and the challenges we have yet to overcome. In just a few days, @HouseDemocrats will make Congress work #ForThePeople again.A special countdown: 3 days until a Democratic Majority gets sworn-in! #NYE
This year, the American people elected a record number of #LGBTQ candidates to Congress. LGBTQ Americans deserve equal protections under the law, that’s why we’ll work hard to make the passage of the #EqualityAct a reality next Congress.
2 children died at our border while in immigration detention. Their deaths should be investigated and proper procedures should be put in place to prevent this from ever happening again. Enough with the vile statements. These are people’s lives we’re talking about.
This is a new low, even for this President.
We moved! My new D.C. office is located in Cannon 420 (yes, we've heard all the jokes). Please stop by in the new year to say hello and to get a U.S. Capitol tour. If you have questions, call my office at (202) 225-2305 or visit See you soon �
Trump said he would be “proud” to shut down the government over his useless wall — so he did. And @HouseGOP have done nothing to end the #TrumpShutdown and ensure that federal workers are paid. @SpeakerRyan, this is your legacy.
Heartbreaking and despicable. On Christmas, an 8 year old child died in CPB custody. This happened on the heels of the death of 7 year old Jakelin Caal, who died in immigration detention earlier this month. Someone at @DHSgov must be held accountable.
Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas! May your day be filled with peace and joy. �
