We can be the Congress that finally solves the decades long border problem, but it will take real action. Specifically, congressional action.
After decades of failed promises and months of debate, Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave the House less than 20 hours to read and vote on a 1,200 page bill that builds just 55 miles of barrier to secure a 2,000-mile border. This flippant approach will do little to stop the border crisis.

If @POTUS is going to declare a national emergency at the border, he should declare one in Congress too. After all, it is congressional inaction that has caused this problem and offered no permanent solutions.
McCabe lied to investigators and was fired for violating ethics violations. Before that he ordered an unfounded probe and talked about forcefully removing @POTUS from office.But did you hear he has a new book? We must continue to unravel this corruption.

My Democratic colleagues would be well-served by heeding the pleas of sheriffs across the country and working on solutions that keep American families safe. The government shuts down on Friday. It’s time to put up or shut up.
Sheriffs who protect communities all across our nation know the dangers of an unsecured border, the damage done by unchecked drug flow and releasing criminals back out on our streets. Thank you @NationalSheriff.
House Dems are now demanding we reduce the number of beds @ICEgov has to 16k. That means ICE has to release 9k+ people. According to @NationalSheriff, 72% have a criminal background. This proposal prioritizes offenders over Americans. We can’t release criminals on our streets.
