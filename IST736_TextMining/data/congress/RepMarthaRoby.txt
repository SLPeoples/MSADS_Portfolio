VA officials talk about implementing changes making improvements, but it's past time to execute these ideas make this right for our veterans.
In Central AL, there have been times a veteran has sought out mental health care, received no follow-up, it resulted in suicide. We have a real problem in some of our VA health care systems. We have failed our veterans time time again. Now, 20 of them are giving up each day.
20 veterans commit suicide every day. This is a tragedy we must treat as more than just a number. Only 6 of the 20 who are taking their own lives received VA care in the 2 years prior to their death. One reason that's the case: Veterans don't trust the VA to take care of them.
Some members of Veterans of Foreign Wars from Alabama came by to meet with me yesterday afternoon and share their legislative priorities. Thank you for your time and work advocating for our nation’s veterans.

It was my honor to meet SSG Steve McQueen his family this afternoon. SSG McQueen survived an event in Afghanistan thanks to the helmet he was wearing. Last night, the Army presented him w/ that same helmet. I'm grateful for the sacrifices of SSG McQueen other heroes like him.
In Central AL, not only do we lack the personnel to handle caring for veterans at the VA, we also have a hard time recruiting outside providers because the VA makes it difficult to exchange medical records. Veterans are suffering. Somebody needs to feel the urgency to fix this.

Folks from the YMCA of Greater Montgomery stopped by to meet with me. We discussed the YMCA’s priorities and goals for the year and how I can be helpful. Thank you for coming by!

This week, I cosponsored a House Resolution recognizing @thef35 Joint Strike Fighter program as a critical component of our national security efforts that Congress must continue to properly fund support.

I, along w/ my fellow Republicans, want to see a reduction in violent crime gun violence – but H.R. 8 won’t accomplish that. Read more about my thoughts on this overreaching bill here:
In order to actually combat gun violence, we must take a long, hard look at making improvements in our society, like repairing our mental health care system enforcing existing laws. We must stop playing politics w/ legislation that will not benefit the American people.
Today, the House will vote on H.R. 8, a poorly drafted ill-considered bill that would punish lawful gun owners w/o doing anything to prevent gun violence. I urge my colleagues to oppose this measure get to work finding REAL solutions to #EndGunViolence.
Alabama Department of Veterans Affairs Commissioner Rear Admiral W. Kent Davis stopped by my office this afternoon. I am grateful for his leadership and look forward to working together in the future!
This afternoon, I met with some American Legion members. I always enjoy meeting with this great group and learning more about how I can better fight for our veterans. Thank you for coming by!

It should be a no-brainer to vote in favor of a bill requiring medical care for babies born alive during abortions, but yesterday Senate Democrats voted against the measure, and House Democrats continue to block us from voting on it at all. Unbelievable.
Tomorrow (2/26), at 12 p.m. ET, I'm leading a pro-life discussion at the Family Research Council about congressional efforts to defend the unborn. The event will be broadcast live on @FRCdc's website Facebook page, so plan to tune in! More info here:
Thanks, @AlanLCross. When a child is born alive, we're not talking about abortion anymore. I hope, no matter how opinions on abortion might vary, we can still agree that babies born alive must be protected.
Today, the Senate will vote to proceed to the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill that implements protections for babies born alive during abortion. Needs 60 yeas. I hope my friends on the other side of the Capitol say "NO" to infanticide.
I finished my week on the road in AL-02 with a visit to New Brockton where I stopped by their Town Hall building. It was great to talk with some constituents and local leaders, including Mayor Kathryn Holley and Town Clerk Debra Andrews. Looking forward to next time!

I, along w/ my fellow Republicans, want to see a reduction in violent crime rates of gun violence, but H.R. 8 won't accomplish that. My full statement on the bill is available here:
In order to actually #EndGunViolence, we must look at improvements to our mental health care system more effectively enforce laws on the books. We should not be wasting time on ineffective bills that only serve to impede upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans.
H.R. 8 would make these actions illegal: Loaning a gun to your neighbor, donating a firearm to a museum, gifting a gun to a relative. The bill would even make it a crime to remove firearms from a friend's house, at their request, if they express concerns about suicidal thoughts.
Late last night, I voted against Judiciary Committee passage of H.R. 8, a poorly drafted ill-considered bill that would punish lawful gun owners without doing anything to prevent gun violence.
