Democrats want to peer into every second of President Trump’s life, hoping to find a smoking gun. Their witch hunt is nothing more than a sham investigation in search of a fabricated crime, but they’re still going full steam ahead.
I unequivocally support condemning anti-Semitism, full-stop. I just think it's curious how we ended up here.Democrats had an objection to something said by a Democrat...but all the remarks on the floor, and a lot of the substance in the resolution, is about President Trump!

Our national security is strong when Israel is strong. Anti-Israel sentiment and anti-Semitism have no place in our nation or government. I’m proud of the work President Trump has done to move our embassy to Jerusalem, pull out of the Iran deal, and partner with our ally @Israel.
Voting against the border wall is a betrayal of the American people who voted for this president, who expect this wall to get built, and want illegal immigration to stop. #BuildTheWall

H.R. 1 is not only a bad bill, many provisions in it are unconstitutional. In summary, it forces states to restore voting rights of felons, endangers First Amendment rights, Federalizes congressional redistricting, andTurns the FEC into a partisan organization. #NOTForThePeople
Turns the FEC into a partisan organization: H.R. 1 would remove one member from the bipartisan six member panel, handing the majority party an opportunity to use the commission for political gain. #NOTForThePeopleAct #StealElectionsAct
Redistricts via unelected officials: H.R. 1 would hand the redistricting process over to an unelected committee, stripping the power from state governments and removing accountability and oversight from their constituents. #NOTForThePeopleAct
The Federal government counts the ballots: Ballots would no longer be counted by local governments. Instead, H.R. 1 gives the power to count votes to the federal government. #NOTForThePeopleAct #StealElectionsAct
Violates the First Amendment: The bill so vaguely describes a provision making it a criminal offense to “impede or prevent” someone from registering or voting that it could interfere with legitimate free speech activities. #NOTForThePeopleAct
Forces states to restore voting rights to felons: Removes power from the states to decide whether or not to restore felon voting rights -every felon released from prison would instantly be granted the opportunity to vote. #NOTForThePeopleAct
Automatically registers ineligible voters: States must automatically add individuals to the voting rolls if they participate in certain government programs like welfare and getting a driver's license. #NOTForThePeopleAct
Mandates same-day registration: States will be forced to register a person even up to and on the day of the request, easily leading to voter fraud. #NOTForThePeopleAct #StealElectionsAct
Sabotages state voter ID laws: Voters will not have to show ID at the polls when they vote - they'll only have to sign a piece of paper saying they are who they claim to be. #NOTForThePeopleAct

This would be what we call a "show vote" in Washington. It's a vote that won't result in any change to law or policy. But it allows Nancy Pelosi to virtue signal to the radical left about their open borders, abolish ICE agenda.
