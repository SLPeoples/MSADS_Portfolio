Women's leadership and innovation has always been a driving force for progress, I'm proud to see that finally reflected in Congress.Happy #InternationalWomensDay to women everywhere who are fighting to make this world a better place.
Only in Washington would we see a group of people actively trying to sabotage anti-corruption measures. The political stunt meant to distract, divide, and sow hatred, is yet again just another political game. Another example of why the American people hate politics. #HR1
BREAKING: we just passed #HR1, the most sweeping and comprehensive anti-corruption, pro-democracy legislation in the history of Congress. Whether it's to drain the swamp or end corruption in DC, we just did something unheard of in Washington--we kept our promise.

For those who have magically found their strength to tackle bigotry in our country, I would remind them it doesn’t take courage to condemn hate in another party, but it takes character to stand up to your own. That's why I voted in support of today's resolution.
Passing #HR1 is just the opening salvo—but we're not stopping here. This is just the first step in our efforts to change politics in this country. Because the American people are united and want the same thing. Our question to Republicans in the Senate is: whose side are you on?
Children are dying from fentanyl and heroin overdoses. With 90% of drugs of these drugs being intercepted at ports of entry, I wanted answers.

Great work by @FDNY helping make John's dream a reality.Especially on #RareDiseaseDay, it's so important for us to raise awareness on this and so many other diseases that don't always make the headlines.

Great meeting with representatives from @ProjHospitality yesterday. Thank you to Rev. Terry Troia, Rev. Karen Jackson, Zulma Cruz and all of your partners for stopping by, but more importantly for the incredible work you're doing for the people of Staten Island.
We're finally just a stroke of a pen away from building the seawall giving Staten Island families the relief and peace of mind they deserve.This has been an incredible team effort, and I'm proud that we're able to get this across the finish line.
Really enjoyed our conversation! Be sure to tune in this afternoon.
Great meeting @madeleine this morning and discussing with her the challenges we face on the global stage.
But until this is fully built, our work isn’t done, and I’m going to continue to be in close contact with the Army Corps and the local community to ensure the Seawall is built properly and on time.
Coupled with last week's funding agreement, this one-two punch will allow the Seawall to finally get built, and have the long-term stability the project requires. The Army Corps has told me that they expect construction to begin early next year.
BREAKING: My East Shore Seawall legislation just passed the House, sending it to the President's desk to be signed into law. Finally, Staten Island families will get the relief and peace of mind they deserve.
I'm proud to be helping lead the bipartisan fight to fully and permanently fund the VCF, because when it comes to doing what’s right, it’s about keeping our promises, and honoring those who put their lives on the line and didn’t ask anything in return. #Renew911VCF
Now is the chance to put action behind the words #NeverForget. Because with the #VCF running out of money and cutting benefits, thousands of 9/11 heroes and their families now face being forgotten.That’s wrong, and if we fail to make that right, shame on us. #Renew911VCF

It would be a broken promise of epic proportions if we allow the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund to run out, to cut benefits. Proud to help lead the fight to make sure that never happens.
The first responders who ran towards danger on 9/11 are now at incredibly high risk for diseases that can take years or even decades to manifest.They deserve the comfort of knowing that should they get sick years down the road, we'll have their backs just like they had ours.

I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure we bring every idea and resource to the table to accomplish that goal—including creating a super express train for South Shore residents as the Borough President has proposed.
As I’ve told anyone who will listen and even those who won’t, the ultimate goal for this ferry route must be to shorten the tortuous commute that Staten Islanders on the South Shore endure.

I made a promise when I was sworn in that if something matters to my constituents, well then it matters to me. That's why the first piece of legislation I introduced in Congress is to build the East Shore Seawall off Staten Island.
There’s no debate: climate change is real, storms are getting worse, and the East Shore seawall will help protect the lives and livelihoods of Staten Islanders.
For too long, Washington D.C. has let the lobbyists and the corporations dictate our healthcare system. That needs to change. So yesterday, I stopped by RUMC to talk to the doctors and nurses on the front lines about what we can do to help.
Background checks save lives, plain simple. In the states that have already passed background check laws:�53% fewer police officers are shot killed in the line of duty. �57% fewer women are shot to death by abusive partners. It’s time to say #NeverAgain and pass #HR8.
