For the faint of heart, who've been waiting for every "t" to be crossed and every "i" to be dotted, now is the time to demonstrate your patriotism. Support impeachment!
Trump, you have screamed no collusion and no obstruction of justice so many times, trying to influence others, that I think you really believe your own lies. Just stop it. No honesty. No truth. No trust. No patriotism.
Lying Trump, so you said you did nothing to force security clearance for Kushner, huh? Who do you think will believe that lie? Must give you credit. You are the boldest, most daring liar I've ever heard of.  A pox on all your houses.
Hey Manafort, Cohen, Flynn, Gates, Papadopoulos, Stone, its truth telling time, and the truth will free your heart and soul -- but no guarantees freedom from prison time.
Obstruction of justice reality show: Firing Comey, sending coded messages to Manafort others that he has the power to pardon; lying abt Trump Tower meeting; threatening Cohen's in-laws; attempting to destroy Mueller. What more do we need to know? Impeachment is the only answer
The killing with the chainsaw dismemberment of #JamalKhashoggi by the Saudis is the most gruesome heartless act imaginable! Now we learned his body parts were burned in a giant oven! Trump, God will never forgive you for siding w/ MBS on this murder.
Lying Trump said he believes killer Kim Jong-un, that he didn't know what happened to #ottowarmbier. Now he wants to flip the script. No one can believe this unworthy president. He is the most prolific, consistent, good for nothing liar this country has ever experienced.
Lying Trump came away from fake summit with terrorist killer Kim Jong-un w/ nothing because Kim never intended to offer anything. Don the con man got conned! Hey number 45, are you still in love w/ Kim?

CBS, the efforts on your website about your support for diversity fly in the face of your display of all of the reporters you've selected for the 2020 campaign. Not one Black. What's up with this? An explanation is needed.
Trump, you didn't get $5 billion to carry out your ill advised election promise now you want to declare an emergency. The only emergency facing our country is the need to impeach you before you destroy our country, our ideals, leadership in the world. Trump, go home. Bye bye!
Back in 2017, I dubbed Trump his allies w/ all their ties to Russia and Ukraine, the "Kremlin Klan".  I believed Trump colluded with Russians has been obstructing justice before our eyes.  What more do we need to see? via @YouTube
No surprise the FBI questioned Trump's allegiance to US! He meets w/ Putin 5 times in secret w/ no readout; gave Russians classified info in WH; disregarded US intel on Russia; praised Putin's election; lies abt his deals in Russia. Is there any question Trump is a Russian agent?
Trump has perfected the art of lying. No, #ConManDon, the FBI investigation hanging over your head is no witch hunt. You are engulfed in a web of lies deceit. Webs are created by poisonous dangerous spiders. You fit the profile.
Please. No one should wonder why Manafort gave polling data to Russians. The only reason Russians wanted this info was to use it against H. Clinton in support of Trump. Why do you think Manafort w/ all his ties to Russia Ukraine was in the campaign to begin with? Stay woke!
Americans should be shaken by what we know of Trump Putin's relationship should NOT be surprised by the FBI counterintelligence investigation. Is Trump a Russian agent? If it walks like a duck talks like a duck, then it is a duck - and the duck should be impeached.
Trump, even your most vocal defenders will turn on you w/ your shutdown when there's no food on the table, the rent is not paid, the car is repossessed, the children need shoes. No American who works for our govt should be treated this way while you are living off the govt.

John Kelly is one of a long list of failed incompetent Trump appointees that served in a dysfunctional White House. Kelly leaves with a cloud over his head because of the lie that he told on Congresswoman Frederica Wilson. He refused to apologize. Leaves WH in disgrace.
The frenzied speculation about what I will won’t do if selected to become Chair of @FSCDems has gotten out of hand. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Here is the letter I sent to my fellow Democrats about my work as Ranking Member of @FSCDems:
Lying Trump is using "America First" as his defense in helping Saudi Arabia cover up the horrific murder of a Washington Post journalist. The Saudis tortured, strangled dismembered #JamalKhashoggi. Trump's complete disregard for human life is immoral, weak, and disgusting.
Why does Trump have such an affinity for murderous autocrats? He defends Vladimir Putin of Russia, fell in love w/ Kim Jong Un of N Korea, admires Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines now refuses to accept CIA findings that the Saudi Crown Prince ordered #JamalKhashoggi's murder
What more does Trump have to brazenly tell us about his relationship to the Saudis? It's all about $. Trump sold a yacht to a Saudi royal, sold the 45th floor of Trump Tower to Saudis said he liked the Saudis "very much" b/c they buy $40M apartments from him #FollowtheMoney
Trump’s response to the California wildfires was a disgrace. Now he is trying to walk back his inappropriate comments. However, he’s a day late and a dollar short. The people of California will never forget his shameful lack of respect compassion
I applaud the efforts of the brave first responders, fire fighters, law enforcement officials, and volunteers across the state of California for their work and their sacrifice on behalf of those impacted by these devastating wildfires.
My prayers deepest sympathies are with all of those who have been impacted by the Camp and Woolsey wildfires, which have blazed a deadly path across our great state of California.


Betsy DeVos, you won’t get away with what you are doing. We are organizing to put an end to your destruction of civil rights protections for students.
Yesterday I met with Members of Congress, students great professional advocates who are fighting to protect students—particularly students of color, students w/ disabilities, transgender students survivors of sexual assault —from Betsy DeVos’ attacks on student civil rights.
I’m a strong supporter of the Los Angeles Air Force Base in El Segundo, which serves families across the South Bay and is the only full-service military base in greater Los Angeles. Thank you to the talented men women at LAAFB who work on behalf of veterans in our community!
I also salute one of my constituents, Judge Vincent Okamoto— a retired U.S. Army Captain who is the highest-decorated Japanese American veteran of the Vietnam War as a Purple Heart, Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry recipient
In addition to our annual #VeteransDay celebrations, I regularly honor the distinguished service of veterans in my district, as well as the legacy of heroes such as the Tuskegee Airmen – the 1st African-American military aviators in the U.S. Armed Forces.
Today I salute all of the courageous veterans servicemembers across the country. It is my honor to serve in Congress ensure that programs, such as the VA’s Center for Women Veterans which I created in 1994, meet the needs of those who have served sacrificed in the military.

In the final analysis, lies, fear mongering, and deceit can never win. The American people will reject Trump's disgraceful leadership. The truth will prevail and the American people will win.
If you're told that your name is not present at the polling place, demand a provisional ballot. You cannot be denied the right to vote on a provisional ballot.
Trump his allies at Fox News in Congress have overplayed their hands. Trump has clearly defined himself by stoking fear anger w/ racism, lies, accusations to win at any cost. It won't work.  The American people understand how dangerous Trump is will reject him today.

It should shock no one that #ConManDon is aligned with for-profit colleges that rip-off students. His own fraudulent school, Trump U, had to pay millions of $ to the students he cheated. Justice is finally being served.

Ok McConnell, keep on guaranteeing Kavanaugh's confirmation. Women have not had their say yet! Each day brings about new possibilities.
Kavanaugh, so many have come forward describing your abuse of alcohol. I think it is important that the American people know if you have ever sought treatment for alcohol abuse.
Hurray for the courageous women who confronted Sen. Flake! They are without a doubt the reason Sen. Flake joined Democrats to call for the one-week FBI investigation. Peaceful protest works!
Trump cannot vouch for anybody's honesty, integrity, or respect for women. Trump only chose Kavanaugh based on his declaration that a President cannot be indicted. So glad the Constitution defines impeachment.
Kavanaugh has proven that he is a puppet of Donald Trump. He got his marching orders and he promptly displayed Trump's lack of respect for others. Aren't Supreme Court justices supposed to be independent, and are they not expected to demonstrate the proper judicial temperament?
We believe you, Dr. Ford. Good lord! Women are outraged by the thought of you being smothered, having a man's hand held over your mouth as you attempted to cry out for help! We understand attempted rape!

I will always remember the critical moment when John McCain strode into the U.S. Senate and, with all eyes focused on him and one vote needed, displayed a thumbs down and saved Obamacare, which benefits millions in our country.
A true American patriot hero has passed. John McCain was an example of a public policy maker who fought for what he believed in, and had the character dignity to stand up for what was right -- even if he had to oppose some of his colleagues to do so.
Manafort Cohen both lied about their finances cheated the IRS. Can you imagine what #DonTheCon must be hiding in his tax returns when it is well known that the ONLY bank that would lend him money, Deutsche, is notorious for money laundering?
The avg. American struggles to pay his/her taxes but Trump's allies can get by for years cheating the IRS, defrauding banks, laundering millions of $$. Trump is probably hiding his tax returns b/c he's as big a crook fraud as the top people he chose to run his campaign WH.
The high crimes are giving aid and classified information to our enemies (Russia), abusing the pardon, breaking campaign finance laws, working w/ Russians to get "dirt" on political opponents, and coming soon from Special Counsel Mueller, obstruction of justice.
Cohen admitted Trump instructed him to break the law. If it's a crime for Cohen, it's a crime for Trump.  Debates about whether you can indict a president do not excuse Congress from its responsibility to impeach Trump for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes misdemeanors."
Cohen said he would take a bullet for Trump. I guess he never said anything about jail time!
