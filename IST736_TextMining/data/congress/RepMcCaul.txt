I remain dedicated to working with the President — and in a bipartisan fashion with all my colleagues in Congress — on a consistent basis to fix our broken immigration system and create a framework that works for all Americans.
This shutdown has gone on long enough, has hurt patriotic public servants in the process, and only serves to undermine our credibility abroad. It is time to come together. It is time to end this shutdown.
A full solution to end the security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border must include constructing physical barriers, providing the latest technology,  authorizing more boots on the ground, and closing the legal loopholes in our current immigration system.
Today’s announcement exhibits the President's leadership willingness to negotiate a solution to secure our borders end this government shutdown for the American people. I urge Congressional leaders of both parties to accept the President’s proposal and reopen the government.
Happy Birthday to the Leader of @HouseAppropsGOP and fellow Texan, @RepKayGranger.

I fought passionately for this funding following #Harvey I remain committed to ensuring it’s used as intended — for Army Corps projects to mitigate future flooding disasters. Texas families shouldn’t have to choose between border security disaster aid.
Democrats need to put their dishonest talking points away and take their own advice. The American people have demanded action and it’s time to deliver.
Ending the partial shutdown without solving this problem will make the situation worse in the future. Nancy Pelosi, Steny Hoyer, and Chuck Schumer lecture others about putting politics aside and doing what’s best for the country.
It was authorized by the Secure Fence Act in 2006 and supported by Chuck Schumer. This kind of flip flop is proof that the Democrats are just playing politics. Where is their counter offer?
The President has shown good faith by dropping his funding demand from $25 billion to $5.7 billion and for accepting a steel barrier instead of a concrete wall. A similar barrier already exists along parts of the border.
This week, Democratic leaders walked in front of the cameras and said they want border security but refused to compromise at all. This is politics at its worst.
In June, every single Democrat in the House voted against my bill to build a barrier, put more boots on the ground, provide advanced technology, close legal loopholes, and create a permanent fix to DACA. 
There is no question that this is a longstanding national security and humanitarian crisis.Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress are simply un-interested in securing our border and the country is suffering because of it.
Drugs smugglers, violent gangs like MS-13, human traffickers, and even potential terrorists are overwhelming our southern border and infecting our neighborhoods. Families with small children are making the dangerous trek across hundreds of miles and putting their lives at risk.

Today on Labor Day we honor the great American worker, the bedrock of the world’s greatest economy, and the contributions generations of hard working Americans have made to the strength, prosperity, and well-being of our nation. #HappyLaborDay
John McCain believed that “the best thing that can ever be said of anyone is that they served a cause greater than their self-interest.” His 60-year legacy of selfless service to our nation will echo for generations. My full op-ed on Sen. McCain :
Great meeting with @HIDGlobal in Austin about their products, which are some of the best in the world to secure identities. I have always worked to ensure that businesses with the most secure product receive contracts on national security issues. #TX10
I met with officials with the City of Houston to learn about their four-year plan to secure the city from cyber threats. I offered my assistance to the city to help streamline the project as it prepares to host major upcoming events city-wide. #CyberSecurity
I met with @AJCGlobal of Houston about our foreign policy the importance of defending human rights. Specifically we discussed Assad’s humanitarian crisis in Syria HR 380, the legislation I introduced to hold those who conduct or facilitate business with the IRGC accountable.
My prayers are with @SenJohnMcCain and his family. As the true example of an American hero, he was the embodiment of patriotism. I know I join the nation in missing his spirit, determination, and love of our armed forces and our nation. Our country is at loss.
After #HurricaneHarvey I led @HouseHomeland hearings in Washington and in #TX10 about the lessons learned and how we can be better prepared. I also testified before the @Transport committee about the importance of expiditing critical funding for recovery efforts.
In the year since #Harvey we have made tremendous strides in our recovery, but more needs to be done. I stand by willing to help however my office can as we continue to move forward, further recover, and push for infrastructure solutions to mitigate future flooding. #TexasStrong!
One year ago today, #HurricaneHarvey landed on our shores. Following the dreadful days on unprecedented rain and historic flooding, I was on the ground to witness the resolve of my fellow Texans and hear the stories of heroic acts that saved thousands of lives.
Happy birthday to a great #Texan, Congressman John Culberson.

RT @WashTimes: McCaul presses Senate to pass bipartisan cyber and election security legislation #nationalsecurity
Today, @POTUS signed the FY2019 NDAA into law. This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild our nation’s military. We need to ensure that at a moment’s notice, our brave men and women have the tools they need to defend our nation.
Great to have @SecretaryPerry in #TX10 today!
Congratulations to Carla Provost on being selected as the 18th @USBPChief and the first woman to ever lead the U.S. Border Patrol. Best of luck, Chief!
I applaud the administration for taking action to hold Russia accountable for its continued trampling of international law.
I have led efforts in the House to pass bipartisan bills that will protect our digital networks from cyber intruders—nation states, hackers, cybercriminals—relentless in their pursuit to target our election and other critical infrastructure.
