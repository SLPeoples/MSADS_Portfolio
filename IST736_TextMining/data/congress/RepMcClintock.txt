As fire season approaches I am working closely with state and fed officials to make sure all resources are in place to protect our local communities. Joined Agriculture and Interior Secretaries and USDA Interim Chief of Forest Service today at Wildfire Outlook Briefing for 2018.
I am in total agreement with the decision to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal.  My full statement here: 
Gathered this week with leadership of the U. S. Forest Service's Tahoe Basin Management Unit, Tahoe District Fire Chiefs, and Cal Fire to ensure all practical measures are in work to prevent wildfire in the Tahoe Basin.
Over the last ten years, population and inflation have increased a combined 26 percent. Revenues have more than kept pace, increasing 29 percent. The problem is the third number. Spending has grown 46 percent.  
Curbing spending is the only way to control our deficits and ballooning debt.  Without resolute action now, we run the risk of an unstoppable debt spiral and ultimately a sovereign debt crisis. The RSC budget points the way back to solvency and prosperity.
Voted NO on the Omnibus (H.R. 1625 – Consolidated Appropriations Act) this week. Statement on the legislation:

Kudos to the @NatlParkService for dropping its visitor-unfriendly bottled water ban.
Anyone marching under a Confederate or Nazi flag deserves the scorn of #liberty-loving Americans.
Confederate statues should be taken down, but in a lawful way. Lincoln was right: No grievance is a fit object for redress by a mob.
Secession is ultimate rejection of America and rule of law. There are no American heroes in the Confederacy or its modern manifestations.
The bigotry that came to #Charlottesville is a rejection of the very principles on which our nation was founded.
