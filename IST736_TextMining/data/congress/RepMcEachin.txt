I will continue to fight to bring attention to these deleterious health and safety environmental issues and work to ensure they are addressed.
The Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations – and its utter failure to act in the face of dangerous new threats to public health – have endangered the health and well-being of countless Americans.
As a Vice Chair of @SEEC, I was proud to host today’s briefing, in partnership with @Earthjustice, to discuss some of the serious environmental problems faced by minority, low-income, and rural communities across the country.
As a cancer conqueror, I know firsthand how important it is to ensure that colorectal cancer screenings are more affordable and accessible. I am proud to introduce this legislation, which will help reduce the financial barriers to receiving this life-saving procedure.
In honor of Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, I introduced the bipartisan and bicameral 'Removing Barriers to Colorectal Cancer Screening Act of 2019' with @RepDonaldPayne, @RodneyDavis, and @RepMcKinley.
We need to strengthen -- not weaken – the regulations put in place to prevent the potential harms caused by an offshore drilling accident.
These activities can have potentially calamitous consequences for our communities, their economies, and the ecosystems of which they are part.
During today’s @NRDems Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee hearing, I questioned Mr. Doug Morris, Chief of the Office of Offshore Regulatory Programs at @BSEEgov, about the serious concerns offshore drilling poses to the health and safety of our coastal communities.
Thanks to hard work and important partnerships, we have made great strides in cleaning the Bay. More needs to be done and I will continue working to ensure our Bay remains healthy and vibrant for future generations.
I was very excited to participate in the Choose Clean Water Coalition’s seventh annual Chesapeake Bay Day event as the Bay is crucial to transportation, recreation, and the health of local economies in the Commonwealth.
I am humbled to receive this award and I am excited to continue to work in the weeks and months ahead to improve our nation’s water infrastructure and leave our children the healthy, livable world that they deserve to inherit.
Simply put, nothing is more important to public health—or environmental quality—than clean water.
Thanks to my friends @healthylakes for recognizing me as a water champion for my commitment to preserving and protecting our natural resources, especially Virginia’s treasured Chesapeake Bay.

RT @SOlympicsVA: Our SOVA #SOHillDay leadership team just had a great meeting with the office of @RepMcEachin.
In Virginia alone, more than 20 communities have officially voiced their opposition to seismic surveys and offshore drilling, including Virginia Beach and Norfolk – Virginia’s most populous cities. #ProtectOurCoast
I urge the administration to listen to Virginians, who have expressed vehement opposition to all forms of oil and gas exploration off Virginia’s
History has shown us that offshore drilling accidents can irrevocably harm coastal communities’ economies, public health and marine life – and compromise military activities that are important to national security. #ProtectOurCoast #BlockTheBlast
Virginians have too much to lose when we prioritize polluters’ profits over the health and safety of our ocean and coastal communities.
Today, I led a letter in opposition to seismic airgun blasts and offshore drilling off the coast of Virginia that was signed by every Democratic member of our delegation.
I proudly co-sponsored the #FAMILYAct so that we can establish a national paid leave system for Virginians and families across the country.
A national #paidleave policy would shift #caregiving norms and making workplaces more equitable and family friendly.
At some point in our lives, all working people will need access to #paidleave. The #FAMILYAct would set a national standard and advance the FMLA's vision of more equitable and family-friendly workplaces.

Given recent developments, I believe that it is best for the Commonwealth of Virginia if Justin Fairfax dealt with these accusations as a private citizen. He can no longer serve us as the Lieutenant Governor of Virginia.
This week as I began service on the @EnergyCommerce committee, it was clear that the spirit and legacy of @JohnDingell lived on through our work. Rep. John Dingell is a legendary public servant who will be sorely missed.
Thank you @RevYearwood and @Kingdomliving4u for the longstanding partnership and your unwavering commitment to #ActOnClimate.
Minority communities deserve equal representation as we discuss #environmentaljustice solutions.
I have worked hard to ensure that we have more voices of color as we discuss energy and environment issues. That is why I co-founded the United for Climate and Environmental Justice Task Force.
The fact is that communities of color are disproportionately impacted by environmental injustices that can harm their public health and economic livelihoods. Having voices from these communities at the table is critical.
I have worked with @RevYearwood and @Kingdomliving4u throughout my tenure in Congress. Here are two prominent leaders on the front lines in our communities as we fight for #environmentaljustice across the country.

My official statement calling for Northam to resign:
Let us use this 400th anniversary and the entire #BlackHistoryMonth to take every opportunity to recommit ourselves to acknowledging the stain of slavery and racism on our country and take the steps we need to truly find equality for all.
Now in 2019, we continue to see far too many African-Americans struggle from the systemic racism that began 400 years ago in Jamestown.
On this first day of #BlackHistoryMonth, we commemorate the first Africans who were brought here to Virginia as slaves in 1619 - 400 years ago.

I am thrilled to continue fighting #forthepeople under the leadership of Chairman @RepRaulGrijalva as a member of @NRDems. I am proud to now represent the 4th Congressional District on the Energy and Mineral Resources and Oversight and Investigations subcommittees.
I introduced the Election Day Holiday Act w/ @RepAnnaEshoo because we must do all we can to remove barriers to the ballot box for American citizens. The right to vote is sacred and should be  protected. Our democracy depends on this fundamental principle.
The US wind industry just finished the third best quarter in its history, which means the country runs on more affordable, reliable, clean wind energy than ever before. We must invest in #renewableenergy!

We must act on climate now. Not only does climate change threaten public health and life as we know - but it also impacts our national security.
We must continue the fight to protect our one Earth and renew our commitment to strengthening the protections enacted.
I urge this administration to empower the @EPA and @Interior to fulfill their missions to protect our waters, our lands, and all Americans, and stop their relentless attack on the commonsense safeguards enacted to protect us.

The suffering and deprivation we have seen across the country clearly demonstrated that a #shutdown is not the answer to any disagreement.
Contrary to what President Trump said at the end of his speech, a #shutdown should never be the solution or even an option when governing. Everyone must be committed to finding a resolution without threatening or enacting another shutdown.
The President owes these Americans an apology for being hostages to his intransigence.
Fortunately, 800,000 federal workers will soon be back on the job, receiving long overdue paychecks so that they can pay their bills and feed their families.
Negotiating policy differences can be done without closing the government, without depriving dedicated workers of their paychecks, and certainly without depriving Americans of needed services.
President Trump and his Republican colleagues finally recognize the overdue necessity of re-opening the government after the 35th day of the #TrumpShutdown.
