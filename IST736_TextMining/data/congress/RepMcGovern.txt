My full statement on the situation in Sudan here: …
Given the courageous protests now taking place inside in Sudan, it would be unconscionable for the @realDonaldTrump Administration to remove Sudan from the State Sponsor of Terrorism list or provide Khartoum with economic support or additional sanctions relief.
(Ghost houses are harsh detention centers where torture is common.) On Friday, #Bashir imposed a year-long state of emergency.
Over the past several weeks, the people of #Sudan have been protesting economic hardship, and an end to Bashir’s repressive politics. They have been met with excessive violence and mass arrests. Many have been sent to the infamous ghost houses.
For decades, Omar al-Bashir has violated the Sudanese people's basic human rights, supported extremist groups, repressed religious minorities, and stolen his nation's wealth while most of its people live in

We will not sit by as millions face starvation disease. This week, the House will consider a resolution that reasserts Congress’ role over U.S. foreign policy.
Congress should not be complicit in the greatest humanitarian crisis happening in the world today. And @HouseDemocrats new majority will not shirk our responsibilities.
In December, the United States Senate passed a bipartisan resolution to end U.S. support related to this conflict. It is past time that the House of Representatives did the same.
We need to reclaim our role over U.S. foreign policy. Prior Congresses used every legislative trick in the book to prevent this debate. War Powers Resolutions relating to Yemen were even deprivileged – not once, but twice.
More than 22 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance 85,000 children under the age of 5 have already died of hunger and disease.

Great thread from @MassEMA about this weekend’s winter storm. Roads are getting slick — if you have to drive, use caution.
The President totally ignored the crisis he alone has created. All he did was repeat tired talking points, distorted characterizations of asylum seekers old proposals that have been rejected by Republicans Democrats alike.
Instead, what did we hear? Not one word about reopening the government ensuring that 800,000 federal workers get paid for their good work on behalf of the American people.
Democrats are more than willing to negotiate how to strengthen security at our borders and ports of entry, as well as permanent relief for Dreamers and long-term TPS holders.
