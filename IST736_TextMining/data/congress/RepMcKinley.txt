Minutes ago @POTUS signed H.R. 6 the comprehensive, bipartisan opioid package into law. The bill will help expand access to treatment, improve prevention programs, and give law enforcement the tools they need. Simply put, this will save lives.

Great to work with my friend @DonaldNorcross on this important bill. Vital to ensure a skilled workforce.
Happy to help.
Finally, H.R. 5628, the Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act was also included. The AIDD Act will improve access to drug disposal programs for leftover Rx medicine. A majority of opioid users become addicted with pills from friends and family. This will reduce the availability.
Emmett's Law (H.R. 5695) will educate health professionals about information on substance abuse and overdoses they can share with family members. For the story behind this bill watch this video:
H.R. 6 also includes the Alternatives to Opioids (ALTO) Act (H.R. 5197) that we introduced with @BillPascrell. The ALTO Act builds on a successful model used in NJ to encourage alternative pain management in the ER, where many patients are first prescribed addictive medicine.
H.R. 6 includes four bills we have championed. First, the POWER Act (H.R. 5176), which we introduced with @USRepMikeDoyle. It will help reduce repeat overdoses by helping patients get connected with treatment options directly following an overdose.
The Senate just passed major bipartisan opioid legislation -- H.R. 6 is now on its way to be signed into law. This is a significant step in the ongoing fight against this epidemic. It will increase access to treatment, improve prevention, and give law enforcement more tools.
Good discussion with staff @WVUMedicine Chestnut Ridge Center this am. Increasing improving access to treatment for opioid addiction comes up often. Dr. Berry and his team are developing new treatment models and training providers across WV.
You can check out some coverage of our meetings with small businesses in Moundsville yesterday

Met with a number of local small businesses in Moundsville earlier today. Stopped in Hometown Floral Gifts, Ruttenberg's, and several others. Small businesses are vital for our economy and our communities. Lot's of optimism about things turning around in WV.
And Gov. Justice pledged that the additional funds would be allocated to shoring up PEIA and provide for a second round of 5% pay increases.  This is the good news we’ve been working towards.
Economic recovery is surging in WV.  Gov. Justice just announced that increases in personal income and severance taxes have provided $120 million in excess of estimates.  Both are byproducts of federal regulatory reform on coal and gas and the cuts in individual taxes.
WesBanco Arena in Wheeling was rockin’ tonight for the Trump Rally.  He pledged to continue the reforms to regulations and taxes until everyone benefits and confirmed that pre-existing conditions would be included in any healthcare reform.
Proud to support and contribute to this vital legislation. The opioid crisis touches every family and every community. H.R. 6 includes a number of important steps to combat the epidemic.

We are calling on Twitter, Facebook, and all social media sites to focus their resources towards developing a better system to block the illegal sale of opioids on their platforms. This is simply unacceptable, and it shouldn’t take being called out for these companies to act.
Earlier this year, we highlighted this issue for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and we did so again today with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey. Once we brought up examples of criminals using Twitter to conduct opioid sales, they immediately banned those users and took down the ads.
Illegal online pharmacies are using social media to circumvent the law and facilitate the purchase of addictive drugs without a prescription. This issue is particularly hard-hitting for WV, where we have the highest opioid overdose rate in the
