Today was a good day in Washington because the House passed the #ForThePeople Act. I’m proud to be on the right side of history as a cosponsor of this important legislation, which would put our government back in the hands of the American people.
This #InternationalWomensDay, I'm proud to celebrate the record number of women I have the privilege of serving alongside in Congress. Today and everyday, let us recommit ourselves to the fight for equality.
Today, Port of Stockton Director Richard Aschieris I discussed the Port’s future its contributions to our community. It is the 4th busiest port in California employs over 10,000 people. As a member of the Congressional Ports Caucus, I’ll continue to fight for its success.
As a co-chair of the Bipartisan #CampaignFinance Reform Caucus, I am committed to fixing our broken system ending the undue influence of money in our elections. The #ForThePeople Act is a vital step toward restoring the voice of the voters I’m proud to be a cosponsor.
I'm excited to announce the 2019 Congressional Art Competition! If you're a high school student or know a high school student in the 9th Congressional District who has a passion for art, check out my website for more information on how to participate:
I’ve heard from thousands of my constituents, and I’ve stood with Americans across the nation in the fight to restore #NetNeutrality. Today my colleagues and I are proud to introduce legislation to #SaveTheNet.
San Joaquin RTD is an award-winning innovator in meeting the transportation needs of our community. I was honored to join them for the grand opening of the Union Transfer Station.
The new Democratic majority is already moving to develop policies to combat climate change. And across the country, states and cities are enacting their own laws to reduce carbon emissions. For more, check out my piece in @americnhumanist.
Over the past ten years, @USMBDA has secured more than $40 billion in contracts and capital to help minority-owned businesses grow. I'm proud to introduce legislation to ensure we protect the MBDA for future generations of minority business owners.
As I voted in favor of H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112, I thought of those impacted by the Cleveland Elementary School shooting. Gun violence is an epidemic, but we can make our communities safer with common sense gun reforms like these.
Today, @HouseDemocrats are voting to permanently reauthorize #LWCF, protecting millions of acres of lands from mining and saving taxpayers $9 million. This bipartisan package is a win for conservation for our nation’s most iconic treasures.
The president’s heartless cuts will deprive care to millions of women who rely on these clinics for essential health services. This is yet another dangerous decision designed to cater to his ideological
I had a great time at the Stockton Women's Collaborative Black History Program Luncheon. When I come home from DC, it's events like these that re-energize me. As we celebrate Black History Month, it was an honor to recognize four leaders making a difference in our community.
My response to the #FakeTrumpEmergency:
Thank you to @4CDLive for stopping by my DC office this week. We had a great discussion about how we can work together to prioritize higher education, and empower students to achieve their educational goals.
I'm thankful that in @GavinNewsom's first State of the State address, he chose among his priorities to voice opposition to the twin tunnels. Moving forward, I hope the Governor will focus on a comprehensive approach to ensuring a sustainable water
This weekend, the @AmerDentalAssn and the San Joaquin Dental Society joined together to offer free dental care and dental education to children ages 1-17. Thanks to the dental professionals and dental students who volunteered their time at the Give Kids a Smile event in Stockton!
I'm a proud co-sponsor of #HR8. This bipartisan legislation is just commonsense and will make our communities safer.
Today, @EnergyCommerce and @NRDems are holding the House’s first climate change hearing in eight years. Last night, however, the president didn't even mention this pressing issue. We can’t ignore the needs of our planet any longer. Now is the time to #ActOnClimate.

While the president continues to question the science behind climate change, his Director of National Intelligence has no doubt about the danger it poses to our nation and our national security.
My statement on the short-term funding deal to reopen the government. #TrumpCaved
Millions of Americans depend on @NWS's scientific forecasting to stay safe in their jobs and in their everyday lives. The National Weather Service is already understaffed, but thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, most of the 4,200 employees are working without pay. #EndTheShutdown

Today we honor the life legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. From marching for the right to vote to rallying with workers for economic equality – Dr. King fought for justice fairness. As we reflect on his contributions to our nation, we must recommit to continuing his work.
This proposal isn’t a compromise. Once again, the president is trying to leverage a crisis that he created in an attempt to fulfill a campaign promise. This isn’t good policy and it isn’t good
Mr. President, I look "even more forward" to watching you sign any of the 9 bills @HouseDemocrats have already passed to re-open the government. But if you want to continue your temper tantrum, that's certainly your prerogative.
Due to a change in the House calendar, I will need to be in Washington, D.C next week for votes. Unfortunately, this means I have to cancel the open house events on the 23rd and 24th, but they will be rescheduled at a later date.
.@senatemajldr won’t even consider re-opening the government – he’s too busy confirming a coal lobbyist to run the EPA. But, with the majority of EPA employees furloughed, @EPAAWheeler will be pretty lonely. @HouseDemocrats have some bills to fix that.
If you need to sign-up for health insurance, today is the last day of open enrollment in #CA.
I'll be hosting an open house at my Stockton office on January 24th from 4:00 PM - 5:30 PM. Hope to see you there!
Don't forget - open enrollment in #CA is still available until January 15th.
I'll be hosting an open house at my Antioch office on January 23rd from 4:00 PM -5:30 PM. I hope to see you there!
Many Americans rely on their annual tax refund for essential expenses, such as car repairs and medical bills, and the likelihood is that refunds will be delayed. The House has done its job, and now it’s time for the Senate and the president to do theirs.
The president's speech was vacuous, using fear lies to excite his base, but offering no new solutions. While he was fixated on the manufactured crisis at the border, the real crisis played out on our TVs: America is without a leader that is morally capable to lead. #TrumpSpeech
Every day @realDonaldTrump keeps the government closed, America’s small businesses pay the price. From the businesses that serve federal workers to entrepreneurs seeking affordable capital, the #TrumpShutdown is hurting #SmallBiz. #EndTheShutdown
‘I’m proud to shut down this government’ says a man who thrives on chaos and cares not for the people impacted. Let’s bypass partisan warfare and find real solutions to real problems.  #TrumpShutDown
Wishing everyone a safe and happy New Year! I’m looking forward to continuing to work on your behalf to strengthen our community and our country.
Mary and I, along with the rest of my family, want to wish you a Merry Christmas and a safe holiday season. We live in a great country, and we have so much to be thankful for. I’m feeling very optimistic about this coming year.
The inability of the Republican controlled Congress and White House to keep our government funded is a gross display of willful incompetence. The nation can look forward to having a Democratically controlled House to bring order to Washington in 2019. #TrumpShutdown
Tonight, the federal government entered a partial shutdown because a handful of elected officials put their own ideologies before the best interests of all Americans. #TrumpShutdown
Yesterday, we saw the last and dangerous spasm of a dying and dysfunctional Republican Party under the leadership of an incompetent and corrupt president. #TrumpShutdown
They’re willing to shut down the government to avoid challenging the president. But, we weren’t sent to Washington to work for the president. We were sent here to work for the American people. #TrumpShutdown
In the 11th hour, after many compromises had been made in order to produce a robust and essential funding bill, the president pulled the rug out from under us, and House Republicans – a majority of whom supported the bill just hours before – fell in line.
I voted against this legislation, not just because of the inclusion of the excessive border wall funding, but because this is not how our government should function.
Instead, they offered their own version of the bill, which included $5 billion for the president’s wasteful border wall.
Tonight, House Republicans gave in to pressure from the president and jeopardized our government’s stability. The Senate already passed a bipartisan funding measure, but House Republicans refused to bring that bill to the floor.
The #FirstStepAct2018 allows judges more discretion in sentencing certain low-level nonviolent drug offenders, impacting thousands of people in federal prisons️. #CriminalJusticeReform
I had a great time at the Marine recruit holiday gathering this weekend. It’s always inspiring to spend time with the next generation of leaders, especially those who are committed to serving our nation.
Despite assurances from @facebook and directly from Mark Zuckerberg, we continue to see instances of failure to protect consumers’ privacy. It’s clear that Congress must take action.
No mother should be left wondering whether she will be able to see her child again. Shaima’s visa is moving forward, but the president’s discriminatory travel ban remains. So we must continue to fight back against this administration’s divisive
Abdullah Hassan doesn't have much time left just wants to know if he'll be able to see his mother again. I led a letter with @DorisMatsui @RepBarbaraLee asking @StateDept to expedite a decision on his mother's immigration waiver to come to the U.S. 
One year ago, the FCC repealed #NetNeutrality protections and I joined millions of Americans in the fight for a free and open internet. But time is running out. We need 218 signatures on the CRA discharge petition to force a vote on the House Floor.
3 years after the #ParisAgreement, Republicans continue to stand by as the Trump administration repeals critical protections that impact the health of the American public. But I'll keep fighting against these reckless actions. #ActOnClimate

I had the privilege of joining our veterans others in our community for the National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day Ceremony at the Stockton World War II Memorial. As we commemorate this day, let us renew our commitment to stand against tyranny, to defend liberty and democracy.
The internet is an essential tool for education, business, innovation, and free speech. Without #NetNeutralty rules, ISPs can slow content and raise prices on our internet access. We must act on the discharge petition to restore #NetNeutrality.
If the #PublicCharge rule had been in place in 2017, nearly 70% of green card recipients could have been denied green cards. We must say #NoToPublicCharge.
The @FCC’s lack of transparency here is incredibly troubling. It’s been nearly a year-and-a-half since I requested the agency provide server logs related to the alleged DDoS attacks on the #netneutrality docket, and I’m still waiting.
Last night, Mary and I attended the Stockton Menorah Lighting to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah. As we head into the holiday season, let us recommit to come together to help one another and to stand up against hatred in any form.
George H. W. Bush lived a life of service and dedication, both to our nation and to his family. He helped maintain order in uncertain times. Together with his family and all who appreciate his accomplishments I honor the life of a true American patriot.
The #NCA4, a report by 13 federal agencies including @ENERGY, @EPA and @NASA states: “Future impacts and risks from #ClimateChange are directly tied to decisions made in the present.” It’s long past time to #ActOnClimate. #ClimateFriday
Americans across the political spectrum support restoring #NetNeutrality rules, but time is running out. We have less than a month to get 218 signatures on the CRA discharge petition force a vote on the House Floor. On this #NetNeutrality Day of Action, let's keep pushing.
I joined my Democratic colleagues on a series of briefs challenging the president's order to shrink the size of our national monuments - specifically Bears Ears and Grand
The American people - especially Millennials - care about addressing the threat of #climatechange. They want our government to work toward finding solutions for this pressing problem, not to hide from it.
This Thursday, I am joining the #NetNeutrality Day of Action in a final push to restore the free and open internet. Join me in rallying support for the CRA and force a vote on the House Floor.
Mary and I had a great time last night at the Big Chill in Brentwood! It was wonderful to see so many folks in our community enjoying the evening together and having fun on the ice!
Please take a moment to remember those who are spending today away from their loved ones, protecting our country. Sometimes it’s difficult to acknowledge what we have to be thankful for, but it’s easy to appreciate the sacrifice of those who serve our nation. Happy Thanksgiving.
I joined my colleagues on a letter to @EPAAWheeler emphasizing the dangers of replacing the Clean Power Plan - which set robust, forward-thinking standards - with the much weaker ACE Rule. This poses a serious threat to public and environmental health.
Diabetes affects more than 30 million Americans, and 1 in 4 people who have #diabetes don't know that they have it. November is National Diabetes Awareness Month, learn more about diabetes in California and other states here: #ThisIsDiabetes
Outside Washington, #NetNeutrality is not a partisan issue. Americans across the political spectrum overwhelmingly support a free and open internet. There is no excuse to continue to delay a vote. We must pass the CRA and restore these critical protections.
My good friend @boblatta and I have worked on a number of issues over the years, and I'm excited to once again partner with him to co-chair the bipartisan Congressional #WiFi
Last night, I joined my colleagues at an event to support @Everytown. Next Congress, we have the opportunity to pass commonsense gun legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make our communities safer.
Here are a few ways you can help aid the victims of these wildfires.
My thoughts are with those affected by the devastating wildfires raging across northern southern California. Dedicated first responders continue to battle against the blazes, putting their own lives at risk to help save others, but sadly more than 40 lives have been lost. 1/2
Don't forget to drop off your 'Holiday Cards for Our Troops' by this Friday, November 16th, at my Stockton or Antioch office.
On Veterans Day, we honor the men and women in uniform who have served our nation. Today especially, we remember the price paid in WWI - the “War to End all Wars” - which ended 100 years ago. We must continue to give back to all our veterans and their families.
My thoughts go out to the people of Thousand Oaks, and to the families of those we lost in this senseless tragedy. The American people have long called for commonsense reforms to address the gun violence epidemic in our country, and it's time for Congress to answer that call.
Be sure to make your voice heard today! Polls in California are open until 8 PM this evening. If you aren't sure where your polling place is, you can enter your address and find it here:

I was honored to attend the San Joaquin RTD American Public Transportation Association Award Celebration. RTD has been named 2018's Outstanding Public Transportation System and has been providing service to our community for many years. Congratulations and keep up the good work!
I'm proud to receive a score of 100% on @AAUWActionFund's Congressional Voting Record, and to support critical legislation and policies that directly affect women and families.
The #DeltaTunnels would irreparably damage the Delta comes with an exorbitant price tag, but no proof it would improve California’s water sustainability. I led a letter, joined by my colleagues, urging the Delta Stewardship Council to reject the certification of this project.

Great turnout last night at the informational session my office hosted for the military service academies. Lots of bright young men and women interested in applying to these prestigious institutions!
Yesterday, I joined my colleagues and the Korean Consulate General in San Francisco to honor Korean War veterans in our community. Dozens of veterans and their families attended the ceremony where they were presented with the Korean Ambassador for Peace Medal.
It doesn’t matter if you’re Republican, Democrat, or Independent — if Congress doesn’t restore #NetNeutrality, you’ll be paying more to access your favorites sites apps. We need to pass the CRA to restore #NetNeutrality!
Great turnout this weekend for the Stockton Walk to End Alzheimer's. As a proud supporter of the BOLD Act - which would provide critical funding for early detection treatment of Alzheimer’s - I know Congress must commit to more funding for research development.
Thank you for the opportunity to be a part of this important conversation!
It was a privilege to attend a screening of ‘The Longest Road’ - a documentary by my friend Stockton native Richard Campos. The film follows Richard’s work to help Kurdish refugees in Iraq. It’s a powerful inspiring story that I hope everyone will take the time to see.
Americans across the country support restoring #NetNeutrality protections. This is a bipartisan issue. Democrats and Republicans from coast to coast are joining forces to fight for a free and open internet, and we must continue to build bipartisan momentum here in Congress!
A COLA increase of 2.8% is good news, but we need to #ExpandSocialSecurity benefits to keep up with the rising costs for our seniors, like doctor visits prescription medicine. I will fight to #ExpandSocialSecurity to preserve the benefits seniors were promised have earned!
I join our community in mourning the loss remembering the life of Stockton native Alex Spanos. He his wife Faye gave back by investing in improving local education, healthcare, arts programs. His dedication to service has created a lasting impact throughout our community.
For anyone interested in applying to the military service academies, I'll be hosting an informational session on Thursday, October 18th at Stockton’s Ronald McNair High School Theater.
The #ToxicTrump Administration pulled the US out of the #ParisAgreement, abdicating our role as a global leader on #ClimateChange. Now their #DirtyPowerScam is lining up subsidies to keep dirty, inefficient generators operating well past their design life.

#RenewableEnergy industries are expanding and have great potential to grow our economy. I'm proud to introduce legislation that would help prepare our young people to develop and maintain #cleanenergy systems.
Small business owners deserve equal access to the internet so they can grow and thrive. Without #NetNeutrality, small businesses will have to pay extra fees to stay online and compete with big companies. That's why I signed the discharge petition to restore #NetNeutrality.

These indictments make it clear that we must continue to support Director #Mueller’s investigation. Russia made a concerted effort to erode public trust in our democratic process we must utilize all resources to ensure this does't happen in the future.

Thanks to James and Carol from Stockton, who took a few minutes from their day to stop by my office. I always enjoy the opportunity to meet with constituents visiting DC!
Great discussion on the innovative technologies moving healthcare forward. Thanks for the opportunity to be apart of this important conversation!
Great Meeting with @BrianOftedal of the @ECCFPD. Our firefighters sacrifice every day to protect our community, and we must continue to support their important work. That’s why I’m committed to continuing to look for new ways to help our Fire  District at the federal level.
Wishing you and your family a safe and happy #IndependenceDay!
Today I had the privilege of participating in a naturalization ceremony, welcoming our nation’s newest citizens. All have put in tremendous work to reach this goal now they will be a part of an even greater task: helping to write America’s next chapter. Congratulations!
Clean energy is cost effective will provide a better quality of life for students everyone in our community. I was pleased to join the Lodi Unified School District Board of Education members staff for a demonstration of their new electric school bus.
Americans deserve to feel safe in their workplaces, classrooms, churches and other spaces where these heinous and avoidable acts of violence have occurred. Congress has a moral obligation to enact commonsense gun reforms now. 2/2
Today our nation grieves for the lives lost at the hands of a gunman who was able to purchase a weapon legally, despite glaring warning signs that he should not have been allowed to do so. 1/2

Today’s SCOTUS decision has dealt a major blow to public employees their ability to collectively bargain. Unions have fought for higher wages, better benefits, safer working conditions.  We must continue to fight for the principles that built the American middle-class.

Three years ago, marriage equality became the law of the land, but there is still work to be done. The Equality Act would extend existing civil rights protections to #LGBTQ people, prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. #EqualityForward
Access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a right. That's why I signed the discharge petition and will continue to fight to reverse the @FCC's disastrous repeal of #NetNeutrality protections. #SaveTheInternet
Women have a right to accurate and unbiased information about their healthcare options. Today’s SCOTUS decision in #NIFLAvBecerra opens the door for misleading and inaccurate information to be given freely to women in need of health services. #EndTheLies
The Supreme Court’s decision to uphold President Trump’s travel ban is a direct contrast to the founding principles of our nation. This ruling is an endorsement of discriminatory policies of the past, and does not represent our values. #NoMuslimBanEver
Kicking off the second meeting of the Bipartisan #CampaignFinance Reform Caucus with @usapromise, @takebackorg and Fix it America.
Mary and I had a great time at the Town of Discovery Bay’s 20th Anniversary Celebration this weekend. Thanks to the dynamic leadership of the Board of Directors, the town is leading the county in sustainability while maintaining its small-town charm.

Five years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, but there is a solution. Congress can #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act.
