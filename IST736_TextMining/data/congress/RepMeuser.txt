This is a reasonable, responsible compromise. If Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are serious about wanting to reopen the government, now is the time for them to come to the table, negotiate and reach an agreement to end the shutdown and secure the border.
What a day! Wonderful to see so many Pennsylvanians making the trip to DC today to show their support for #ProLife values.

I’ve been hearing every day from the people of my district in Pennsylvania: do our jobs. Secure the border. Compromise. Put partisanship aside and get things done. Reopen the government. And build a wall securing the most vulnerable parts of the southern border.
Two weeks after the start of the #116thCongress, House Democratic leadership continues to refuse to come to the table, negotiate a compromise, secure our borders and put an end to the shutdown.
Last year @CBP seized  282,000 pounds of cocaine  248,000 pounds of methamphetamine 6,500 pounds of heroin  2,400 pounds of fentanylThis is the reality we face at our southern border. 2/2
Some facts about the crisis at our southern border: 90% of heroin ravaging PA families comes across our southern border 17,000 adults w/ criminal records were apprehended at the border last yr. Law enforcement arrested 6,000 individuals affiliated w/ violent gangs1/2

We have asked Democratic leadership to come to the table and negotiate in good faith. So far, they’ve refused.
Important op-ed from @DeptVetAffairs Sec. Wilkie on progress we're making to prevent suicide among our nation's vets:
A jarring statistic -- opioid addiction is ravaging too many PA families. Addressing this epidemic is among my top priorities.
I’ve received hundreds of calls to my office urging us to follow the plan offered by Homeland Security experts to secure our border, build a barrier where needed, enforce our immigration laws, and do our jobs.
My friend @RepHalRogers and I made a friendly wager over the @PennStateFball / @UKFootball Citrus Bowl. Sadly the Nittany Lions' loss meant I had to deliver a case of Yuengling -- but I did come away with a consolation prize.
Anyone responsibly and objectively looking at these facts would conclude that we have a crisis at the border, and that action must be taken to address it.
