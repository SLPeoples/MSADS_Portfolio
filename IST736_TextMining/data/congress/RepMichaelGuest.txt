Proud to introduce a bill that would improve our nat. security strategies to combat terrorism build a stronger defense system for the American people. Happy to use my background in law enforcement to introduce my first bill, the Terrorist Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act.
This week, I introduced my first bill–the Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act–that will add to the training coordination received by federal, state, local, tribal law enforcement agencies in preparation of terrorist activity
I’m very proud of our two Senate Youth Program attendees, Ruben Banks Kennedy Guest. Ruben is applying to military academies Kennedy will be attending @msstate in September. Both of you worked very hard to be here I look forward to watching your future achievements.

This morning at the Committee on Homeland Security, we are discussing the growing humanitarian security crisis at our SW border with @SecNielsen as the number of illegal immigrants crossing our border reaches an 11-year high. Open border policies are failing the American people
I will continue to call for this important piece of legislation – the Born Alive Abortion Protection Act – to be voted on in the House. We must give a voice to the unborn and protect the lives of children who survive abortions from further harm.
I’m voting no on H.R. 1 to protect the integrity of our campaigns and to protect your tax dollars!
A new Democratic-sponsored bill advocates taking your tax dollars and giving them to campaigns of politicians that you might not support. This costly bill could give politicians access to billions of dollars each year to pay political consultants and run TV ads.
I made one last stop in Lincoln County to meet with local leaders, including my friend Chancery Clerk Tillmon Bishop, before I head back to DC tomorrow. It’s been great traveling the district the past few days, I’m ready to get back to work on Capitol Hill for the people of MS.

Today, I voted against a Democratic authored bill that would punish law-abiding citizens by reducing their ability to defend themselves. This bill–H.R. 8–trades our Second Amendment rights for a false sense of security and does nothing to address the core causes of mass violence.
A secure border means: 1) fewer drugs entering our country; 2) a stronger immigration system; 3) less human trafficking. Make no mistake, securing our border is an issue of both national security and human rights.
I met with members of the American Legion today to discuss veteran priorities in the 116th Congress. We owe our veterans the benefits they deserve for their service to our country, and I plan to continue to support our troops and veterans both abroad and at home.

I’ll be on @WMOX this morning, so if you’re in the Meridian area tune into 1010 AM to listen.
I stand with Congressman Scalise in the belief that Congress should not be passing bills that make it harder for law abiding citizens to defend themselves.
I was disappointed that my Democratic colleagues refused to allow @SteveScalise to testify regarding gun violence.  I encourage them to read his written account regarding the attack on his life and the effect it had on him and his family.
@VolunteerYall @RepTrentKelly @BennieGThompson Great to see y'all. Thanks so much for stopping by.
Although El Chapo will likely spend the rest of his days in prison, his Sinaloa Cartel will retain its network of drug smugglers. We need increased border security to stop these cartels from profiting off the smuggling sale of drugs in our communities.

Israel is one of our closest allies in the Middle East and it’s important that we maintain this strong alliance for the prosperity of both of our nations. Congress must continue to support Israel and the Jewish community both home and abroad.

There’s nothing quite like the Mississippi Rodeo with good friends, @AndyGipsonForMS and @PhilipGunnMS. Thanks for all your work to make this great event happen!
We need additional border security – including a physical barrier – to protect our communities from these dangerous narcotics.
In 2017, 91 percent of heroin analyzed in the U.S. came from to Mexico, 93 percent of the cocaine could be traced back to Columbia, and the amount of methamphetamine produced in Mexico that was analyzed in the U.S. could range as high as 97 percent.
We had a great week in Washington. Haley and I heard our President’s encouraging words in his State of the Union, I continued to be a voice for our unborn children, and I gave my first speech on the floor on the importance of securing our southwest border.
In case you missed it, @realDonaldTrump called for Congress and the American people to adopt a spirit of compromise in his State of the Union address. I’m proud to echo his message of unity and cooperation – together, we can build a bright future for the American people.
I also signed on to @GOPLeader's bill that would prohibit abortion providers from taking the life of children born alive during abortions. We must fight for their right to life.
If we are to remain a nation that values innocent life, we must never advance policies that lead to abortion on demand. Today, I cosponsored a bill that would make permanent the prohibition of the use of taxpayer funds for abortion services – including in Obamacare.

Congress can work together with the @WhiteHouse to achieve bipartisan legislation that reinvigorates our expansive infrastructure system. New roads, bridges, ports, and utilities means higher economic growth, more jobs, and better trade. #SOTU
Do you agree with @realDonaldTrump that more should be done to end the crisis on our Southwest Border?
Drugs are being manufactured, smuggled, and sold by transnational crime organizations in our communities. They are profiting off addiction, and we need additional border security – including a physical barrier – to curb the flow of these dangerous drugs into our community. #SOTU
I agree with @realDonaldTrump to allow individuals who want to help us build a strong future for America to enter our country legally. #SOTU

Congress must do more to keep these drugs from entering our country with common sense border security measures, including a physical barrier along our SW border.
Over $1 million of cocaine was taken off the streets of my hometown thanks to our men and women in law enforcement.
Fentanyl is now the most dangerous street-level drug we have ever seen in the United States, accounting for more deaths in 2017 than meth and heroine combined. Protecting our communities from these dangerous drugs starts with securing our SW border.
Earlier today, I signed a letter encouraging the Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Committee to take the right steps to end the crisis at our southwest border by providing funds for technology, manpower, and a physical barrier. Read more here:
Thank you for your kind words, General Rice. I will continue to support our men and women in military and promote the values that have made our great nation strong.
Mississippians deserve to have access to healthcare services in their communities. It was a pleasure to visit the Covington County Hospital in Collins today and meet with CEO Gregg Gibbes to discuss policy issues affecting rural hospitals.
Abortion at anytime is immoral, but a bill allowing abortions when a woman is showing physical signs of labor is unconscionable. We must continue to be a voice for our unborn children and oppose any such bill introduced in Congress.
I’m honored to join so many talented Freshmen Members on @HouseHomeland, including @RepMarkGreen, @RepDanCrenshaw, @RepVanTaylor, and @RepJohnJoyce. I look forward to working with them and our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to keep our country safe.
