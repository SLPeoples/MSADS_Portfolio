Thrilled to announce our first #CA49 Constituent of the Month! Shelby Jacobs, from Oceanside, had a huge role in NASA’s Apollo program, but never got the recognition he deserves until now. He’s a role model for young people in our community and I am proud to share his story.
This #InternationalWomensDay let’s recognize the record number of women serving in the House. We would be nowhere without their leadership.
Important message on this #InternationalWomensDay ️Thank you for everything you do @RepKatiePorter.
The #ForThePeople Act is simple. We want big money out of politics, clean and fair elections, and public servants to serve the public instead of special interests. It’s not that hard.
Met Captain America @ChrisEvans yesterday. He’s fighting Thanos. I’m fighting climate change. We’re both trying to save the planet.
There’s nothing partisan about ending the scourge of domestic violence and sexual assault. That’s why Congress is taking bipartisan action today to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act to support survivors. #VAWA
The Trump Administration should not be secretly tracking law-abiding journalists, lawyers, and advocates to stop them from simply doing their jobs. This is a stunning abuse of power and potentially unconstitutional.
I came to Washington to help change the way this place works. That’s why I cosponsored the #ForThePeople Act.  With #HR1, we are tackling the culture of corruption and bringing more accountability to our political process.
I’m participating in a hearing on the Administration’s push for more offshore drilling, which I know is strongly opposed by the folks I represent. We must protect our oceans and California's beautiful coastline. Tune into the hearing here:
This morning I heard from @VFWHQ about their priorities and how we can work together to support America’s veterans. As the grandson of a World War II veteran, I am honored to work with the VFW and so many other important veteran service organizations.
PSA: We’re having our first “Mornings with Mike” in the Washington office tomorrow! Any and all constituents visiting in Washington are welcome to stop by and say hello.Not in town? Keep an eye out for details on similar events in #CA49 starting soon.
People in #CA49 elected me to bring transparency and accountability to Washington, and that’s what they’re going to get when we pass the #ForThePeople Act this week.
I was honored to welcome the @SDVetsCoalition to my Washington office today. They do critically important work to serve local veterans and their families, and I look forward to working with them as a member of @VetAffairsDems.
RT @RepKatieHill: Counting down the days until @HouseDemocrats pass the most important package of democracy reforms, ethics standards, and…
I was elected to help end the culture of corruption in Washington, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do with #HR1. I’m proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation and I can’t wait to vote on it this week. #ForThePeople
Part of #WomensHistoryMonth is recognizing the work we still have to do to secure full equality and opportunity for women in our society. That’s why I was proud to join @Alyssa_Milano in pushing for ratification of the #EqualRightsAmendment.
Chrissy and I are thinking of the families and victims in Lee County, Alabama. I know all Americans stand with Alabamans today and we will continue to stand with them in the recovery effort.
I am honored to announce that my office is hiring a wounded or disabled veteran for a two-year paid fellowship in our Oceanside district office. For more info and to apply, go to:
Here’s what the president’s #FakeEmergency could cost Camp Pendleton in #CA49:- $47 million for drinking water infrastructure upgrades- $49 million for amphibious vehicle maintenance and storage- $10+ million for Marines’ training
Curious what a real climate scientist would say to the president’s new climate change denier, William Happer? We got some answers in yesterday's @NRDems hearing. Watch:
Renae, from Carlsbad, was enjoying a concert when she was forced to dodge bullets at the Las Vegas shooting. Lonna, from Vista, tragically lost her sister as a result of gun violence in my district. My vote for #HR8 today will be made with their stories in my heart.
RT @RepDean: Today the House makes history. We will hold a vote on #HR8, a bipartisan bill to expand background checks help save lives. M…
I will support every effort to defund the White House’s fake panel on climate change. Any group denying settled climate science and spreading disinformation can only do harm.
Just voted to reject the president’s #FakeEmergency. It’s an abuse of power that could rip nearly $124 million from Camp Pendleton for critical military construction projects. This isn’t about partisanship, it’s about patriotism.
The bipartisan #PublicLands package is a huge win #ForThePeople, particularly for everyone back home who enjoys our beautiful San Onofre and San Clemente State Beaches. I’m voting for this legislation so future generations can enjoy our public lands too. #LWCF ��
Welcomed @SDHungerCo to Washington today! Their critical work helps feed some of our most vulnerable neighbors, and I am so grateful for everything they do. #HungerFreeSD
I’m heading to the House floor now to highlight the stories of two constituents who were tragically impacted by gun violence. Watch here:
Proud to stand with @GabbyGiffords, @RepThompson, and other colleagues ahead of our historic vote this week to pass the bipartisan Background Checks Act. Common sense gun violence prevention measures like this are long overdue, and we're not done fighting for progress. #HR8
Glad I had the opportunity to meet with @GavinNewsom and my California colleagues to discuss wildfire relief efforts and the need to address the nuclear waste at San Onofre. A lot of important work ahead of us but we’re making progress together.
I'm thrilled to announce that the @CityofOceanside is set to receive $2.6 million in federal funding for critical water infrastructure projects that will expand its supply of locally-sourced drinking water. Learn more here:
The president thinks his #FakeEmergency will make us safer, but it does the opposite.He’s stealing billions from crucial military projects  – including potentially $124 million from Camp Pendleton – that ensure our troops have the training they need.
I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. That's exactly what I'm going to do tomorrow when I vote to reject the president's #FakeEmergency.
RT @JoaquinCastrotx: The #FakeEmergency goes beyond partisanship. Democrats Republicans alike swore an oath to protect defend the Const…
Checking in here with another weekly update. It was a busy week with events across the district and a tour of the San Ysidro Port of Entry this afternoon.
RT @RepJuanVargas: .@LeaderHoyer, @RepScottPeters, @RepMikeLevin, I are at the San Ysidro Port of Entry being briefed by @CBP on how they…
I also continue to have serious concerns about this Administration’s asylum policies, which do not live up to our nation’s principles.
Just visited the San Ysidro Port of Entry at our border with Mexico and saw recent upgrades to the facility. We need to invest at our ports of entry with the technology and personnel that will actually secure our border — not waste taxpayer money on an ineffective wall.
I am heading down to the San Ysidro Port of Entry later today with @LeaderHoyer, @RepScottPeters, and @RepJuanVargas to see the asylum process for ourselves. One thing is clear: the way this Administration has treated asylum seekers does not represent our American values.
Proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution to terminate the president’s #FakeTrumpEmergency
Visited @BDandCo’s Medication Management Solutions HQ in San Diego yesterday to learn more about their work to improve public health around the world. I'll continue to support businesses like theirs that create good-paying jobs right here in Southern California.
Joined local business leaders at the @SDRegionalEDC today to discuss how we can work together to grow our regional economy and ensure that all communities benefit from our economic success.
This is stunning. The president picked a climate change denier who thinks pollution is good for the planet to lead a panel studying climate change.  He once said “warming and increased CO2 will be good for mankind.” This is a new low in the Administration's war on science.
Visited @thermofisher’s Life Sciences Solutions headquarters in Carlsbad yesterday. The facility there employs over 2,000 people throughout the region, and I will continue to support high-tech businesses like it that provide good-paying, 21st century jobs in STEM fields.
Glad to welcome members of the local @MomsDemand chapter to my Oceanside office today. We must do more to address the epidemic of gun violence in this country, and I look forward to voting on #HR8, a bill I co-sponsored to require background checks on all gun sales.
.@UCSanDiego adds enormous value to our region and I will do everything I can in Congress to support their students and research.
I also learned more about @UCSanDiego's Veteran Entrepreneur Initiative, a program designed to help local veterans develop the skills and tools necessary to launch successful startup businesses.
Yesterday, I had the opportunity to meet with @UCSanDiego administrators, faculty, and students about the critically important research they do – particularly at @Scripps_Ocean to study the impacts of climate change.
We must do more to address the substance abuse crisis, which has devastated families and communities across the country. I’m proud to join this group of lawmakers who are going to do everything we can to combat this epidemic.
Here’s another update on my work for you this week and my response to President Trump’s #FakeEmergency declaration:
RT @LCVoters: Clean energy and environmental champion @RepMikeLevin: “Climate change is the most important issue of our time.” @T_Sittenfel…
The president’s #FakeEmergency declaration is a clear abuse of power and likely unconstitutional. I will be proud to cosponsor this resolution.
My statement on the president’s national emergency declaration and bipartisan legislation to prevent another government shutdown:
My mom's parents came to the US to build a better future for my family. And I want to tell every immigrant in this country today: you are welcome here and you are a valued part of our country. #ToImmigrantsWithLove
Happy #ValentinesDay! Today is a good day to remember, love always trumps hate.
One year ago today, 17 innocent lives were taken in Parkland in yet another horrific, senseless act of gun violence.  Let's remember them and honor their lives by recommitting to #EndGunViolence and finally pass commonsense gun safety laws. #MSDStrong
Welcomed @CityofOceanside Mayor Peter Weiss and other local officials to my Washington office today! Looking forward to working with them to deliver federal resources for the region and support all Oceanside residents.
I know the Southern Californians I represent have had enough of Washington’s #CultureOfCorruption. That’s why I joined @HouseDemocrats in introducing #HR1 – our plan to end the dominance of big money in our politics. #ForThePeople
RT @NitaLowey: The agreement struck this week by the House and the Senate is the best possible deal to #KeepGovernmentOpen and working for…
Dealing with climate change in a bold and aggressive way is no fairy tale – doing nothing and expecting this problem to take care of itself is the real fairy tale. #ActOnClimate
We have a responsibility to support a just transition for fossil fuel workers to renewable energy jobs as we combat climate change. That was my message in today’s @NRDems hearing, and that’s what I’ll work toward as a cosponsor of the #GreenNewDeal.
According to NASA, the last five years were the hottest on record. According to Pew Research, climate change is seen as the #1 international threat. According to the president, it snowed so everything is fine. Let’s listen to the experts and #ActOnClimate now.
We need more #LatinasInTech -- women are less than 1/4 of the STEM workforce, and Latinas are only 2%.  This International Day of Women Girls in Science, let’s celebrate them and push for more diversity in STEM industries. #WomenInScience
I support @GavinNewsom’s redeployment of CA National Guard troops to focus on countering drugs and gangs across the state instead of participating in @realDonaldTrump’s manufactured crisis.
It was an honor to speak at the North County Veterans Stand Down event today and listen to our local veterans. No veteran who has sacrificed for our country should be homeless, and this event is a critical tool to help them get back on their feet.
Here’s another weekly update, touching on @realDonaldTrump’s out of touch #SOTU address, the first Congressional hearing on climate change in nearly a decade, my appointment to the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, and our roll out of the #GreenNewDeal. Check it out:
Yesterday I had the chance to highlight the impact climate change is having on my constituents. Rising sea levels and stronger storms have caused coastal erosion in beach towns like San Clemente and Dana Point. This crisis is real. We must #ActOnClimate now.
Honored to join so many strong leaders as a member of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. Together, we will answer the American people’s call to #ActOnClimate with the energy urgency that was missing under Republican control.
RT @HispanicCaucus: #ClimateChange is one of the greatest threats to the future security of our country. @HispanicCaucus is proud to have…
I am proud to stand with @SenMarkey, @AOC, and many others in unveiling the #GreenNewDeal today. Climate change is the most pressing issue of our time, and we need a bold, comprehensive agenda to address this crisis.
I’m honored to serve on the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. I have two young children at home, and this is about leaving the planet better for them than how I found it.
In the first Congressional hearing on climate change in many years, I had one simple message: We must #ActOnClimate with bold measures like a #GreenNewDeal.Thank you to @RepRaulGrijalva and @NRDems for focusing on this critically important issue.
The highly divisive policies @realDonaldTrump offered at the #SOTU didn’t match his brief nod toward compromise. I’m willing to work with him, but it has to be a two-way street.
Dear @realDonaldTrump:Listen to your own scientists.CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.
Thinking of @RepDebDingell @JohnDingell today. Two extraordinary public servants who I admire.
Today is a big day. I’m participating in the first Congressional hearing on climate change in a decade. Led by @RepRaulGrijalva, @NRDems are ready to #ActOnClimate. Tune in here:
While I am hopeful that the president’s calls tonight for bipartisanship were made in good faith, the substance of his address was woefully out of touch with the current state of our union.Read my full response to the #SOTU address here:
Checking in with my #SOTU guest, Lucero Sanchez, before the main event. We’re hoping @realDonaldTrump will stop using hateful rhetoric toward immigrants and talk about the need for a path to citizenship for Dreamers.
My #StateOfTheUnion guest is Lucero Sanchez, a #Dreamer and UCSD student who hasn’t let @realDonaldTrump’s hateful rhetoric toward Hispanic communities stop her from being civically active.  Her story is #OurHispanicSOTU. Read more here:

Climate change is real. It is happening now. And we must do more to address it.
Rosa Parks changed the course of history and pushed us to fight racial injustice everywhere. On what would have been her 106th birthday, we can honor her legacy by working #ForThePeople to achieve the equality she fought for. #BlackHistoryMonth
Excited to announce my guest for the State of the Union! Lucero Sanchez is a Dreamer and UCSD student who is working to drive civic participation in her community. @realDonaldTrump could learn a thing or two about the enormous value immigrants add to our country if he met Lucero.
Checking in with another weekly update here. Lots of exciting news about my position as Chair of the House Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity and more! Watch here:

Had a very productive meeting with @OfficialSDMAC in our Oceanside office today. Ready to get to work for the military families in San Diego and across the 49th.
ICYMI: I’m going to Chair the House @VetAffairsDems Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity! A lot of work ahead to ensure veterans have access to quality education, jobs, housing, and more.
Yesterday, I voted to give federal workers a raise. After years of pay freezes and shutdowns, they deserve a little relief.Instead, the president is using those workers as political pawns and threatening another #TrumpShutdown.It's clear who is really working #ForThePeople.
Proud to cosponsor the #PaycheckFairness Act to help women finally secure #equalpay for equal work. Thank you for your leadership @rosadelauro!
#SocialSecurity is fundamental to the economic stability of seniors, people who experience disabilities, and so many more. Proud to help introduce a bill today to strengthen the program. #Secure2100
So glad to welcome my friend @Alyssa_Milano to our Washington office today. She’s leading the charge with @PattyArquette, @RepMaloney and @RepSpeier to ratify the #EqualRightsAmendment, and I am standing right behind them in that fight. We need the #ERANow.
Joined @RepJohnLarson and other colleagues this morning to help introduce the #SocialSecurity 2100 Act. It’s long past time that we increase benefits and strengthen the program for future generations. #Secure2100

It is unacceptable that so many veterans struggle to find work and succeed in civilian life. We must do better by the men and women who have sacrificed for our country. I look forward to working with Chairman @RepMarkTakano and members of both parties to deliver for our veterans.
BIG NEWS: I am going to serve as Chair of the House Veterans’ Affairs Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity. As the grandson of a World War II veteran and the Representative for @MCIWPendletonCA, it is an honor to serve in this role.
Apparently the president’s nominee for EPA Administrator hasn’t been totally briefed on the National Climate Assessment. We wrote him a letter with a simple message: READ THE REPORT. DO YOUR JOB.
Was glad to sign this letter to @EPAAWheeler urging him to read the Fourth National Climate Assessment and study its devastating findings. Any EPA Administrator must understand the urgent need to #ActOnClimate.
Met this morning with my friend @fred_guttenberg, an incredibly strong person whose daughter Jaime was murdered in Parkland, Florida last year. He has dedicated his life to the cause of gun safety, and I am proud to stand with him.
RT @sdut: Congressman Levin forms a task force to study moving, storing San Onofre's nuclear waste

We cannot allow the status quo at San Onofre to continue indefinitely. That’s why I have launched a task force to help formulate solutions to the grave safety challenges we face.
ICYMI: I held my first monthly public town hall on Saturday and tons of constituents turned out with great questions. Head over to my Facebook page to watch the whole thing if you missed it!
Today #WeRemember the millions of lives that were taken in the name of anti-semitism and bigotry. We must recommit ourselves to rooting out hatred wherever it rears its ugly head. #HolocaustMemorialDay
Watch LIVE at 3pm as I host my first monthly town hall. Hundreds of constituents are joining me to hear about the work I'm doing for them in Washington and to ask me about the issues they're most concerned about. Tune in!
Happy to be on @KUSINews this morning to speak about our monthly Town Hall meetings and avoiding future government shutdowns. 
Encouraging sign that President Trump has decided to temporarily end his shutdown. I talk about the votes we took to #EndTheShutdown and share more exciting news in my weekly update. Watch here:
More big news: I’m going to serve on the Natural Resources Committee! Hugely important for all of my constituents who live along our beautiful California coastline.  Very excited to work with Committee Chair @RepRaulGrijalva to expand clean energy and protect our land water.
Workers who are critical to our homeland security like Coast Guard servicemembers, TSA agents, and air traffic controllers are being forced to work with the added stress of not being paid. That is flat out wrong.
I just voted for the TENTH TIME to #EndTheShutdown and get federal workers the paychecks they desperately need. Read my full statement on today’s vote:

46 years ago today, women secured the constitutionally protected right to make their own reproductive health care decisions. #RoeVWade was a landmark case, but we must keep fighting to protect a woman’s right to choose. #Roe46
The #TrumpShutdown has now lasted a full month. A MONTH. That’s a month without income for hundreds of thousands of families.  We need to #EndTheShutdown, and then discuss the best way to increase smart border security.
Transgender troops have served with honor and sacrificed for our freedom. There is no question that today’s #SCOTUS ruling will be an ugly stain on our nation’s history. #ProtectTransTroops
Just spoke with an air traffic controller who is working without pay and driving for Uber on the side to make ends meet. This is insane.
Honored to speak at the North County San Diego @NAACP Community Prayer Breakfast this morning. Can think of no better way to celebrate #MLKDay2019 and highlight the work we still have to do to achieve the full equality that Dr. King fought for.
Today, we celebrate the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and recommit to the values he preached. We have much more work to do to achieve the level of justice and equality he strived for, but we won’t stop fighting. #MLKDay2019
Was proud to join millions of people all over the world in the #WomensMarch2019. The #WomensWave is here.
Just sat down with @Alex_Presha to talk about President Trump’s speech and what I’m doing to #EndTheShutdown. Keep an eye out for the interview on @NBCSanDiego tonight!
Before we consider any immigration and border security proposal, we must first re-open the government and get federal workers the paychecks they deserve. Read my full statement on President Trump's proposal:
ICYMI: Check out my op-ed in the @sdut highlighting the work I’m doing to #EndTheShutdown and fight #ForThePeople.
Yesterday, I sent a letter to @NRCgov raising concerns over its investigation into apparent violations at San Onofre. The violations had the potential to be disastrous for the surrounding communities and are extremely concerning.
Between 80-90% of the worst drugs being smuggled into the U.S. are seized at official ports of entry, NOT areas between the ports of entry where @realDonaldTrump wants to build his wasteful border wall.
Here’s our first official Weekly Update — this week, I discuss our work to #EndTheShutdown and have an exciting announcement on my assignment to the Veterans Affairs Committee!
This is among the closest evidence of obstruction of justice that we’ve seen yet, and Congress must get to the bottom of it.
Today, Members of Congress were supposed to be on their way to visit U.S. troops overseas. Instead, @realDonaldTrump attempted to cancel the trip then leaked commercial travel plans, putting their lives at risk.  His temper tantrum is making us less safe, and it needs to end.

I’m heading to the House floor now to call on @senatemajldr to #EndTheShutdown and stop holding federal workers hostage over the president's expensive, ineffective border wall. Tune in:
It is unacceptable that hard-working Americans who earn the federal minimum wage cannot afford to make ends meet. I’m proud to cosponsor the #RaiseTheWage Act to help change that. #Fightfor15
Earlier today I joined my freshmen colleagues in looking for @senatemajldr. Just want to give him our letter asking him to #EndTheShutdown. Couldn’t find him, but we’re still trying. #WheresMitch
Big news: I’m hosting my first public town hall a week from Saturday!  I want to hear about your top concerns and answer any questions you might have. Register here and join us at Oceanside High School on the 26th:
Just joined my freshman colleagues outside of the Senate to demand @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell follow our lead and allow a vote on bipartisan legislation to #EndTheShutdown.
FYI: President Trump’s EPA referred fewer pollution cases for criminal prosecution in 2018 than at any time in the past THIRTY YEARS. We demand an EPA that actually believes in environmental protection.
Closely following the William Barr hearing today. It’s critical that the AG represent the interests of the American people, not the interests of @realDonaldTrump. If Barr cannot defend the rule of law, no matter the political cost, he should not be AG.
Apparently the president thinks we’re on vacation. Actually, we’re here in Washington voting again to re-open the government while he’s off in New Orleans (or Nashville, there seems to be some confusion). #EndTheShutdown
Glad to see my community supporting those impacted by the shutdown, but it’s past time to end this. Senate Republicans President Trump need to accept the bipartisan legislation passed by the House to re-open the government. #EndTheShutdown
Thankful for all of the credit unions stepping up and providing interest-free loans to folks impacted by the shutdown. Now we have to #EndTheShutdown and get people back to work.
This is ridiculous. Now the president wants to turn almost $2.5 billion in funding for California infrastructure into a slush fund for his ineffective and expensive border wall. Not on my watch.
Yesterday, I shared the stories of constituents who have been hurt by the #TrumpShutdown, and I called on the president to accept the bipartisan funding bills passed by the House. Let’s #EndTheShutdown now.
Tune in LIVE- I'll be talking about the #TrumpShutdown and its impact on individuals and families in the 49th district
Today I marched alongside our nation's workers to demand @realDonaldTrump end this shutdown. Stop holding federal workers hostage and #StopTheShutdown
It’s day 20 of the #TrumpShutdown. All we’re asking the president to do is accept Senate Republican legislation to re-open the government while we continue to debate border security. #EndTheShutdown
Proud to stand with my California colleagues against Trump’s hateful and vindictive statement about California’s wildfires. We won’t sit idly by while he attacks our state.
The president just called a foreign adversary “more honorable” than American leaders.This is a new low from the so-called ‘America First’ president.

Joined Southern California air traffic controllers who shared their stories about being furloughed and are just looking to go back to work. The #TrumpShutdown needs to end.
First full week in Congress and I’m not wasting any time working to protect California’s coastline. Proud to cosponsor two bills to ban future offshore oil and gas leasing along our coast.
Dear @realDonaldTrump:Your lack of knowledge regarding forest management is appalling, as is your blind bias against the State of California.These were overwhelmingly federal lands, managed under federal law.Also, more rakes won’t fix climate change.
It’s imperative that we take bold action to combat #ClimateChange and create the clean energy jobs of the future. That’s why I’m so excited to join @SEEC. We’re ready to #ActOnClimate!
We must do more to end the epidemic of gun violence in this country, and today we are. I am proud to join @RepThompson and @GabbyGiffords in introducing #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.
Just got off the phone with a constituent who has been furloughed from @USFWS. Heard about dozens of her colleagues who live paycheck to paycheck and don’t know what they’re going to do. The message was clear: the #TrumpShutdown needs to end. Now.
The #TrumpShutdown has jeopardized food stamps for millions of Americans, and now the Admin won’t say if it can use reserve funds to protect the program. That’s unacceptable.  @realDonaldTrump can end this now by accepting the bipartisan funding bills we’ve already passed.
RT @RepSarbanes: We promised the American people that if elected, we would fight corruption and clean up Washington. We are keeping that pr…
Trump thinks landlords will be “nice and easy” to federal workers impacted by his shutdown. He couldn’t be more out of touch.Share how the #TrumpShutdown is impacting you by using #ShutdownStories and #CA49 if you’re in the district.
While 800,000 federal employees go unpaid, Trump's staff is going to get a $10,000 raise. Unbelievable.
The House already passed bipartisan funding bills - including funding for border security. Mitch McConnell needs to bring these bills up for a vote, and @realDonaldTrump needs to sign them. They need to stop holding workers' pay hostage.
We are on day 15 of the #TrumpShutdown. Next week, some federal employees will start missing paychecks. They're wondering how they're going to make rent. This needs to end. Now.
Wanted to provide a quick update from my first full day in Congress. Focused on ending the #TrumpShutdown, passing the #WeThePeople Act, and delivering results for folks back home.

Just voted to end the #TrumpShutdown. Republicans have supported the bills we passed today to fund the government. Now it's time for the Senate and @realDonaldTrump to do the right thing.
Humbled and honored to take the oath of office today. Family and friends traveled all the way from California to join me, and I am so grateful for their support. Thank you!
Today's the big day! People in the 49th and all across the country called for new representation that shared their values, and now they're going to get it. I'm ready to get to work.
Must-read article exposing how @realDonaldTrump's EPA is making Americans sick. They put corporate special interests ahead of our health and well-being. Unacceptable. They're going to hear from me in the new Congress.
I commend the bipartisan work Democrats and Republicans did to unanimously pass a government funding plan in the Senate. But the president preferred a shutdown, and now we're here. Find out how the #TrumpShutdown could impact YOU:
The president said he would be "proud" to shut the government down. Well, the #TrumpShutdown is here. @realDonaldTrump, are you "proud" that over 420,000 federal employees - including law enforcement - are working without pay this holiday season?
If the president decides to shut the government down over his immoral and ineffective border wall, he’s going to hurt people right here in the 49th. @realDonaldTrump, do the right thing.
Six years since Sandy Hook.The current Congress has done nothing to address the epidemic of gun violence.The new Congress is coming soon.  The time has come to act.I’m honored to be a new member of the Congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.
I’ve never been prouder to be a Californian.-We protect our environment.-We’re a hub of innovation.-We believe in voting rights.-We celebrate our diversity.-We aren’t afraid to stand up to this administration.I couldn’t be prouder to be representing #CA49 in Congress.
@arjav_rawal Just temporarily.  Moving to official account soon.
