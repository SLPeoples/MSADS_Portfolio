The American people have spoken and I agree. That’s why I will vote for next week’s House resolution calling on #DOJ to release the final #Mueller report to the public.
This is a disgusting ban that should be seen as not only an attack on the #transgender community, but an attack on any brave man or woman who chooses to serve our country in uniform. #ProtectTransTroops
Last Congress, I introduced the MAR-A-LAGO Act to require disclosure of visitor logs at any location the president regularly conducts business. We deserve to know who has the president’s ear and who is wielding their influence in our democracy.
This week, I cosponsored the #ReproRightsAreHumanRights Act requiring the @StateDept to resume reporting info on #reprorights in annual human rights reports.
Legitimate businesses of any kind should never be forced to operate on a cash-only basis. That’s why I cosponsored the #SAFEBankingAct to protect banks from federal action so they can provide services to legal cannabis businesses in states like IL.
Happy #InternationalWomensDay! We should take the time to honor celebrate the women in our lives for their sacrifices accomplishments. We must also remember that there’s much more we must do to advance gender equality here around the world. #IWD2019
Today, the House passed #HR1. This historic legislation makes voting easier, reforms big money in politics, strengthens ethics laws. It includes 2 of my bills to help combat election hacking to provide public access to Congressionally mandated reports.
My message to Trump his associates on @hardball last night: We have the gavels. There's nothing to block us from the truth.
TONIGHT: I’ll join @HardballChris at approx. 7:15 ET to discuss Michael Cohen pardon talks more. Tune in.
Today, I was proud to cosponsor the reintroduction of the Violence Against Women Act. This bill fulfills our responsibility to protect all Americans by expanding protections for every woman against domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking. #VAWA
Starting at 1:30pm ET: Watch me chair the @AppropsDems FSGG subcommittee as we examine the #SupremeCourt’s FY 2020 budget request with Associate Justices Kagan Alito. Livestream here:
I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of this important and timely legislation. Presidential pardons should never be used as a tool for personal benefit.
"You will see a drop like you've never seen before." - Trump campaign promise to reduce the #trade deficit. So much for trade wars being "easy to win."
Free public access to Congressionally mandated reports is a service that taxpayers deserve. That's why I"m proud that #HR1 includes my provision to do just that. Learn more about this and other provisions in the #ForThePeopleAct you may have missed here:
Today, as Chairman of #FSGG Approps, I sent a letter to @USGSA demanding documents that are currently being withheld by the Trump Admin relating to the decision to block the longstanding plan to relocate the FBI headquarters, located across the street from Trump Hotel in D.C.
Democracies are only as strong as the fairness reliability of their #elections. Last year, I secured $380M in grants to better protect our elections from hacking, but more is needed to ensure that our democratic process remains free from interference.
Botanical science research is an essential element in our fight against climate change, which makes this legislation so important.
We are living in a time when the work of environmental scientists is becoming increasingly important for the health of our planet and the people, animals, and plants that call it home.
Today, I reintroduced the bipartisan Botanical Sciences Native Plant Materials Research, Restoration, Promotion Act, to support the growth of the #BotanicalSciences field to encourage the use of native #plants.
And this is why Trump must listen to his own intelligence experts instead of taking a murderous dictator "at his word."
Hope she didn’t think I was the mascot in the photo! Always happy to inspire the next generation of #hockey (mascot) fans.
President Trump really is the self-described "king of debt" he claims to be. Too bad our children and grandchildren will be paying that #debt for decades to come.
High school students stopped by my office, on behalf of the @TouretteAssn, to raise awareness for Tourette Syndrome (TS). Nearly 30,000 children in IL have TS or another Tic Disorder. We must do more to support greater understanding, support and social acceptance. #Rally4Tourette
I cannot emphasize enough how momentous this is. We need to build on these successes that means Congress providing increased funding for #HIV/#AIDS research so that one day we can find a cure to this terrible disease, which has claimed too many of our friends and loved ones.
My thoughts continue to be with all those affected by the deadly tornadoes in #Alabama over the weekend. Thank you to all the people who are providing aid throughout communities devastated by these storms.
The Trump Admin continually prioritizes corporate profits over the wellbeing of the American people. The unprecedented shrinking of a national monument in coordination with uranium miners is beyond the pale, but it is sadly not surprising under this President.
Happy #PulaskiDay, Chicago! Today we celebrate the birth of the #Polish hero, Casimir Pulaski, for his contributions to the American Revolution as the "father of the calvary."

Trump praising Putin on the campaign trail while trying to secure a real estate deal in Moscow is just one reason to examine if Trump has been compromised financially. The President should have nothing to worry about if he has nothing to hide.
More evidence that Trump’s #TradeWars are a self-inflicted wound costing American consumers over $1 billion a month.
Next week the House will vote on #HR1 to make it easier to vote, reign in big money, enact tougher ethics rules. I’m proud it includes two of my bills: one to help combat election hacking the other to make govt reports more assessable to the public.
I’m proud to support H.R. 4. We should be doing everything we can to tear down the barriers created to restrict people of their basic right to vote. #RestoreTheVOTE
Promoting your family business while in office is unethical and the textbook example of conflict of interest. This is the sort of everyday Trump behavior we cannot normalize.
Great to meet with the residents of Plymouth Place in La Grange this afternoon. I always value the time I spend visiting my constituents sharing the latest on what I'm working on back in Washington.
This morning, I was proud to stand with #PlannedParenthood in Chicago to speak out against Trump’s domestic gag rule. It’s a despicable policy that will deprive millions of Americans access to the #healthcare they depend on. #NoGagRule
The President was caught lying again to the American people blatantly jeopardized our #nationalsecurity for the benefit of his son-in-law. I’m committed to working with supporting the @OversightDems investigation into WH security clearances.
The American people deserve much better than a former coal lobbyist with a track record of enabling polluters over protecting public health—Despite Wheeler, I'll continue fighting for #climate action to ensure clean water, air, and land for every one.

Today, the House will vote on the Bipartisan #BackgroundChecks Act of 2019, a long-overdue #gunviolence prevention measure that will undoubtedly save lives. This is the kind of common-sense policy that the new Democratic majority will continue to pursue.
For the past 2 years, I’ve done my best to sound the alarm on the vulnerabilities in our country's election systems. Today, I held a hearing on the remaining concerns that plague our election infrastructure the steps we must take to harden our defenses. Watch below ↓

FACT: Over 80% of illegal drugs come through legal checkpoints. #FAKENationalEmergency
If President Trump thinks Congress will allow him to waste our constituents’ hard-earned tax dollars on a wall we don’t need or usurp the authority the Founding Fathers gave to us through the power of the purse, he is mistaken. #FakeTrumpEmergency
#Illinois added +1,300 #solar jobs in 2018, giving it the 13th-largest solar workforce in the U.S.! Pleased to see our state doing what's needed to prioritize clean #energy create well-paying jobs in the process.
He shouldn't, given his Admin's claim that tweets = official statements.My #COVFEFEAct amends the Presidential Records Act to include the term “social media” as a documentary material, ensuring additional preservation of POTUS communication to promote government accountability.
One year ago, we witnessed the deadliest high school shooting in US history. I urge my colleagues to follow the example of #Parkland students who refuse to accept these tragic events as business as usual. We must support their efforts with common-sense #gunviolence legislation.
Proud to join my #Illinois colleagues in urging the Agency for Toxic Substances Diseases Registry to perform an #EtO exposure assessment across the US, including in Lake County, IL. The public has a right to know what is in the air they breathe.

#GlobalGagRule is horribly detrimental to the wellbeing of over 4 million Americans who receive #healthcare through #TitleX. In order to promote access to quality care, we should work to improve provider-patient relationships—not undermine them. #NoGagRule
The closure of a section of #LakeShoreDrive due to extremely hazardous conditions is an alarming wake up call, but it’s not the first. As Vice Chair of the #Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I'll work to make sure our #infrastructure needs are met. Lives depend on it.
Sadly, America’s infrastructure has earned its D+ rating from @ASCETweets. Our #transportation system has made us the most prosperous powerful nation in the world, but decades of underfunding crucial maintenance have crippled the infrastructure we rely on for continued growth.
You work hard to give your kids a better chance than you had. My dad, Bill, was the epitome of this philosophy. His version of the American Dream inspired me, and I am forever grateful for his example.Thank you all for the outpouring of love support.

President Trump and his inner circle have a serious problem with the truth, but House Democrats are seeking it at every turn. As founder of the #Transparency Caucus, I believe the American people have a right to see their president's #taxreturns.
