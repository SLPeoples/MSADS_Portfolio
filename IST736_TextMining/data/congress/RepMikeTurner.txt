Great to chat yesterday with @ChrisEvans about why I got into politics, my efforts to protect child custody rights of our nation's servicemembers, and @NATO's importance in an increasingly complex world of threats.
I wish Heather all the best in her future endeavors. She will be deeply missed. Hopefully, someday we can see Heather Wilson as the first female Secretary of Defense.
.@SecAFOfficial Heather Wilson is a dear friend and former colleague of mine. The importance of her incredible work in @usairforce cannot be overstated. It is not surprising to me that Heather would be sought out by other organizations looking for her strong leadership.

As I have voiced to this Administration repeatedly, I strongly believe securing our border should not be done at the expense of previously funded military construction projects.
However, I believe it is a dangerous precedent for the President to be forced to declare a national emergency because Congress refuses to provide necessary funding to protect our country.
I supported this funding deal as a step towards securing our border, which we absolutely must do.

I strongly supported passage of the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019 in the House today. Civilian federal employees go above and beyond to serve our country and our community. They have earned our support. My full statement:
