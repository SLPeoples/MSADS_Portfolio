It was wonderful to see your group this morning and talk about my efforts in Congress to build a new lock at the Soo Locks, fund the GLRI, and stop Asian carp. The Great Lakes are vital to Michigan and we need to protect them for future generations.

John and Debbie have been wonderful friends, and while we mourn his passing, we also celebrate his extraordinary American life and his distinguished public service to the people of Michigan and the nation.
John Dingell was a dedicated public servant who was deeply committed to his principles, his constituents, the House of Representatives, his sports teams, and his beloved Debbie. As the longest serving member of Congress he was a part of historic moments for more than six decades.
We're glad you're on here! You and Debbie have our prayers and support.

President Trump and Ambassador Haley have used strong sanctions to bring North Korea to the negotiating table. Now sanctions can be used again to get a better deal with Iran and stop it from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
The nuclear deal gave Iran, the leading state-sponsor of terrorism, billions of dollars and it used that money to terrorize people around the world. Iran's aggression hostility towards America Israel is why I rejected this bad deal when Pres. Obama proposed it 3 years ago.
