It is a shame that Nancy Pelosi and the House Democrats chose this week to pass a watered-down anti-hate resolution that didn’t even directly condemn Rep. Ilhan Omar’s anti-Semitic comments. Our country and its diverse people deserve better. #WeeklyWrapUp
Today's vote is a gross overreach of power by Democrats and an incredible show of constitutional overreach. I strongly reject the bill and its principles.
Apparently their idea of ‘free and fair elections’ doles out taxpayer money to fund political campaigns, creates security vulnerabilities in the voter registration process, limits voters free speech, and allows the federal government to meddle in the states’ election process.
By bringing H.R. 1 to a vote, Washington Democrats have defined their big plans to keep the #swamp swampy.

On average, 20 #veterans die by suicide each day. Even one is too many. I applaud @POTUS for his efforts to lower that number by creating a task force within the @DeptVetAffairs to help veterans after they’ve returned home.
It was great to sit on a panel at @CPAC tonight to discuss why conservatives should embrace tribal sovereignty and how the Trump Administration is working with Native Americans to protect tribal sovereignty.
I’ve always said that the most important part of any negotiation is knowing when to walk away. I’m proud to see @POTUS hold his ground in meetings with Kim Jong Un and leave a deal on the table—if it isn’t the best possible deal for the American people.

@POTUS' message to the American people was abundantly clear. We cannot ignore the facts any longer. There is a #humanitarian #nationalsecurity crisis at our country’s #southernborder.
