House passage of the bipartisan lands package with the Methow Valley provision represents a victory for the local community in North Central WA. The Methow Headwaters is a natural wonder and is central to the region’s thriving recreational economy. #WA04

BREAKING: Great news for #WA04. The House just voted to my legislation to authorize the next phase of the Yakima Basin Integrated Plan. The bill now heads to @POTUS for signature into law.
RT @RepPeteStauber: Tonight, I spoke on the House Floor to outline the harmful impact the Green New Deal would have on Minnesota. Watch my…
Tonight, I look forward to hearing from my friends and colleagues in the Congressional @WesternCaucus on why the #GreenNewDeal would be catastrophic for their constituents and what we should really be prioritizing in order to continue America’s energy independence dominance.
Not once is the word “hydropower” mentioned in the legislation, and the “Frequently Asked Questions” document released to accompany the introduction of the #GreenNewDeal stated that “the plan is to transition off of nuclear…”
It also comes from our use of nuclear power. The Columbia Generating Station, which is also in the 4th Congressional District I represent, is the only nuclear power plant in the greater Northwest region. It, too, provides clean, reliable power for the Pacific Northwest.
Nearly 70% of WA's power comes from hydropower, a clean, renewable, reliable, and affordable source of baseload energy.
The great State of Washington consistently ranks at the top of the list of states with the cleanest energy production--Because of strong reliance on our incredible system of hydroelectric dams, many of which are in my Congressional District along the Columbia and Snake Rivers.
By expanding our federal bureaucracy far beyond anything we have ever seen in history and undermining the federalist principles our country was founded upon in the Constitution, the #GreenNewDeal would jeopardize the future of America as we know it.
This so-called “deal” calls for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero in only 10 years—one independent estimate led by a team of Stanford engineers suggests it would cost our nation at least $7 trillion to convert all of America’s power to renewable power.
I’m leading a Special Order on the House Floor alongside my @WesternCaucus colleagues to discuss a reckless, misguided, and radical proposal recently introduced by many of my Democrat colleagues: the #GreenNewDeal. Follow live here:

This is a debate that goes beyond partisan politics. This is about the value our society places on newborn children. 3/3
I am deeply disappointed that the U.S. Senate – and senator from Washington state – could not come to unanimous agreement to approve legislation to require medical care for newborn children. 2/3
It doesn’t matter how they have entered this world; providing medical care for babies who have just been born is a human rights issue. The recent remarks made by the governor of Virginia show the need to take a stand against infanticide. 1/3
