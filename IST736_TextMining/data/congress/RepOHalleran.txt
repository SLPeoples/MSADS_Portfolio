I want to see greater transparency at every level of govt, end the outsized influence mega-donors have thru dark money campaign contributions, find bipartisan solutions to challenges our communities face. Read my goals for #AZ01 in the new Congress:
Tomorrow, my staff is in Window Rock hosting #AZ01 mobile office hours to assist you w/ issues you may be having with a federal agency, such as Social Security, Medicare, veterans benefits. Contact my Flagstaff office to schedule an appt at the Navajo Nation VA tomorrow.
Everyday, scammers target #AZ01 families in an attempt to take their hard-earned savings. The Social Security Administration is warning Americans about a recent uptick in fraudulent calls; be aware and protect your family and your savings from scams.
Before going back to DC to address the shutdown, I held #AZ01 office hours to meet directly w/ constituents. Hardworking AZ families are being affected by partisan gridlock; we have a responsibility to end it get these Arizonans back to work before they miss another paycheck.
Yesterday, it was my honor to join Americans across #AZ01 in celebrating the life of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His legacy and his contributions towards equality continue to inspire us all to fight injustice in our communities.
Tragedies like those that occurred during the Phoenix VA scandal should never occur again. I cosponsored the Phoenix VA Congressional Oversight Act to ensure that veterans receive the care they deserve and the VA is held accountable. #AZ01
Tribal communities are facing devastating effects as a result of the government shutdown, esp in accessing health care. It is our duty to come together to end this shutdown so that these communities, communities across #AZ01, do not continue to suffer.
Due to the ongoing government shutdown, I have had to postpone two upcoming town hall meetings in Casa Grande and Oro Valley. Keep an eye on my social media accounts, or subscribe to my e-newsletter to stay updated when I reschedule these events. #AZ01

This Saturday, I'm hosting open office hours at my Flagstaff office in #AZ01. Contact my office to schedule an appointment between 9:30 am and 11:30 am. I look forward to hearing from you about issues impacting you and your family.
Years of cuts to public ed have resulted in low teacher pay, crumbling schools, teachers paying for basic supplies w/ their own money. W/ @RepJahanaHayes, I introduced H.Res. 58, to support higher teacher pay call for greater investment in public ed.
In the 28 days since the shutdown began, I have: Cosponsored legislation to ensure federal employees receive backpay Voted 8 times to reopen the government Hosted a town hall to hear from #AZ01 families  Refused salary until we reopen the government

This week, I honored the life of former Navajo Nation President Milton Bluehouse who passed away this week. He dedicated his life to serving his community of Ganado, AZ and the Navajo Nation, and he will be remembered for his commitment to his people. #AZ01
#AZ01 vets have served our country, and it is our responsibility to ensure they have the best care when they return home. If you are a Vet federal employee currently furloughed, read more to learn about VA services available to you during the shutdown:
RT @DavidMandel_: Bringing authenticity to learning - this is real life! Thank you @RepOHalleran for spending time with �s.
#AZ01 families are struggling because politicians would rather play political games with their jobs livelihoods than do their job. It's shameful, it should never happen in the greatest country on Earth.We must find a way to end this shutdown ensure it never happens again.

Navajo Code Talker Alfred Newman bravely served our nation, I was saddened to hear of his passing. The Code Talkers saved the lives of thousands of American troops. My prayers are with his family, loved ones, and community as they mourn his passing and celebrate his life. #AZ01
I cosponsored the Federal Employee Retroactive Pay Fairness Act to ensure that federal employees receive compensation for missed pay during a government shutdown. These hardworking #AZ01 families shouldn't suffer because of partisan gridlock bureaucratic red tape in Washington.
Tomorrow morning, my #AZ01 staff is in Springerville bringing constituent services to you. Stop by the Springerville Town Hall from 10 am to 1 pm to speak to a caseworker about issues you may be having with a federal agency.
This shutdown continues to hurt #AZ01 federal employees. I've sponsored cosponsored bills that aim to hold lawmakers accountable, both by freezing pay requiring the Congressional Budget Office to submit a daily report on the cost of all shutdowns.
