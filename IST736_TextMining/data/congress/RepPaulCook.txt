Proud to have Colby serving in my office!
The House just passed S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act. It now goes to the President for his signature. When it becomes law, it'll be the most comprehensive public lands bill to pass Congress in over a decade.
@cynthia_hayes I'm sorry to hear about the problems you've been encountering. We're looking into the technical issues on that page, thank you for letting us know. My Tour Coordinator has reached out to you through email. Please call my office at (202)-225-5861 if you have any further questions.
Earlier today, the Senate passed a critical public lands bill that includes three pieces of my legislation. When it becomes law, this will be the most comprehensive public lands legislation to pass Congress in over a decade.
Just finished watching President Trump’s #SOTU. Here are my thoughts:
RT @rollcall: House Republicans’ No. 3 leader wants the Iowa Republican gone
@CBluy Cheryl, I agree; Steve Knight is a good man and a great friend of mine. My statement was referring to Steve King, a Congressman from Iowa with a long history of racist statements and behavior, not Steve Knight.
Whether deriding racial minorities at home or cavorting with Nazis and white supremacists abroad, Rep. Steve King brings dishonor to himself, the party of Abraham Lincoln, and his nation. We must reconsider whether Mr. King has the moral authority to continue serving in Congress.
America has lost a true statesman. President Bush spent his entire life in service to our nation. He was a naval aviator, a Congressman, Ambassador, CIA Chief, Vice President, and President. We will never forget his steadfast leadership and unwavering commitment to our nation.
Wishing you all a safe and Happy Thanksgiving!
It was an honor to participate in the 243rd U.S. Marine Corps Birthday Cake Cutting Ceremony this morning. Semper Fi!
Yesterday's horrific terror attack in Pennsylvania, shows why it's critical that we fight hatred wherever we see it. All Americans should be concerned about any rise in Anti-Semitism. America stands with the victims and their families during this tragic time.
Never forget.
I’m saddened to learn of the passing of Senator John McCain. He was a true American Hero who dedicated his life to serving our country.  My deepest condolences to Cindy McCain and his entire family.

Today, my bill, HR 857, passed unanimously in the House. The bill protects recreational and OHV areas, makes crucial expansions to our national park lands, and represents a consensus on how to manage our public lands in the California desert.
