Now, after two embarrassing examples of Republicans using Motions to Recommit effectively, Democrats are trying to rewrite the rules.
When Republicans took the majority in 1995, they guaranteed the “Motion to Recommit” – a procedural tool used to give the House one final opportunity to amend a bill –  was protected despite the fact that it would benefit Democrats, who used it more than 350 times.

Unfortunately, over the last three weeks of negotiations Democrats have shown an unwillingness to support measures that properly secure the #border, and as a result, the bill voted on tonight falls short of meeting that goal. That is why I voted no.
