@FBI 23% of gun transfers to a prohibited purchaser in 2017 involved a history of domestic violence or a restraining order. 6,004 checks that year were denied after the 3-day waiting period. #HR1112 closes this loophole and gives law enforcement the time they need to keep us safe.
.@FBI analysis of the current NICS background check system shows 3 business days can be too little time to determine if someone has a violent history and needs to be stopped from buying a gun. #HR1112 gives them the time they need to conduct a safe, thorough investigation.
I’m honored to receive @theNEUAC’s Extra Mile Award. It’s not an exaggeration to say #LIHEAP is saving lives. As long as I am in Congress, I will keep fighting to make sure this essential program and the people it helps get the support they need and deserve.
Closing these gun loopholes makes a difference! More than 80% of firearms used for criminal purposes were obtained without a background check: #HR8
Universal background checks are also popular -- some 90% of Americans support closing the loopholes on gun purchases: #HR8
Background checks work: our current system has stopped more than 3 million convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers from obtaining firearms. #HR8

U.S. military leaders and our intelligence community keep telling us that climate change and its consequences are a major national security threat. President Trump continues to look for ways to ignore this reality and his duty to act.
Critical forecasting happens at our @NWSAlbany office. As the climate crisis grows, @NWS forecasting will be even more vital. 3-4 years of training to do this job but severe staffing shortages a 35-day shutdown left jobs unfilled folks being thrown in straight out of college.
.@realDonaldTrump failed to convince Mexico, the American people or Congress to pay for his massive, misguided border wall. Now he's working feverishly to undermine the rule of law that has long protected our American republic. I'm signing on to end this #FakeEmergency now.
This president is declaring an emergency over a crisis that doesn’t exist, even saying today that he ‘didn’t need to do this’. Meanwhile illegal border crossings continue their long downward trend from already historic lows. #FakeTrumpEmergency
If he chooses to continue this foolishness, it would only prove that, given the chance to listen to the people and govern with reason and common sense, this President prefers to run head-first into his own wall.
Whatever he chooses to do from here, Congress and the American people have been absolutely clear with the President that he is alone in this misguided quest to build a vast ineffective border wall.
I'm dubious about some of this agreement, but that's compromise. In the end, this deal funds important priorities for our national security economy, resolves uncertainty for vital agencies and workers, and should finally end the threat of another pointless government shutdown.

In the words of former longtime New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan: “Everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own facts.” President Trump wants us to forget the facts and who we are as a people. Thankfully we, the people, disagree.
This week and next we will be offering legislation to reopen those agencies one at a time to help ensure that home and business loans, tax refunds and other important services continue to be available to the American people.There's really only one person standing in the way.
The House of Representatives reached bipartisan agreement last week in a vote to reopen federal agencies the President shut down and to restore paychecks to 800,000 workers. The week before, the Senate voted 100-0 to keep the government open. We are still working to find a way.
@DeptVetAffairs We also believe the symbol of our nation should be our Statue of Liberty, not a massive coast-to-coast border wall.
@DeptVetAffairs Fact: Democrats support strong borders oppose illegal immigration. We believe the best way to improve our security is to upgrade our ports of entry and invest in 21st century technology to address unauthorized crossings, and have long stood for comprehensive immigration reform.
@DeptVetAffairs Fact: President Trump has said numerous times during his presidency that he would like to shut down the government to build his wall, and said just before the current shutdown that he would proud to own this one too.
Fact: Mexico isn’t paying for this wall. $5 billion from taxpayers should fix real problems e.g.- Rebuild Flint’s water system 89 others- Modernize @DeptVetAffairs record system- 2x funding for mental health substance use programs- Cover 1.4 million Americans via Medicaid
Fact: The American people don’t want a border wall. It’s a 5th century solution to a 21st century problem.
Fact: Illegal immigration in the U.S. has been falling for years, including from Mexico. @CBP data shows that in FY 2017 border apprehensions hit their lowest level in four decades.
President Trump has repeatedly misled and even outright lied to the American people about immigration and immigrants. We have tried to negotiate in good faith. He has proven untrustworthy.
Building walls doesn’t solve real immigration issues: - Most illegal drugs come through ports- Most undocumented people in the country overstay visas and never cross the border illegally- Refugees aren’t terrorists, they are the victims of terrorists
Applicants for asylum are typically required to wear ankle monitors and work closely with caseworkers to ensure they show up for their asylum hearing. When done in a thoughtful, responsible way, their court appearance rate is at or near 100%
The people seeking asylum here are desperate victims of gang and cartel violence who often present themselves to U.S. authorities legally. More than half are children or families with children
If there is a security and humanitarian crisis at our Southern border today, it has resulted from failure, mismanagement and inhumane treatment by this President and his Administration.
This #TrumpShutdown has hit critical national security agencies including the Department of Homeland Security, Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection, FBI and Drug Enforcement Agency, even the immigration courts responsible for ruling on deportations.
First, this needless government shutdown is already creating a drag on the economy, stopping countless home and business loans and paychecks for 800,000 federal workers, including 14,367 New Yorkers.
A few things to keep in mind as President Trump continues his fiction-filled push to keep the government closed and force taxpayers to build his ineffective border wall1/

H.R.1 includes overdue electoral reforms that make it easier to vote including automatic voter registration, voting by mail early voting, as well as reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act and safeguarding our elections by modernizing voting systems ending partisan redistricting.

Last night Democrats in the House voted to stand with 800,000 federal workers and end the #TrumpShutdown. Less than a month ago, a Republican-led Senate voted 100-0 to keep the government open. There is no excuse for Congress or President Trump to keep punishing these families.

...and some 14,360 New Yorkers tasked with ensuring the safety, security well-being of the American people–are working without a paycheck with no end in sight. This is no way to govern. Today the American people get new leadership and new voices in Congress. Let's get to work.
President Trump forced our country into a shutdown with no plan to get us out of this mess. Now hundreds of thousands of families–including those of FBI, DEA, Secret Service border patrol agents and customs officers, Forest Service firefighters, food safety inspectors...
A new Congress gets sworn in today. Time to end this President’s tantrum-driven government shutdown and turn the page on an era of Republican-led governance by crisis that has done incredible harm to our national security and economic stability. #TrumpShutdown

Based on this estimate, some 14,360 New Yorkers have been sent home or asked to work in their federal public service jobs without pay during this #TrumpShutdown. 12 days and counting.
To all who are celebrating today, may kindness, peace and love fill your homes and your hearts. Merry Christmas!
.@RealDonaldTrump 10 days ago: “I am proud to shut down the government for border security”A #TrumpShutdown will force 800,000+ federal employees including more than 50,000 at @DHSgov to go without pay over the holidays. That doesn’t make us safer it’s nothing to be proud of.
Proud of my home state of New York for continuing to lead on clean energy action—100% carbon neutral electricity by 2040. White House, Congress our federal gov't need to invest in solutions that reduce carbon pollution across all sectors of our

No matter where you stand on immigration, a child dying in our custody is unacceptable un-American. This kind of careless, heartless response is beneath us. Congress needs to investigate and hold @CBP and the President accountable for this horrifying treatment of the innocent.
Today marks one year since the FCC repealed #NetNeutrality. During that time, millions of Americans have voiced their strong support for restoring #NetNeutrality - and it's time for Congress to listen. I will continue to fight for the free and open Internet!
The attack on Pearl Harbor came 77 years ago today, killing 2,335 American service members and 68 civilians, and wounding 1,178 others. Today we honor and remember the sacrifice of those who risked everything on that dark day, and all the days after.
Congratulations Luigi!
Proud to remember recognize WWII Navy veteran Armand J. Marion at today’s Albany County Honor-a-Veteran Ceremony. I was humbled to deliver a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to Armand’s children, grandchildren great grandchild honoring his commitment to community country.
We no longer have time to debate settled science. Climate change will cause massive economic and health harm to Americans in every region and industry. Heavy costs have already started hitting millions of Americans across every state. #ClimateFriday
Yearly costs from #ClimateChange could exceed $100 BILLION in the energy, agriculture health sectors by the end of the century. The White House tried to bury this finding last week, putting politics over the health and prosperity of the American people. #ClimateFriday
Great interview!
While you were enjoying precious time with loved ones, the @WhiteHouse quietly released a report on the painful costs we face from #climatechangeMark my words: when the new Congress is sworn in and we have the power to do it, the House will #ActOnClimate
