Proud to announce the passage of #HR1 today as the first of many steps to clean up the chaos and corruption in Washington and make sure our government works #ForThePeople.
Glad to have the support of 108 colleagues as Congress looks to address the cannabis banking issue. Today 47 states plus the District of Columbia – representing 97.7% of the population – have legalized some form of adult recreational, medical or limited-medical use of marijuana.
Nearly 25 years ago, Congress enacted the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act in the fight to end domestic violence in America. Let's reauthorize the #VAWA to ensure all survivors have access to the resources and safety they deserve.
After the first-ever congressional hearing on #cannabis banking, I'm reintroducing the bipartisan #SAFEBanking Act to allow marijuana-related businesses access to the banking system. Congress needs to act to reduce risks for employees, businesses communities across the country.

Federal workers are not political pawns. That's why I'm cosponsoring @RepBrendanBoyle's HR 809 which provides for an automatic 90-day continuing resolution if there's a lapse in gov't funding. The jobs and livelihoods of federal workers should never be held hostage again.
