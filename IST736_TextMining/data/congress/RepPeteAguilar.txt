While we reflect on the progress that's been made, we must also remember that there's still work to be done before we reach true equality. I'm honored to serve alongside a historic number of women in this Congress who are up to the challenge. #IWD2019
I was proud to join my @HouseDemocrats colleagues in passing #HR1, historic legislation to clean up the #CultureOfCorruption in Washington and restore our democracy #ForThePeople.
California is in the midst of a housing crisis, and @realDonaldTrump's shutdown earlier this year made a bad problem worse. Today I joined my @AppropsDems colleagues to hear from housing experts about how we can find solutions to address the affordable housing shortage.

Proud to support @JoaquinCastrotx's resolution to terminate the president's unconstitutional emergency declaration. Congress is a co-equal branch of government and will hold this president accountable, whether he likes it or not.
Our democracy works best when it works for everyone. Today I joined @HouseAdm_Dems and @staceyabrams to learn more about how we can fight voter suppression and expand access to the ballot box #ForThePeople.
The president wants to raid funding for our military to fulfill his campaign promise of building a wall. Congress is a co-equal branch of government, and the White House can expect @HouseDemocrats to push back against this unconstitutional power grab. #FakeTrumpEmergency
Proud to be a part of this group working to #KeepGovernmentOpen.
The president’s inability to fulfill his campaign promise of building a wall does not constitute a national emergency. Using an emergency declaration to go around Congress undermines the will of the American people and is an unacceptable case of executive overreach.

Our job was to reach a deal, not deliver a win for @realDonaldTrump. I’m proud that we were able to come to an agreement that secures our borders, reflects our values, and keeps the government open.
Proud to announce this federal funding to provide resources to individuals and families throughout our region who need it most. This grant will help us work toward our goal of ending homelessness in the Inland Empire.
While wealthy corporations are enjoying their massive tax breaks, working families in communities like ours are getting left behind by the GOP tax plan. If only someone could have seen this coming. �
John Dingell’s lifetime of service helped drive a century of progress in America. This is a heartbreaking loss for the entire country, and my thoughts are with my friend @RepDebDingell during this difficult time.
Our bipartisan bill will not only expand environmental conservation, it will also create jobs in the Inland Empire. Proud to have worked with @RepPaulCook on this local priority, and grateful to have the support of @SenFeinstein and @SenKamalaHarris.
This week, I responded to a 13-year-old in our community who wrote to me, “People deserve the right to work without being afraid the government might shut down.”He’s absolutely right. I told him I’ll continue working to ensure we avoid another senseless shutdown. #DearPete
Honored to be joined for tonight’s #SOTU by Sr. Hortencia Del Villar, Director of Social Concerns of the Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino and immigrant-rights advocate. Few people are more dedicated to equality and justice within our community.
Let's be clear - @realdonaldtrump's failure to fulfill a campaign promise does not constitute a national emergency. It's time for him to let Congress do our job and provide funding for smart, effective solutions at the southern border. #SOTU
On this day 106 years ago, Rosa Parks was born. Her famous act of bravery helped spark a movement that would change America, and the world, forever. #BlackHistoryMonth
Right now, only about 17% of commercial vehicles are scanned at ports of entry. Investments in technology at our ports will stop these types of shipments in the future. @realDonaldTrump's wall will not.
As members of the conference committee, our job is to worry about the facts, not semantics. I look forward to continuing our bipartisan work to find evidence-based, effective solutions to help enhance security at our southern border.

Honored to receive @NatlHeadStart’s 2019 Pledge Award.One of my first jobs was working as a Head Start teacher’s aide, where I learned that we have a responsibility to ensure that every child has an opportunity to succeed. Years later, I took that lesson with me to Congress.
I'm committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find smart solutions that will enhance security at our southern border while upholding the values that make our country great. I look forward to getting started.
Bill dedicated much of his life to our community, and his legacy of service won’t soon be forgotten. It was an honor to know him and to work with him to address regional concerns. My thoughts are with his loved ones during this difficult time.
Moving forward, it is my hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will work together to reach an agreement to enhance border security through evidence-based solutions. I look forward to being a part of those efforts.
I’m glad that the president has finally decided to end his disastrous shutdown, but hundreds of thousands of Americans, including many here in the Inland Empire, suffered needlessly for 35 days because of his refusal to compromise on his demands for a border wall.

If @realDonaldTrump is serious about reforming our broken immigration system, he needs to re-open the government. Once the shutdown is over we can start negotiating. Hopefully he won’t walk away from the table again.
The president has never been a reliable negotiating partner, and this administration has always been more interested in cutting legal immigration and separating families than actual reform.
Thank you to everyone who's reached out to share their shutdown stories so far. If you or someone you know has been hurt by this shutdown, please visit this link to learn about available resources.
From lowering the costs of health care and prescription drugs, to making sure we invest in our crumbling infrastructure, the priorities of the Inland Empire are the priorities of the American people. I look forward to this opportunity to make sure those priorities are addressed.
The House has passed bipartisan bill after bipartisan bill to re-open the government, but @realDonaldTrump refuses to act. It's time to stop playing politics with people's lives and #EndTheShutdown.
Thousands of American families, including many throughout San Bernardino County, are suffering due to the government shutdown. If you or your family have been affected, I'd like to hear your
There are effective ways to make sure our southern border is secure — building @realDonaldTrump's wall is not one of them. Thanks to my friend @RepScottPeters for the much-needed dose of common sense. #EndTheShutdown
Pick a lie.
While House Democrats are passing bipartisan bills to re-open the federal government, @realDonaldTrump won't even stay at the negotiating table. It's time to stop hurting innocent Americans and end the #TrumpShutdown.
Shutdowns have real consequences. Americans are suffering, and the president doesn't seem to care. This week, the House will continue to pass bills to re-open the government. @realDonaldTrump should follow our lead.
Threatening to withhold disaster aid after our state was devastated by wildfires is a disgusting new low, even for this president.
Last week the House passed bipartisan legislation to re-open the government, but California families are still going without paychecks because @realDonaldTrump refuses to come to the table. It's time to do the right thing and end the #TrumpShutdown.
More than 30% of federal employees are veterans, but @realDonaldTrump is willing to withhold their paychecks indefinitely because Congress won’t waste billions of dollars on a border wall. It’s time for him to stop playing politics with people’s lives and end the #TrumpShutdown.
Day 1: Swear in the most diverse Congress ever pass two bipartisan bills to re-open the government .Day 2: Introduce the #ForThePeople Act to clean up corruption in Washington. @HouseDemocrats are delivering results for the American people, and we’re just getting started.
Today I had the honor of being sworn-in for a third term in Congress by @SpeakerPelosi. I look forward to being a voice for the Inland Empire in the 116th Congress, and I'm so grateful for the chance to continue representing the community that raised me.
New year, new office! In the 116th Congress, #CA31 residents can find me in 109 Cannon House Office Building.
Throughout the 115th Congress, I focused on working across the aisle to deliver results for San Bernardino County. I'm grateful for the opportunity to build on that work as we head into the 116th Congress. 
Wishing everyone in #CA31 a Merry Christmas!
Throughout the 115th Congress, I've been committed to improving the lives of Inland Empire families. I've worked hard to deliver results for our region, and I look forward to continuing that work.
As we look ahead to the 116th Congress, I’m proud that @HouseDemocrats are ready to hit the ground running with an agenda that will empower working families in the Inland Empire and throughout the country. Excited to get to work #ForThePeople.

Jack H. Brown lived an inspiring life, and one that focused on service to our community. I'm proud that we'll be able to cement his legacy in the heart of his beloved hometown of San Bernardino.
On December 7, 1941, brave Americans banded together in the face of catastrophic loss to defend our nation and stand up for freedom around the world. We will never forget those who lost their lives that day, and will continue to honor those who answered the call to service.
Looking for an affordable health care plan? There's still time to #GetCovered! Visit to find the plan that works best for you and your family.
We will never forget what happened on December 2, 2015, and my office will continue working to ensure those affected on that day have every resource they need to overcome this tragedy.

It's absurd that @HouseGOP decided to spend today voting to gut the #EndangeredSpeciesAct. America's wildlife should be regarded as one of our greatest national treasures. I voted against this backwards proposal because I believe we should work to #StopExtinction.

The service and sacrifice that our veterans have made for us will never truly be repaid. To all of the veterans across #CA31 and throughout the country- thank you. #VeteransDay
Grateful for the opportunity to participate in a town hall discussion with Giroux Glass San Bernardino employees. The decision to transition to an employee-owned company demonstrates their belief that when employees succeed, the company succeeds.
Don't believe Republicans when they say they support coverage for pre-existing conditions. @NBCNews says the claim that Republicans are the defenders of people with pre-existing conditions "the biggest whopper of them all." Read the fact check here 4/4

If the Trump Administration is successful, insurers can start denying coverage for people with pre-existing conditions or charging them more. What does that mean for people in #CA31? It means Inland Empire families will pay much more.  ️ 2/4
Republicans have been sabotaging the Affordable Care Act for the last 2 years, driving premiums up for working families. After Republicans in Congress tried and failed to repeal the ACA, the Trump Administration sued to end protections for people with pre-existing conditions. 1/4
Great news for Inland students from @SBCCDofficial
Good news that @Starbucks is offering all employees back-up subsidized child and adult care, if their regularly-scheduled care is unavailable. It’s a step in the right direction and helps ensure that employees won't have to worry about caring for a loved one or keeping their job.
Manufacturing is at the heart of the Inland Empire economy. By supporting job training and education programs, we can continue to connect Inland Empire residents with good paying jobs right here in our community. #MFGDay18
#HispanicHeritageMonth isn't just about honoring our past, it's also about recognizing the contributions Latinos are making to their communities each and every day.
I'm proud to announce this funding which will help us create opportunities for families all across San Bernardino County.
Inland Empire families should have the resources they need to achieve the American dream of home-ownership, and our small businesses should have access to the capital they need to grow our economy and create jobs. 
REMINDER- Inland Empire students who want to compete in this year's Congressional App Challenge have until October 15th to submit their entries. Learn more here:
The contributions of Latinos have made our country stronger, safer and more prosperous. I’m proud of my heritage, and grateful to the Library of Congress  for the opportunity to talk about what #HispanicHeritageMonth means to me.

This is an incredibly brave and honest look at what’s at stake in the Kavanaugh nomination. Grateful for the courage of my friend and colleague @RepAnnieKuster to share her story, and grateful for the courage Dr. Ford showed in her testimony today.

17 years ago today, nearly 3,000 of our fellow Americans were taken by a horrific act of terror. Today we renew our pledge to #NeverForget the lives that were lost and the brave first responders who rushed into harm's way to save the lives of others on #September11th.
ICYMI: Last week, I invited Inland Empire middle and high school students to participate in the 2018 Congressional App Challenge. I can't wait to see what our talented #CA31 students come up with.
With hundreds of employees in #CA31, @Fritolay and @PepsiCo are some of the Inland Empire's largest employers. I had a great time touring their Rancho Cucamonga facility last week.
Inland Empire firefighters work long hours in extreme conditions to keep our community safe. Last week I had a chance to sit down with some of these local heroes at the Rancho Cucamonga Fire District to tell them how grateful I am for all they do.
CA is dealing with an especially tough fire season, and we need to make sure our local firefighters have every resource they need. I'm glad that I could help @SBCOUNTYFIRE secure this funding which will help keep our firefighters and our community safe.
As of now, Dreamers are still able to apply for renewal of their DACA status. I encourage all eligible Dreamers to apply here →
A full year has passed since @realDonaldTrump ended DACA, and in that year Congress has failed to take any action to #ProtectDreamers. We could solve this problem with bipartisan solutions if @HouseGOP leadership had the courage to pursue them.
I wanted to switch it up for today's #TacoTuesday so I stopped for some taquitos at El Taquito in Colton. Which Inland Empire favorite should I go to next?
I'm excited to host this competition to give Inland Empire students a platform to showcase their talents. Coding will play a major role in the future of our economy, and the Congressional App Challenge gives our students exposure to this exciting field.
So sad to hear about this horrible act of violence in our community. With federal cooperation and resources we can make our region safer, but @realDonaldTrump’s policy of withholding resources from our local law enforcement is making us less safe.
For today's #TacoTuesday, I stopped by Leno's Rico Taco in Colton with Dan Flores, member of the Board of Education for the Colton Joint Unified School District. Thanks to Leno Moreno for giving us a chance to catch up and talk about what's going on in Colton and around the IE.
Every Inland Empire family should have access to high-quality health care, regardless of their economic situation. I'm proud to announce this funding, which will allow more medical residents to train and treat patients right here in San Bernardino County.
Senator McCain always did what he thought was best for the country. Working with him on a bipartisan compromise to protect Dreamers was one of the greatest privileges of my time in Congress.
John McCain dedicated his entire life to serving our country. My thoughts are with his family tonight as we mourn the loss of an inspiring leader and American hero.
By working to support our local manufacturers, we can ensure there are good-paying jobs in the Inland Empire for years to come. Thanks to @TPGpipe in Rialto for the tour and for talking to me about how we can continue to grow our local economy.

One of my top priorities is connecting Inland Empire residents with good-paying jobs right here in our region. Stop by my 2018 Inland Empire Job Fair in Colton on Tuesday to meet with over 50 local employers who are ready to hire.
Communities like ours rely on small businesses to create jobs, but the burden of student loan debt has made it hard for entrepreneurs to get their businesses off the ground. My new bill seeks to change that.
Earlier this summer I kicked off my #TacoTuesday tour with some shredded beef tacos at Super Burrito in San Bernardino. I'll be hitting up local taco spots to spend more time with business owners and people from our community to hear more about the issues affecting IE families.
While working families in communities like ours haven’t seen a wage increase in years, the president is planning to give yet another tax cut to millionaires. We need economic policies that work for everyone, not just the rich.

In this week's #DearPete, I wrote to Michelle in San Bernardino to tell her that although only our Senators have a vote in the fight to #StopKavanaugh, I’ll always stand up for a woman's right to make her own health care decisions.
Thanks to the Republican tax law, wealthy corporations are paying less in taxes than ever before while working families in communities like ours are being asked to foot the bill for a $1 trillion deficit.
DACA recipients go to our schools, start businesses in our communities, and even serve in our military. They deserve to know that they'll be able to continue the lives they've built here. I'm proud to have passed these amendments to #ProtectDreamers.
I’m proud that the Appropriations Committee passed my bipartisan amendment with @MarkAmodeiNV2 to ensure that no DACA recipient serving in our military can be deported. Dreamers who serve deserve to know they have a future in the country they've risked their lives to defend.
My goal has always been to give Inland Empire families a voice in Congress, and events like this one make that possible. I hope you'll join me for tonight's telephone town hall to discuss the issues affecting our community.
Thanks to everyone who came out to my Senior Fair in Rancho Cucamonga last week! If you still have questions about Medicare, Social Security, or local resources for Inland Empire seniors, please reach out to my office at 909-890-4445.
We know that @realDonaldTrump’s #SCOTUS nominee will pose a direct threat to a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions. I’m proud to #CommitToRoe to defend the access of women across the country to the health care services they need.
This heartbreaking story is another example of the lasting damage @realDonaldTrump’s cruel policies have inflicted on children. Asylum seekers should not be met with more trauma when they arrive in the United States. #ProtectFamilies              
Today the House passed my bill to honor the memory of Jack H. Brown. From founding the Boys Girls Club of San Bernardino to supporting our veterans and first responders through the Stater Bros. Charities, Jack was always there for our community.
Connecting Inland Empire seniors with resources in our community is one of my top priorities. If you or a senior you know has questions about health or nutrition programs, or needs help with a federal agency, please stop by my 2018 Senior Fair!
Any policy that instructs our government to lock up innocent children is a bad policy. Today I urged my colleagues to vote down an amendment that would allow @realDonaldTrump to continue jailing children at the border, but Republicans passed the amendment anyway.

I respect the right of our local officials to make this decision, but I hope that DA Ramos, DA-elect Anderson and the Board of Supervisors can all agree that these actions have disqualified Mr. Selyem from government service.
We cannot allow racism and bigotry to have a place in our society, especially not in our government. The comments made by Deputy District Attorney Michael Selyem are unacceptable, and he should be fired immediately.
From my family to yours, happy #IndependenceDay!

From higher wages to better health care, #Unions give a voice to those demanding change in a rigged system. This decision is a major blow to working families across the country, but we won't let it stop us from standing together for a brighter future.
This is why we introduced the bipartisan #USAAct with @HurdontheHill and @RepLujanGrisham. Americans are ready for Congress to step up and provide solutions to #ProtectDreamers, and we’re going to need to work together to get it done.
This bigoted policy goes against the values that make America great. We can’t allow today’s decision to deter us, and we have to keep fighting discrimination in all its forms. 
Head Start is a critical resource for working families in the Inland Empire. I'm proud to announce this funding which will help to ensure that every child in our community has access to high-quality early education
The opioid epidemic has hit every community across our country, including our own. I’m proud to have helped pass a bipartisan legislative package to combat this
Thanks to @HurdOnTheHill for continuing to support bipartisan solutions to modernize our border, protect Dreamers, and #KeepFamiliesTogether.
Despite support from both parties, @HouseGOP just killed our discharge petition to start an open debate on DACA. This was our best chance to pass a real, bipartisan solution. Why is Republican leadership so afraid to debate bipartisan bills?
Always great to have Inland Empire students in DC, especially when they pretend to laugh at my jokes. Thanks to @LomaLindaAcadem for stopping by the Capitol today!
Happy to lend you a pen, @RepMarkMeadows.
I applaud this bipartisan rejection of the president's attempt to strip billions from programs like the Children's Health Insurance Program. It's shameful that President Trump would try to cut essential services to pay for his tax cuts for billionaires.
The president's family separation policy is a violation of human rights, and I won't stand by while @realDonaldTrump continues to tear families apart. That's why my Democratic colleagues and I introduced the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act to end this policy.
On #Juneteenth2018, we celebrate 153 years since the downfall of slavery in the United States. As we reflect on how far we've come, let us also reflect on how far we still have to go in the fight for equality and justice for all.

Nominating students from our region to attend US Service Academies is always an honor. If you know an Inland Empire student who is interested in applying to a service academy please visit my website.
Congratulations to Adam Gomez of Grand Terrace and David Lopez of Rancho Cucamonga, who will attend the US Naval Academy, and to Aidan Christensen from Rancho Cucamonga who will attend @WestPoint_USMA. I'm proud to have these outstanding students representing our community.
This Father’s Day, thousands of parents are missing their children who were ripped away by the Trump Administration. As the father of two young boys, I can only imagine the pain this policy has caused. @realDonaldTrump, reverse your cruel policy and #KeepFamiliesTogether.
Small businesses are the foundation of the Inland Empire economy, and microloans can play a major role in helping them succeed. I'm glad my office was able to help business owners in our community connect with this critical
Today, six years after the creation of the DACA program, I joined my colleagues to say that despite President Trump’s hateful policies, we’re not giving up our fight to #ProtectDreamers.

Mrs. Aguilar has to do a lot of family stuff each week, but dusting off the glove and warming me up for the #CongressionalBaseballGame wasn’t on her list.
Americans believe in standing up for the vulnerable, not sending them back into harm’s way. The kindness of the American people is not reflected by the cruelty of the Trump
We’re three signatures away from moving forward the bipartisan discharge petition on our #QueenOfTheHill rule. It’s time to get this done and #ProtectDreamers.
Last year, we fought to stop @realDonaldTrump from stripping health care coverage from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. He’s trying again anyway. #ProtectOurCare
Great to see my friend @SteveScalise back on the field! I’m usually not okay with the other team spying on our practices, but I’ll make an exception this time.
Protecting Dreamers shouldn't be a partisan issue. I'm grateful to leaders like @JohnKasich for standing with us as we work toward a bipartisan solution to this problem.
Forever grateful for the service and sacrifice of the brave service members who went into harm’s way in the name of freedom 74 years ago today in Normandy. We will never forget #DDay.
During #ImmigrantHeritageMonth, we’re reminded that the American story is the story of immigrants and their search for better lives in this country. I’m proud of my immigrant heritage, and proud to live in a nation and community where we #CelebrateImmigrants.
.@EPAScottPruitt spent more than $3 million on a 20-member security detail in his first year in office, an amount that is now under investigation. I’m supporting @AppropsDems amendment to ensure the IG can finish this important review. #PollutingPruitt
Had a great time answering questions about Congress from Rancho Cucamonga Middle School students this morning. Thanks for visiting me in DC!
RT @citiesforaction: Our mayors and county executives commend the bipartisan efforts to break the impasse in Congress and bring up immigrat…
This morning AG Sessions proudly described your policy to take children from their parents at the border to deter them from entering the country to lawfully claim asylum. This is your policy and you have the power to fix it. Do the right thing.
This is just not true. @realDonaldTrump, this is your cruel and inhumane policy and you must take action to end it. Where are your family values?
Every American should be entitled to equal protection under the law, regardless of sexual orientation. We must pass the Equality Act to establish clear, nationwide protections for the #LGBTQ community.
Our bipartisan bill would provide Dreamers with a path to citizenship in the only country they’ve ever known as home. Thank you @SenJohnMcCain for your leadership.
Happy #Pride Month! As we celebrate the #LGBTQ community, we must also continue to stand up against @realDonaldTrump’s hateful policies of discrimination.
Our country was built by immigrants and our policies should reflect that. The Trump Administration must put an end to its cruel policy of separating children from their parents at the border. #FamiliesBelongTogether
I wrote the USA Act with @HurdOnTheHill because Dreamers deserve a chance to earn citizenship in the only country they've ever known as home. I’m proud to support this discharge petition, which only needs 5 more signatures to bring our bill to the floor.
Filling shelters with children who were ripped from their parents is not sound immigration policy, it’s outright cruel. We have to be better than this.
Today we honor the service and sacrifice of those who gave their lives for our freedom. Thank you to all who have served.
