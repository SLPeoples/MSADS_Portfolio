.@IlhanMN slanderous attack on President @BarackObama as a “murderer” is a vicious slander beyond any acceptable bounds. How long will Democrats abide these attacks?
Voted NO on politically correct weakened Resolution which failed to specifically condemn recent hateful anti-Semitic statements by Member of Congress. Shameful backdown. Resolution replete w so much moral equivalency to mean nothing. Sad day for Congress. Victory for hate speech!
Very good mtg w advocates from @CF_Foundation, Matt Genova of Garden City John Gill of Bay Shore. Discussed important advances in dealing w Cystic Fibrosis need for continued research. As member of Congressional Cystic Fibrosis Caucus I assured them of my continued support.

Very positive meeting in Washington, DC with Col. Asbery, Army Corps of Engineers New York Region Commander, on the Fire Island Inlet, Gilgo Beach, Jones Inlet Project. It will be concluded this month.
Shameful that Democrats can’t come together to denounce anti-Semitism unequivocally. Do the right thing for your party and your country and stop with false equivalency and stop caving to political correctness. Get it done!

Congress must go on record denouncing @IlhanMN anti-Semitic statements and remove her from House Foreign Affairs Committee. This anti-Semitic hate must not be tolerated in United States Congress.
Excellent discussion on school safety gun regulation at @Newsday moderated by @RepSteveIsrael. Panelists included Nassau PD Commissioner Ryder Suffolk Commissioner Hart. Intelligent discussion questions from audience. Informative, intelligent event. Proud to participate.
Anti-Semitism everywhere must be condemned - especially in the United States Congress!
Jon Stewart was telling it like it is. Trump Justice Dept. is doing a good job running a program that works. Now it’s essential @POTUS administration support legislation that I’m co-sponsoring to help injured ill 911 responders survivors by fully funding extending 911 VCF
In accepting the Council of Jewish Organizations (COJO) Statesmanship Award I denounced BDS and all anti-Semitism whether on college campuses, in Europe, in the United Nations or in the United States Congress!!

Congratulations to all my Dominican American constituents as we celebrate Dominican Independence Day and mark the closing of Dominican Heritage Month.
Now that all the publicity from the 9/11 Victims Compensation Fund news conference is behind us, the hard work of lining up votes begins. And we will get it done. Too many brave people like NYPD Bomb Squad Det. Lou Alvarez have suffered for us not to fully fund the VCF.

New York Democrats are to blame for @Amazon disaster:
Clear lesson from @Amazon disaster: Time for New York Gov’t leaders to speak out and make it clear that radical progressives will not control decisions affecting future of NY. Real leaders don’t surrender to fear or intimidation or stay quiet when strong voices are needed.
Voted to fully fund govt avoid another disastrous shutdown. Hope @POTUS Trump realizes he can’t take advice from Freedom Caucus. They led him into shutdown w no chance of winning like Charge of Light Brigade. last night they abandoned him to vote w anti-Trump progressive left
This is one time I agree with @NYCMayor de Blasio and @NYGovCuomo. Loss of @Amazon is terrible for New York. All because progressives put sanctimony and ideological purity before workers and taxpayers. Sad day for New York.
Absolutely disgraceful that @Amazon is driven from New York by left wing progressive politicians. Terrible loss of jobs for New York workers and New York economy.
Great meeting with Federal Correctional Officers. Their work is extremely dangerous. Assured them I would again cosponsor and vote for Thin Blue Line Act (H.R. 115) to make murdering federal law enforcement officer a capital crime.
Excellent bipartisan meeting with 9/11 victims to support legislation providing necessary funding for Victims Compensation Fund to compensate workers killed or injured on 9/11 or their survivors.

Border deal is far from perfect. But is a step in the right direction. Reality is we have divided government. Time to realize you never get all you want when government is divided. Another shutdown would be bad for the country and a gift to Democrats. Let’s get back to real work.
Good meeting in DC with top @AFGENational Local 3369 officials Edwin Osorio and Jennifer Ramirez regarding issues at local Social Security offices. Very constructive.

Important that GOP not let the Freedom Caucus lead us to the Valley of Death - political and governmental.
Good news that the federal government will reopen. Shouldn’t have happened in the first place. Now time for Democrats to fund border wall and Republicans to move on DACA and TPS. Both sides should ignore fringes - Progressives on the left and Freedom Caucus on the right.
@harryspolitics I was one of only seven Republicans to vote with the Democrats to re-open the government without a wall.
As always, Rosemary I are so proud of Erin. She is a true fighter. Go Erin! Go Irish!
