.@USNavy Midshipman Samuel Quach, a @CHS_Rangers graduate, will be commissioned to serve aboard the USS New Orleans after his graduation from @UTAustin. Samuel, this Navy vet thanks you for your patriotism.
It’s a sad day in the People’s House when Democrats care more about filling their campaign coffers than representing the best interests of the American people. Read my statement about why I voted against #HR1 here:
#HR1 creates a 6:1 govt match for all small donations, meaning that if someone donates $200 to a candidate, the federal govt will give them $1200 of YOUR tax dollars. Even if you don't support them, you’ll end up paying campaign salaries for politicians.
#HR1 jeopardizes the validity of our election systems by requiring states to implement automatic voter registration, online voter registration same-day voter registration WITHOUT any safeguards to protect against fraud.
Texans agree the 10 most terrifying words are “I’m from the federal government I’m here to help.” I spoke on the House Floor this week to ask my colleagues to respect the Constitution, the 10th Amendment states’ rights vote against #HR1, or the "For the Big Government Act.”
Honored to meet w/ Ambassador @HarshShringla @GOPLeader today. I’m honored to represent a large and vibrant Indo-American community in #TX22 will continue every effort to strengthen our US-India bond! @IndianEmbassyUS
#HR1 restricts YOUR First Amendment right to free speech. Even the @ACLU agrees!
.@GOPLeader is right, #HR1 isn’t “for the people,” but rather “for the politicians” and is just another instance where Democrats want to “pass the bill so that you can find out what’s in it.” It’s bad for all Americans. Watch here ↓
Wow! @Fulshear_HS sophomore Madison Outhier won the world champion breakaway roping event at @RFDTVAmerican last weekend! Way to go Madison!

From Politico: Recent polling has found the public views the concept of a single-payer system favorably. But that support significantly erodes when voters learn it would eliminate most private health insurance and could raise taxes. No to #MedicareForAll.

Maybe there’s a reason Democrats keep telling folks to not worry about the cost of the #GreenNewDeal. According to @AAF, their plan could cost taxpayers up to $93 trillion over 10 years – that means you’d be paying between $36,100 $65,300 per year.
Great story about the Zamora-Gonzalez family! The first family to have three generations attend @StaffordMSD!
Texas #1 in US for oil, nat gas wind. Adding huge new solar. As America adapts to global industrial activities affecting Earth, any change MUST be viable in market. #TX22 leading - new solar for 40,000 TX homes! #NoGreenNewDeal - not viable in market. @HouseGOP @HouseCommerce

Last year, @EIAgov estimated that the US would produce 11.95 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2042. We are now on track to exceed that THIS YEAR! We are 23 YEARS ahead of schedule! #LiquidFreedom #Energy4Jobs
Always great to meet with my #TX22 bosses when they are in DC! This morning, James Grant from Katy @DucksUnlimited stopped by to discuss my support for the Farm Bill the need to preserve Texas wetlands for our future generations.

Great to see my friend @UHpres in the Capitol today to talk about the important role @UHouston plays in our community and ways we can continue to keep Texas at the front of innovation. #GoCoogs
It's beyond ridiculous that @NRDems are trying to remove “so help you God” from their witness oath. This enhances the long-time liberal goal of removing God from the public square again demonstrates how little the Democrats regard people of faith.
Great meeting w/ @TX_TA and one of my #TX22 bosses, Bernie Warriner Jr., to talk about the importance of #NAFTA, workforce development and the need to update and improve our infrastructure. Thanks for stopping by!
Republicans offered a measure to protect folks w/ pre-existing conditions. Every GOP member voted for it EVERY Democrat opposed it. Partisan politics should never get in the way of protecting those who need care the most.
RT @FirefightersHOU:
Keeping the 5 brave @houstonpolice officers who were shot this evening in our prayers.

After 35 days of a partial shutdown, the govt will fully reopen to allow over 800,000 federal employees to get back to work or receive pay for work they have been doing. Congress POTUS MUST come together find a permanent solution to secure our southern border.
Exciting news for #Texas energy production — the US is on track to produce more oil than Saudi Arabia and Russia COMBINED by 2025! #LiquidFreedom #Energy4Jobs
Last week, 9/11 survivor and #TX22’s own Jason Spindler was one of 21 killed in a terror attack in Kenya. Today, he was laid to rest at home in Houston. Our prayers are with his family. We must stand together to fight terrorism around the world.
It’s unacceptable that @SpeakerPelosi has blocked @POTUS from giving his #SOTU at the U.S. Capitol. Shutting down opposing views for a political agenda is beneath the decorum of the People’s House.
Great to start my day w/ #TX22 high school students who are in DC learning about Congress w/ @CloseUp_DC! We discussed how my career path led me to Congress the importance of listening working across the aisle to get legislation passed. Thanks for stopping by YOUR Capitol!
Americans continue to stand for life deserve accountability on how their tax dollars are spent. I proudly reintroduced the Taxpayer Conscience Protection Act, to shine a light on how Medicaid funds are spent on groups that promote or perform abortion services.
A great #TX22 boss #WWII veteran, Al Towns, was born on January 30, 1918. Last night I wished him a happy 101st birthday on the House floor. He says the key to living to 101 years old is “don’t think too far ahead.” Watch join me in wishing Al a very happy birthday! ↓
Today on the 46th anniversary of #RoevWade, we remember the innocent lives lost to abortion and stand together in defense of life.

Wow! Texas has had the lowest unemployment rate ever of 3.7% for the 30th month in a row! Great to see Texans and our economy thriving!
