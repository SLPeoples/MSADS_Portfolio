If President Trump wants to get serious about border security, he should be talking about giving the Coast Guard the 21st century resources they need to secure our nation’s vast maritime border -- not stiffing them on their paychecks.
It’s official—the #trumpshutdown is now the longest government shutdown in American history. This shutdown is wreaking havoc on our aviation security. It’s time to end this temper tantrum and start paying air traffic controllers, TSA officers, and other federal workers again!

I’m hearing from Oregonians who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay. People are afraid of losing their homes or not being able to pay their bills, and all b/c Trump is using federal workers as leverage for his ineffective and expensive border wall. #TrumpShutdown
The majority of suspected terrorists enter the U.S. through airports, not the southern border. The best way to root them out is a well-funded, well-trained @TSA and @CBP – too bad @RealDonaldTrump is forcing them to work without pay for the duration of the #TrumpShutdown.
The majority of drugs smuggled into the U.S. come through legal ports of entry. Instead of spending $5B on a wall that will do little-to-nothing to stop drug flow into the US, we could spend that money on much-needed resources to support our border agents. #TrumpShutdown
While Trump his Mar-a-Lago cronies might like walls around their mansions, a border wall will be an expensive, wasteful, ineffective use of taxpayer funds. Let’s fund real, effective border security initiatives to keep criminals drugs out of the U.S. #OpenTheGovernment

Democrats are trying to end the #TrumpShutdown, but Republicans refuse to even debate a reasonable package, forcing hundreds of thousands of Americans to work without pay. All thanks to a presidential temper tantrum.
Don’t take my word for it. Incoming COS Mulvaney said a fence or wall doesn’t stop anybody who wants to get across. End the #TrumpShutdown and fund the government. Show some leadership.
This high school student has a better understanding than President Trump and congressional Republicans of the urgency of climate change. I’m looking forward to taking steps to address this crisis in the Democrat-led congress.

Despite what President Trump tweets, his own administration’s report shows climate change is an existential threat to the entire planet and is impacting our health, our agriculture, and even our economy. We must take decisive action before it’s too late.

The #KavanaughConfirmation hearings are an absolute farce. If Kavanaugh joins the Supreme Court, he will erode protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions, women, workers, and the environment. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote NO on Kavanaugh:
A Republican lawsuit to dismantle the ACA's protections for pre-existing conditions--backed by President Trump--begins today in Texas. This shameful lawsuit would gut protections for 312k individuals with pre-existing conditions in my district:
NAFTA has devastated American manufacturing and sent millions of jobs overseas. While I will wait until I have the opportunity to review the new deal to make judgement, I will only support an agreement that supports American workers.
We are facing a student loan crisis in the U.S., and young people are crippled by their loan debt for decades after graduating from college. Now, the Trump administration is making it even harder for young people to afford a higher education:
While I had many disagreements with John McCain over the years, he was for decades unquestionably a dedicated public servant, both in the Navy and in the Senate. President Trump's decision against flying the flag at half-staff is petty and un-American.
I’ll be hosting Town Hall meetings on the coast this week - I hope you’ll be able to join me!

To those who have received my newsletter: congressional rules dictate I soften my language and say 'I believe' before all my opinions even if they are factually substantiated. This is not the newsletter that I wanted to send out, but congressional bureaucracy got in the way.
Absolutely disgusting. Trump's Mar-a-Lago buddies have hijacked the VA and are profiting off our nation's vets. This isn't worthy of our nation's heroes and Congress must take a stand for them and investigate this disgrace.
I'll be holding two Town Hall meetings this Thursday, August 9 -- one focused on issues affecting senior citizens in Springfield at 3:30 PM, and one in Eugene at 5:30 PM. I hope to see you there!

Just a week after 12 Russians were indicted for election interference and 72 hrs after Trump refused to hold Putin accountable, Republicans voted to zero-out funding to protect our election system. We are under attack the GOP is standing with Trump Putin rather than the US.
U.S. intelligence has proven that Russia has interfered in the 2016 election, and they're planning to do it again. Our democracy has been attacked, but President Trump not only refuses to stand up to Putin, he's standing *with* him - against the U.S.
President Trump today stood next to Vladimir Putin—who has repeatedly, sometimes violently, undermined democratic ideals—and refused to stand up for America and condemn Russia's interference in our elections. It was an embarrassment for the U.S. and a damning moment for Trump.
The Trump administration continues to roll back health care protections for consumers one shameful step at a time—this weekend, they stopped payments that help insurance companies offer coverage to people with pre-existing conditions.
#SCOTUS nominee, Kavanaugh, is an activist  who will roll back decades of progress for working Americans, women, minorities and the LGBTQ community. I stand with my colleagues in the Senate in opposing this nomination.
