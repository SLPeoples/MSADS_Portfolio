After numerous disruptions, we made it to Central. I am so grateful to Dianna for taking the time to show me just how inequitable our transit systems are the types of critical improvements needed to ensure accessible transit for people of all abilities.
When we finally got to Central Square, the only available elevator was broken, so we had to take the train to Harvard then board a bus back to Central. This detour added 40 minutes onto our total trip time.
At Park Street, where we switched from Green to Red, Dianna showed me that the elevator buttons are often too high for her / too hard to push.
At Lechmere Station in #Cambridge, the train went past the accessibility ramp, forcing us to wait for the next train to arrive, adding 10 mins to our trip.
#FBF Last Friday, my friend Dianna took me on her public transit commute so I could experience firsthand the variety of obstacles inequities that our neighbors w/ disabilities have to face on a daily basis.
