@scottwongDC
I fully support @POTUS’ efforts to secure the border - including using an emergency declaration - following the clear intentions of the Democrats to simply kick the can down the road and play politics with the safety of Americans.
While there are concerns about money being taken away from much needed barrack renovations at @forthood, Acting Defense Sec Shanahan’s recent comments that military housing will not be touched is an important step I’ll continue to push the issue to make sure this is the case.
As I have said many times, the need for an emergency declaration is the result of Congress failing to pass legislation that adequately secures our border.
Good conversation with the folks in Hico today! Looking forward to getting back to Washington and working hard for you.

The threats to our nation are real, and I will continue to oppose legislation that does not provide for more border agents, technology, and where necessary a physical barrier along our southern border.
It is time for Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer to finally negotiate in good faith, and stop holding federal workers hostage with their partisan agenda.
Democrats offered the American people a better way, but their first month in office has demonstrated nothing more than an unwillingness to work across the aisle.
Continuing resolutions are simply a stopgap - kicking the can on critical issues like the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border.
Predictably, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer allowed their hatred for President Trump to supersede their responsibility to protect our sovereignty.
