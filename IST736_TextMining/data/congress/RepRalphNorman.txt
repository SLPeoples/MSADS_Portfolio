This vote WOULD HAVE PROVIDED PAY to federal workers that have not received their paychecks this year.This vote failed 200 to 215, by the way. At the very least, we should not hold federal employees hostage during negotiations.
This vote is the 2nd of its kind in the past week and the second of its kind that the majority of Democrats have rejected on the House floor.Let me clarify, this vote was not to ensure back pay for federal employees – which I previously supported, and has been signed into law.
While #Congress and the @WhiteHouse remain at an impasse on border funding and reopening the government, today Republicans put forward a vote to ensure ALL federal employees receive pay during the shutdown.

We need a common sense approach to our immigration policies and #border security.I fully support President @realDonaldTrump in his fight for a safe and lawful system of immigration.
Make a commitment to be bold and courageous following his principles to promote his dream of equality, a reality not for some but for all.“The time is always right to do what is right” ~ Martin Luther King Jr.#MLKDAY
Today we remember the life of Martin Luther King Jr., a leader of conviction, truth, and wisdom that inspired Americans to love and respect one another. Let us continue to water the seed he planted for change in all of us for a transformed tomorrow. #MLKDAY
@POTUS is proposing a solution that should bring ALL sides to the conversation. By not playing political games, President Trump is working to make a deal that will provide resources that are desperately needed and reopen the government.
As you can see, our President is willing to come to the negotiating table with an offer that has received bi-partisan support.
4. It also allocates $800 million for drug detection technology to secure ports of entry, 2,750 new border agents and law enforcement professionals, and 75 new immigration judges to reduce an immense backlog of asylum requests.
His offer includes: 1. A three year extension of protections for DACA recipients 2. $5.7 billion for a barrier at our southern #border 3. Protections for 300,000 TPS recipients
President @realDonaldTrump has offered a comprehensive solution to address both border security and the partial government #shutdown.
I applaud @POTUS for coming up with yet another solution to secure our #border and reopen the government. His repeated efforts to negotiate show his true commitment to protecting all Americans.
Each year hundreds of thousands of Americans march our nation’s Capital sending a bold message to all that life is precious and abortion is wrong! God Bless all the Americans who marched today for the dignity and preservation of human life. Keep up the good fight!
As we #MarchforLife, we celebrate the sanctity of each human life.With 4 children and 16 grandchildren, I know how unique special each child is.I will continue to the fight to protect life in this Congress, just as I have before, and be a voice for those who do not have one.
