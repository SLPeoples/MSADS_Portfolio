To be one of the first Muslim women in Congress on this #InternationalWomensDay is so special. I’m celebrating the women who paved the way and committing to fight for a #BalanceforBetter. That includes #equalpay and access to #healthcare for women everywhere.
Proud to join my Democratic colleagues on the steps of our nation’s capitol in celebration of our vote today to ensure access to the ballot box, end the reign of big money in politics, and demand accountability and ethics from public officials #ForThePeople. #HR1

Consuela Lopez is an amazing advocate for so many communities in the 13th Congressional district. Fighting for economic justice, immigrant rights, environmental justice, you name it. I’m so glad she’s joining me at the #SOTU. #13thDistrictStrong
May we also remember that her action to not get up from that seat on the bus was considered radical and unpopular by many. Those of us who demand justice know that it was a needed action. May we continue on the path for justice no matter how unpopular it may be.
#RosaParks holds a special place in the hearts of the residents in Detroit and the 13th. What an honor was it for her to call Detroit home. She also worked in the congressional office for the Honorable John Conyers. An amazing woman in the work toward freedom.
Rosa Parks was born on this day in 1913. We remember her for her courageous action on that Montgomery Bus in December of 1955, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and for all of her work in the Civil Rights Movement and beyond. #RosaParks is a true embodiment of the fight for justice.
I ask us all to celebrate this month with action to fight against the continued bigotry by helping to dismantle the racialized policies and structures that keep us from truly being free.
Today marks the beginning of Black History Month. The 13th Congressional District has led historic fights for freedom, justice equality. We still have more work to do. We have yet to create the America that truly protects, honors and respects our Black neighbors.
.@RepEliotEngel, feel free to call me if you have anything further to discuss.
.@RepEliotEngel, how are we ever going to obtain peace if we don't listen to those directly impacted by this issue? With your words, I hope you’ll consider joining us to do just that - listen and learn. My sity (grandmother) will welcome you with an embrace love.
Greedy pharmaceutical companies are not helping our healthcare system. No one should be harmed or lose their life because they cannot afford life-saving drugs.
Today was my first hearing on @OversightDems. We heard heartbreaking testimony from Mrs. Worsham, who lost one of her two insulin-dependent daughters because of high prescription drug costs. This is immoral and should not have happened to this family.

President Trump's #MuslimBan further vilified a group of people. We continue to see harmful rhetoric from this Administration against Muslims and other marginalized groups. It must stop and we must continue to fight for a country where everyone is welcome. No matter who you are.

The #TrumpShutdown shouldn’t have happened in the first place. This was unnecessary and I’m glad that the harm that so many Americans faced is ending. We have a job in the coming days to not allow this President to push a fake crisis and we cannot buy into his dangerous rhetoric.
It’s extremely important to me to stay connected to residents in the 13th Congressional District, even when I’m in D.C. I will be calling constituents every week to hear from them. #13thDistrictStrong
We must #EndTheShutdown now. I cannot stress enough how this is causing a crisis for some of our most vulnerable residents, in addition to the federal workers who are furloughed and working without pay.
Yesterday, I called a constituent that is concerned about the ongoing, unnecessary #TrumpShutdown. He's a resident of Wayne, MI, who became disabled because of a car accident during his childhood. He is fearful about what will happen to his HUD assistance for housing.

Hands off our bodies. #FightForRoe
It is also time to repeal the Hyde Amendment which disproportionally impacts low-income folks and people of color, preventing these communities from getting the access to abortion care that we all have a right to. #Roe46
Today is the anniversary for Roe v. Wade, which made abortions legal. Since then, we have seen countless attacks on reproductive rights body autonomy for those who can become pregnant. We must continue to #FightForRoe ensure everyone has access to the healthcare they need.
I stand with the trans community, and the LGBTQ community as as whole, in ending discriminatory policies and practices. It is our duty to work toward acceptance, no matter who you are.
The #TransMilitaryBan is another example of how this administration continues to discriminate against marginalized communities and push forth a culture of bigotry. It is sad to see the SCOTUS allow this ban to go into effect.
Let’s commit ourselves to service, justice, and a swift timetable toward freedom and justice. #MLK90 #MLK
We must center the oppressed in our fight for justice and not set our own timetable for another person’s freedom. That timetable for freedom and justice is now and we must set out on the path towards it. #MLK90 #MLK
Dr. King urged allies to not wait to act, to not choose so called 'order' when there is an urgent need for justice. We must not shun direct actions just because we are uncomfortable with the methods. #MLK90 #MLK
As I enter my second month in office, I am reminded of the sense of urgency to see our lives change for the better. Dr. King wrote a letter from the Birmingham Jail after he was arrested for leading a march, that resonates with what is happening in our nation today. #MLK90 #MLK
All across the 13th Congressional District, our strong and diverse communities celebrated the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. #MLK #MLK90
My statement on President Trump's speech today: #EndTheShutdown
Had an amazing time at #WomensMarchDetroit today at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History. The energy I felt was remarkable. We must continue to speak up, be loud, be courageous, and demand change.
On this 28th day of the unnecessary #TrumpShutdown, I joined federal workers at a rally in Detroit. Their message? They want the @senatemajldr to #CallTheVote and #EndTheShutdown.
Make no question, the #TrumpShutdown must end now. House Democrats continue to take action to re-open the government and ensure federal workers and those who depend on the services they provide are protected. Mitch McConnell needs to stop hiding and re-open the government now.
@HouseDemocrats This comes after we passed legislation last week that guarantees federal workers back pay.
@HouseDemocrats The Financial Relief for Federal Employees Act directs the Federal Government to issue loans to federal workers with zero interest and zero fees if a shutdown exceeds 15 consecutive days.
Enough is enough. Federal workers have encountered too much harm because of this reckless #TrumpShutdown. That is why I joined @HouseDemocrats in introducing the Financial Relief for Federal Employees Act - it’s time to provide relief to our workers.

The #RaiseTheWage Act would give more than 40 million people a raise and is a crucial tool in lifting folks out of poverty.
The #RaiseTheWage act increases the federal minimum wage to $15/hr by 2024. It’ll also get rid of the sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, youth, and folks with disabilities.
Proud to be a co-sponsor on the #RaiseTheWage Act. House and Senate Democrats introduced this much needed bill today. The current $7.25 federal minimum wage is not enough for someone to put food on the table and keep a roof over their head.

The reality is that federal workers have bills that need to be paid. The reality is that millions of Americans cannot afford for the #TrumpShutdown to go another day. Trump and McConnell need to realize this. End the shutdown now.
Day 24 of the #TrumpShutdown. Day 24 of 800k federal workers not being paid for their work. Day 24 of workers being forced to stay home and not get a paycheck. Day 24 of government services for vulnerable populations being in jeopardy. All over a made up crisis. #EndTheShutdown
I recently signed on to a letter opposing this rule change. Glad to see that the federal courts agree. We cannot allow employers to take away access to healthcare and erode reproductive rights.
These are the human faces of the shutdown. They are in jeopardy of not being able to pay mortgages, college tuition for their children, car notes, even gas to get to work. This is not right. The U.S. Senate must take action to #EndTheShutdown.
Today is day 22 of the #TrumpShutdown, making it the longest shutdown in history. Yesterday, I joined some of my fellow colleagues from the MI House delegation to hear from local federal workers impacted by the shutdown. This shutdown is harming them.

Make no question, on day 1, the House Democratic Majority voted to re-open the government. This week we took further action to #EndTheShutdown, by passing individual appropriations bills. It’s time for Mitch McConnell’s Senate to do its job.

Day 20 of the #TrumpShutdown = Democratic House continuing to take action to re-open the government. Trump? He continues to allow the safety, health, and well-being of Americans to be harmed. Oh, and Mitch McConnell’s Senate? *crickets* #EndtheShutdown!
Here’s the text of my floor speech:
HUD housing unit contracts for more than 450 families in Wayne County have expired because of the #TrumpShutdown, with 150 more set to expire this month. Our most vulnerable residents are being harmed. I went to the House floor to talk more about it today:
I’m about to make my first floor speech in the House regarding the impact of the #TrumpShutdown on our most vulnerable residents. Watch here:
This is why we voted in the House on the first day of session of this Congress to #EndTheShutdown. We won’t stop working to end it, but the President and Mitch McConnell need to show leadership and do the same.
It’s day 19 of the #TrumpShutdown. The President needs to realize that enough is enough. As each day goes by, more and more Americans are harmed by not having a government that is open and fully functional. Again, that’s the true crisis. #EndTheShutdown

Today, we signed on to a letter urging the President to end the shutdown immediately. Working and low-income families cannot afford to have their refunds delayed. #EndTheShutdown!
The Trump administration may say that income tax refunds will come on time, but with the new tax laws and the IRS only operating with 12% of its workforce, it's hard to imagine this to be true. #TrumpShutdown
And we heard from Jessie, with LA VIDA @CHASSCenter. They provide essential services to women who’ve faced domestic abuse and sexual violence. They depend on #VAWA for funding. The #TrumpShutdown has led #VAWA to be expired and now LA VIDA hangs in limbo.
Trump owns this and he needs to #EndTheShutdown.
As this #TrumpShutdown continues, we are still waiting on the United States Senate to take action and for the President to signal a willingness to end this harm for federal workers and those who depend on government programs.
Then we heard from Jack, who is a local attorney. He represents a client that has had their discrimination claim case delayed twice because of a threat of a shutdown and now this #TrumpShutdown. He talked about how EEOC, veteran claims, and social security cases will be delayed.
We heard from Hodari, who is a federal worker and disabled veteran. He is wondering when’s the next time he will be paid because he has a mortgage and helps his parents cover their prescription drug costs. #EndTheShutdown
Numbers are one thing, but it is important for all of us to hear what this means for the day-to-day lives of those in the 13th Congressional District and across this country. #TrumpShutdown

Residents in the 13th deserve clean air, universal healthcare, quality public education, the opportunity to strive. #PAYGO is a barrier to achieving those things to ensure every resident lives in a just equitable society. That’s why I support repealing it. #13thDistrictStrong

Proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill. It’s time to stop disenfranchising voters and ensure that everyone has a true voice in our government.
Yesterday was truly a day to remember to start the 116th Congress. Thank you to all who came to witness and celebrate, and to those who sent well wishes from the 13th Congressional District and beyond.
Yesterday was historic day. Honored to have the privilege to represent the 13th Congressional District and I look forward to fighting for residents. We will forever be #13thDistrictStrong.
