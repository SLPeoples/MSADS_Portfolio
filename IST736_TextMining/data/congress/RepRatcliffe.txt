Congressman Hall leaves behind a timeless legacy that will forever be remembered and appreciated by generations of Texans. Michele and I are keeping Ralph’s family and loved ones in our prayers during this difficult time.
Today the 4th District of Texas lost a great leader, statesman and friend. From his defense of our nation during WWII through his time as our Representative in Congress, Ralph Hall lived a remarkable life dedicated selflessly to serving his fellow citizens.

Now, he will be forced to sign woefully inadequate legislation to avoid another government shutdown, then take further action to ensure our national security needs are met. When the safety of American citizens is on the line, we just can’t afford to miss the mark.
President Trump’s requests very clearly laid out the funding and resources we need to address the growing crisis at our Southern Border – but the bill being sent to his desk falls short.
I voted against H.J. Res. 31 because I could not in good conscience support legislation that fails to fulfill Congress’ constitutional obligation to provide for the common defense by ensuring the security of our territorial borders.
Praying for all who were impacted by the deadly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir today, as we stand in solidarity with India against such violent acts of terrorism across the globe.
The Democrats’ H.R. 8 fails to keep guns out of the hands of criminals based on the false premise that most criminals follow the law and will go through a background check to get a gun. Let's not forget the definition of a criminal: someone who doesn’t obey the law.
Grateful to @JohnCornyn and @SenTedCruz for leading the charge on the Senate passage of our bill to restore the local control of 2,025 acres of land in Northeast Texas. I urge my House colleagues to support this effort to reduce the Federal estate.

I strongly support the president’s call to choose American greatness over partisan political games, as we look to build upon the progress we’ve made so far and unlock the promise of America’s future. #SOTU
In just two years, the Trump administration has delivered huge wins for our country that have left folks with more money in their pockets and less government intrusion in their lives.
President Trump’s address demonstrated why the people of Texas’ 4th District chose a leader for our country that prioritizes the American people over big government and freedom over burdensome regulations.

I’m committed to working on the American people’s behalf to ensure the rule of law is upheld and that justice is properly served across our entire government – especially when it comes to the most sensitive matters of our national security.
My appointment to HPSCI will allow me to bring my background as a former U.S. Attorney and federal terrorism prosecutor to oversight that encompasses the broader intelligence community of our U.S. government and military.
There's no better stewards of Texas land than the Texans who know it best. That's why I'm working with @JohnCornyn on legislation that will restore the local control of 2,025 acres in Northeast Texas.
In our first hearing this Congress, Democrats want us to consider a bill that blatantly dismantles states' constitutional rights. It comes as no surprise that they're pushing for Washington-knows-best policies right out of the gate.

I’m deeply saddened by the devastating news out of Pittsburg. Such violence against the Jewish community is sickening and reprehensible. Grateful for the swift work of law enforcement to bring the suspect into custody, as we hold the victims and their families in our prayers.
I commend @realDonaldTrump's signature of S. 1595 to impose tough new sanctions on those who provide weapons to Hezbollah, target Hezbollah’s fundraising and recruiting efforts, and provide additional tools to respond to Hezbollah’s global criminal network.
This makes it very hard to understand why the FBI used him as the basis to launch the highest profile investigation in recent times into the potential collusion by a presidential campaign with the Russian government.
My questioning with Papadopoulos confirmed that he was a 28-year-old policy adviser who'd been on the job a month at the time the Trump-Russia investigation was launched, and to this day he's never been to Russia nor met anyone associated with the Russian government.
Looking forward to joining @DanaPerino at 2:10 p.m. ET on @FoxNews to discuss my questioning with George Papadopolous.

What this could reveal is that the Obama DOJ and FBI, in October of 2016, only presented the FISA court with selective evidence in support of their case to get a warrant to spy on a Trump campaign associate, rather than presenting evidence on both sides of the coin.

Operational roles played by Bruce Ohr and Nellie Ohr, and their financial gain from it, were known to at least 1/2 dozen senior FBI and DOJ officials prior to the first FISA application, but were never disclosed.
