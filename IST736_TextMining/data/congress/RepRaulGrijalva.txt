Hard-working federal employees work day and night to keep our government running, and it's a sad reality that the Trump Administration doesn't value them. It's time to #EndTheShutdown and get them back to work.
RT @NRDems: Despite the #TrumpShutdown, @Interior is pushing ahead with permits to drill for oil and gas on public lands. This administrati…

If Secretary Ross and more Trump officials realized federal workers didn't have millions of dollars to fall back on, maybe they wouldn't be holding the paychecks of federal workers hostage for a ridiculous border wall. Absolutely shameful.  
Trump's petulant behavior will not be rewarded with a prime time address to Congress. Pelosi: 1 Trump: 0
It will take decades to clean up the mess left in the Interior Dept by Sec. Zinke, but House Democrats are ready to get started. This Congress, we'll be working #ForThePeople to give Americans and Interior Dept they can be proud of. 
My office is thrilled to join the StandDown resource fair in Phoenix today and tomorrow to share resources for navigating the VA and helping vets receive the benefits they’re entitled to. Thanks to @RepOHalleran and @RepRubenGallego for joining!
Trump congressional Republicans have no credibility when it comes to immigration. For eight years, congressional Republicans did nothing to fix our immigration system, but now they're willing to shutdown the govt for Trump's useless wall. This is wrong.
Wouldn't it be great if Trump put the paychecks of federal employees over the interests of his oil gas pals? It's time to prioritize our workers and #EndTheShutdown
Trump works for the oil gas industry—not the American people. During the #TrumpShutdown he's continued issuing oil gas permits/leases instead of working to #EndTheShutdown. We're calling out Trump's favoritism hearing from who's being hurt today.
So much for a good faith compromise from Trump and congressional Republicans. Trump gets his border wall and limits to asylum, and Dreamers only receive 'temporary' protections. Doesn't seem like a compromise to me.
