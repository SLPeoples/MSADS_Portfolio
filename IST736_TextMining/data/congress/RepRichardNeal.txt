To suggest that these and other atrocities were not crimes is deeply disturbing to those who have worked hard to bring peace and reconciliation to Ireland.

The Republicans’ tax 2.0 legislation is another reckless tax cut for the wealthy that leaves behind average, hardworking families.  I'll be in strong opposition. Watch here:
As health care costs soar Republicans continue their despicable attacks on people with pre-existing conditions, the GOP wants to give yet another unpaid-for tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. And where are working people? Stuck paying for it all.
The first #GOPTaxScam caused millions of Americans to lose their health insurance and contributed to rising health care costs across the country. Do Republicans try to reverse those effects with their “Tax 2.0” proposal? No. They. Don’t.

A compassionate immigration system reflects our country’s basic values. While the Trump Administration is determined to rip families apart, we must remain steadfast and help reunite families with their loved ones and ensure their children are safe.
This situation speaks to a larger issue: the need for a natl discussion around fixing our broken immigration system pave the way for long overdue comprehensive immigration reform. That should include a vigorous re-examination of the role that ICE plays enforcing our laws.
I continue to be outraged at the heartbreaking scenes of scared, uncared for children and devastated families at our nation’s southwest border. The Trump administration’s family separation policy is cruel, inhumane and should end immediately.
