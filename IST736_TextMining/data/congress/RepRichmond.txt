These findings are a clear indication that the @usedgov needs to put guidance in place that will ensure our young black kids are being fairly treated in school. I have worked on this issue tirelessly since coming to Congress I will continue to advocate for black students.
And young black boys are not the only ones suffering from the disproportionate disciplinary action in schools. Young black girls are suspended and expelled at the highest percentages among both sexes and all racial groups.
A @PennGSE study explored the disproportionate impact of school suspension and expulsion on black students in Southern students. Study:
Shortly after introducing this bill, the Obama administration put into place guidelines for school discipline. The current Administration has repealed that guidance.
In 2015, I took to the House floor to debate my Youth Empowerment Strategy which would give students the opportunities they need to be successful. 
It's absolutely unacceptable that schools are punishing our African-American kids the way they do. These kids are dealing with a multitude of issues at home and school should be a safe haven for them.
