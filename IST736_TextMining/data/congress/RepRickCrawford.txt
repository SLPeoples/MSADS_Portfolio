It’s unfortunate that it’s come to this. But if Democrats in Congress are unwilling to help provide the necessary tools for the President to secure our borders and keep our nation safe, then he’s left with very few options.
Yay capitalism!

It’s time to negotiate in good faith, @SpeakerPelosi.  You should get back to the table to solve the humanitarian AND national security crisis at our southern border. The President’s border policy is what is right for all Americans. (4/4)
No one wants anyone coming to our country to die or illegal immigrants committing crimes. A wall/barrier won’t solve all these problems and others but the President’s request will significantly change the humanitarian crisis AND improve the security at our southern border. (3/4)
Putting up a wall or steel barriers in places that funnel immigrants to legal points of entry where enhanced security/detection equipment in his request will be located will significantly improve the current crisis (2/4)

Weyerhaeuser v. USFWS is a victory for the economy and conservation. Regulators will now focus on protecting endangered species where they can actually survive, and not needlessly disrupting rural development. #ESA @westerncaucus @NatResources
Non-scientific ESA regulations impede economic growth across the country, including Arkansas. In 2014, I introduced the Common Sense in Species Protection Act. @NatResources Chairman Emeritus @DocHastings held a field hearing in Batesville over regulatory abuse in Arkansas.
The letter of the law states that for an area to be “critical habitat,” it must first be a “habitat.” SCOTUS’s ruling affirms that @USFWS was abusing its regulatory power and its rulemaking was not grounded in statutory law. #ESA
There is no reason for @USFWS to hamper the economy by placing restrictions on areas where endangered species do not and cannot live without substantial alterations. #ESA
Glad to see SCOTUS rule that for an area to be designated as “critical habitat” for an endangered species, that area must actually be capable of sustaining that species. @westerncaucus

The perpetrators should be charged and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for what they have done – and we can all be thankful that our Bomb Squad/EOD experts are right there, helping out in our communities across the country. (End)
These men and women are absolute experts and are who we want at these scenes/in these situations when called for. They are going to be able to assist any/all law enforcement agencies with granular data to catch the person(s) who have done this
It is my hope that when things like this happen, we will remember those who get these calls, that they are heading full steam ahead to the threat, hoping to render it inert, diffuse it, or, if called for, detonate without any possible collateral damage.
May be dealing with.  They can also put on significant protective gear to guard themselves against a blast that would otherwise harm or potentially cause fatal injuries (see my previous tweets for pictures of these two examples)
Depending on the description of the device and even if there isn’t much of a description, they can now deploy robotic equipment that can go inside to a scene/location and provide live video of what they...
These experts who get these calls have a multitude of tools and resources now to assess the scene/device, more so than when I would join local law enforcement many years ago. We would have to get "eyes" on it directly to proceed
We had to do all we could to ensure the least amount of harm possible to civilians and our unit as we assessed the device and what needed to be done. Initial Success, or Total Failure
When I got called for different circumstances/situations, we had to determine what kind of device we were dealing with, its potential for harm, and how to secure the area around the device/munition
There is no consideration for any other factor when they get the call about a device other than to determine what they are dealing with and what the immediate next steps should be to prevent harm/injuries
The slogan we operated by in my unit was “Initial Success or Total Failure” and that is exactly what these individuals think of when they get the call of an IED/or explosive device
Quite literally – they are trained to handle a bomb of ANY kind and what to do with that device in the circumstances that they find it in and determine what to do accordingly
All of these men and women who are a part of the bomb squads/bomb disposal units who get these calls are some of the best trained and are experts in how to handle a bomb of any kind, in any situation
