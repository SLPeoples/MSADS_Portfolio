Congress has a Constitutional obligation to serve as a check on the president. I support a resolution to terminate the president’s national emergency declaration and to reverse the president’s unconstitutional action will continue to challenge the president’s abuse of authority
The president is talking about removing funds that support military housing for the women and men in uniform as well as improvements to roads and hospitals on military bases and putting those funds towards building a wall in places that are unnecessary and impractical.
President Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border but failed to acknowledge the funds for a wall would come at a high cost to the military.
