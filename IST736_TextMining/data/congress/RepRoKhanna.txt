Self-regulation is no longer an option. Any legislation must be crafted in conversation with tech companies, academics, non profits, and lawmakers.
In the digital economy, small town jobs can and should include high tech jobs. Tech needs to commit to creating jobs and hiring rural employees. If we prioritize teaching practical skills and building national high speed internet, jobs will follow.
