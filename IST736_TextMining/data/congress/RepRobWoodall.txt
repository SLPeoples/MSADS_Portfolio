(3/3) With everything that has happened, it is easy to be cynical about the state of affairs for our nation. We need to remember that there is much more that unites us as Americans than divides us.

Each of us is failing at our job if we can’t work together and secure our southern border and put our public servants back to work.
The House passed Speaker Pelosi’s version of a funding bill, the Senate rejected @SenSchumer’s version of a funding bill, the Senate rejected the current proposal from the President @realDonaldTrump, and refusing to sit at the negotiating table fails to move the ball forward.
We’ve tried it both ways now in the Senate, and it is clear that work is required between the @POTUS and Congressional leaders, and we need @SpeakerPelosi to come back to the table.
The secret to finding common ground isn’t to ask “Why don’t you agree with me?” The only movement I’ve seen in this debate is from @POTUS who has proposed a solution to re-open the government. @SpeakerPelosi, let's work together to #SecureOurBorder.

The intent of Congress has been clear: no taxpayer dollars should support abortion—period.  It was clear when I voted to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion in the 2018 spending bill, and I’m pleased to see the @POTUS's decision today. #TitleX
Providing long-term certainty for Georgia's farmers is a priority – and I’m proud to support this measure today. #2018FarmBill
On Peace Officers Memorial Day, we’re reminded of the tremendous sacrifice made by so many in service to their neighbors. We’re forever grateful for these brave men and women, as well as their remarkable families. #PeaceOfficersMemorialDay #NationalPoliceWeek
Pleased to see the @StateDept and @POTUS reach a resolution on #OpenSkies – protecting American jobs from unfair foreign government practices such as issuing large subsidies to their own airlines.
Happy #MothersDay to all the mothers across our community – especially my mom – today! I hope it’s a wonderful day for everyone!
The 2nd public hearing of the Joint Select Committee on #Budget and Appropriations #ProcessReform is happening now. Tune in here:
More evidence of a resurgent #economy. Job openings hit a record high at 6.6M! #jobs #growth MORE:
Per @WSJ, "Unemployment in the U.S. fell in April to one of the lowest levels of the post-World War II era, the result of a historically long jobs expansion that shows little evidence of slowing." Can't think of more fitting news for the end of a great #SmallBusinessWeek.
Tonight I'm in @PtreeCorners with the business association talking #TaxReform #Transportation and more. Thanks for your partnership for inviting me to be with you! #SmallBusinessWeek
I recently had the pleasure of visiting with one of the many remarkable small businesses here in #GA07, which also happens to be the Small Manufacturer of the Year Award winner in Forsyth County! Congratulations again to #Metcam! #SmallBusinessWeek
Thanks for having me, @Veritiv! Always great to see the impressive things our #GA07 businesses are doing!
If you own a small business and have ever wondered what you can deduct for tax purposes, the #IRS has the first of several webinars this week to provide more information. #SmallBusinessWeek Register here:
Thanks to @SenatorIsakson and everyone who made the day such a success!
Wishing the @We_Are_GSMST National Science Bowl Regional champions the best of luck in the Finals taking place in DC now and over coming days! We're proud of you - keep up the great work! @DOE_SC_NSB #NSB2018
A productive week on Capitol Hill capped off today w/ the House overwhelmingly passing a 5-year #FAA reauthorization bill that moves America and #GA07 forward in big ways. #FAA2018 @Transport MORE:
Great to have you in town, @GwinnettChamber!
Managing the combined rule on the @HouseFloor today. #FAA

#TaxDay2018 is behind us, and we’ve made great progress on #taxreform…but we’re not done. This week I had the opportunity to share more about why I believe the #FairTax is the answer. @FairTaxOfficial
Headed to the @HouseFloor to talk #FairTax. #TaxDay may be behind us this year, but the #FairTaxMeansFreedom from it altogether. We can make it just another beautiful spring day. #HR25
#TaxDay is here again thankfully it is the last Tax Day under the old, broken tax code. That said, my ultimate goal is still to do away with Tax Day altogether, HR25, the #FairTax, does that. @FairTaxOfficial @TeamCavuto @Varneyco #TaxDay2018
Great discussion. Thanks again, @ACEC_National @ACECGA #ACECAnnual2018 #Engineering #infrastructureinamerica
RT @MichaelLSully: Looking forward to hearing from @RepRobWoodall this morning at the @ACEC_National 2018 Spring Conference. @ACECGA #gapol…
Grateful to @SenatorIsakson for his leadership and service. Looking forward to another successful Academy Day!
As reported by the @WSJ according to the @USDOL, "The number of Americans claiming new unemployment benefits has never been so low for so long." Great progress, just getting started!
It was one of the darkest episodes in human history, and by remembering – paying tribute to those lost and those who endured – we help guard future generations from such tragedy. #HolocaustRemembranceDay
Grateful for your service and friendship, @SpeakerRyan! Looking forward to continuing our work the remainder of this year.
A 21st century #infrastructure system requires a streamlined, efficient regulatory process that no longer stands in the way of progress. Excited to see this Administration partnering with Congress to do just that. @WhiteHouse #infrastructureinamerica
