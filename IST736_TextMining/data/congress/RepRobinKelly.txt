On #InternationalWomensDay, we’re reminded that millions of girls are prevented from going to school or getting an education. I’m proud that Congress came together to target our efforts so ALL girls can go to school and learn.
On this week’s #RobinsRemix, I focus on three important bills passed by @HouseDemocrats over the last two weeks: ethics reform #votingrights expansion legislation (#HR1) and #gunviolence prevention bills (#HR8 #HR1112).
#Maternalmortality has become a crisis in America. More mom die today than 25 years ago. It’s time to take a hard look at this data and develop protocols to prevent these unnecessary deaths. #MOMMAact
He’s right. Our criminal justice system is fundamentally broken. If you’re rich and well-connected, you get a slap on the wrist. If you’re black, brown or poor, the book gets thrown at you. It’s simply wrong.
This is great news! It’s more dangerous to have a baby today than it was 25 years ago. This research is part of the solution to addressing rising #maternalmortality. #MOMMAact
Looks like we can add this to the @WashingtonPost’s running list. Where is he at now? 9,014+?
Perhaps @POTUS should listen to General Kelly.

GOOD! Despite Sec. @BetsyDeVosED’s best efforts to throw defrauded students, inc. many #veterans, to the wolves, the courts have struck down her illegal action.
The #TrumpTradeWar has failed, plain and simple. American consumers and family farmers have lost a great deal because of @POTUS’ misguided actions.
#GunViolence continues to have a disproportionate and negative impact on our nation’s children. It’s past time for Congress to act and #DoSomething to save lives. @SenateMajLdr MUST call an IMMEDIATE vote on #HR8.
Thanks to the #GOPTaxScam.
Sometimes you think that you know the entire story but the facts will surprise you. #WomensHistoryMonth #BlackGirlMagic
The @SunTimes is right. Small, commonsense steps can save lives. @HouseDemocrats are committed to saving lives with #gunviolence prevention legislation. We need @HouseGOP to join the fight.
Elected officials should work for their constituents, not lobbyists or political donors. As part of our #ForThePeople agenda, @HouseDemocrats are pushing this anti-corruption package. #HR1
No matter what President @realDonaldTrump says, accountability is NOT a dirty word. The American people deserve to know what their President is doing when he’s supposed to be working for them, not himself, his business or his family.
I’ve always been impressed by @RepPeteKing’s commitment to commonsense, lifesaving #gunviolence prevention efforts. I would encourage everyone to read his wonderful, #bipartisan #OpEd:

I was elected to Congress nearly 6 years ago. In that time, #gunviolence has claimed THOUSANDS of American lives. Today – because @HouseDemocrats are in control – I took my first vote to prevent #gunviolence. We passed #HR8!
Further evidence that there is NO national emergency. It’s nothing but a Presidential tempter tantrum responding to his own manufactured crisis.
Happy birthday to my friend and neighbor @RepKinzinger.
It’s about time! Now, @SenateMajLdr MUST call this bill and save lives.
As the House of Representatives votes on the #Bipartisan Background  Check Act (#HR8), I'm proud to be the presiding officer and facilitate this lifesaving vote. @HouseDemocrats will #DoSomething on #gunviolence.  #IL02Proud
Today, the American people got an opportunity to hear directly from Michael Cohen about his decade-plus relationship with @POTUS. My question was direct and to the point:
The abuse of children is simply wrong. When it occurs while these children are in U.S. custody, we – as a nation – fail and are responsible. It’s past time for @SecNielsen and @SecAzar to answer questions about these abuses and their abusive programs.

With @POTUS in Vietnam, I hope he can win bolder and actionable commitments from #NorthKorea to reduce and dismantle their nuclear program. Diplomacy is the best tool to address this global crisis.

We proudly grow American soybeans in the Second District. However, this misguided and failed #TrumpTradeWar means no markets and no money for local farmers.
Today’s Domestic Gag rule on Title X providers is @POTUS’ latest assault on women’s health. It compromises the ethics of medical professionals and robs the uninsured and underserved Americans of reproductive healthcare.
Under Sec. @BetsyDeVosEd, the Department of Education has been weaponized against our #veterans. This is one of the MANY reasons why I opposed her confirmation.
This miscarriage of justice occurred under the leadership of @USDOL @SecretaryAcosta, when he was the federal prosecutor in Miami. At DOL,  he has an important role in tackling human trafficking. Can he be trusted to fight for victims?

Despite repeated claims that “Mexico will pay for the wall,” Pres. @realDonaldTrump is unconstitutionally declaring a national emergency so he can steal AMERICAN TAXPAYER DOLLARS to pay for HIS wall. SMH. #FakeTrumpEmergency
On this week’s #RobinsRemix, I’m excited to announce that we’ve advanced TWO #gunviolence prevention bills through committee and a bipartisan deal to prevent another #TrumpShutdown.
If President @realDonaldTrump wants to declare a National Emergency, he should start with his White House.

I’m a strong supporter of #HR8 but we can must do more. Yesterday, I’m introducing three commonsense gun safety bills: one would require a @Surgeon_General report, another extends @USCPSC jurisdiction to firearms and the third keeps guns out of the hands of violent individuals.
Further proof that the #GOPTaxScam was for big businesses and the super rich, not every day, middle-class Illinois families.

Since 2016 (and likely before), foreign governments have been working to undermine our democracy. Sadly, President @realDonaldTrump has done NOTHING to prevent future attacks or punish past attacks. It’s time for Congress to step up.

I agree. If nothing else, it’s a perfect example of the most important civics lesson: elections have consequences.
.@POTUS FINALLY came to the table in a responsible manner to join @HouseDemocrats in ending his #TrumpShutdown. It’s time to reopen the gov't get back to work for American families, inc. advancing comprehensive immigration reform, smart border security disaster recovery.
This is a sad example of why Congress MUST work to make healthcare more affordable and accessible.
Tragically, America has seen another mass shooting. It’s time to pass #HR8 and make ourselves and our families safer.
For a “Middle America” President, his Cabinet is woefully out of touch w/ real American families. I’ve been there - I know what it’s like to stand in line at a food bank because you have no other choice; I carry that experience w/ me every day in Congress.

These brave young men sacrificed their lives for our nation. Now, the #TrumpShutdown means that their families won’t receive their death benefits. It’s time for @POTUS to end his temper tantrum and reopen the government.
