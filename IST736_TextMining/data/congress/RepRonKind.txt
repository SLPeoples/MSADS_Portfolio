I’m proud to lead the Healthcare Innovation Caucus, which is promoting  more innovation and more access to care.
Very cool work being done, including:   New software to help understand medical procedure pricing, new technologies to monitor heart health - from your bed, board games that help kids cope with major surgeries, and apps that let you refill prescriptions just by taking a picture!
I’m here at the #InnovationShowcase at the Capitol, checking out the great work happening at the intersection of medical and digital innovation.
Great to see Judge Ramona Gonzalez from La Crosse in D.C. as she testifies for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.I am proud to cosponsor the House bill to reauthorize the #VAWA and will continue to fight to end domestic violence and sexual assault in WI.
Great to join @agritalk to talk about what's up next in the world of trade, stopping these tariffs, and rebuilding our failing infrastructure across our rural communities and up down the Mississippi.  Thanks for having me!

Today, the @WaysMeansCmte held a hearing on the future of infrastructure repair and development across the country. My priorities are yours: better roads, safer bridges and waterways, 5G deployment across our rural communities, and responsible budgeting.
It was an honor to speak at the @Battlefields’s Medal of Honor reception meet Woody Williams, an American hero Medal of Honor recipient who fought courageously in WWII.As Chair of the Battlefield Caucus I will fight to uphold the Trust’s mission: preserve, educate, inspire
- $3 Billion a month in extra taxes - $1.4 Billion a month in wasted economic opportunity - $165 Billion a *year* in lost business This isn't winning - this trade war is a net loss for America's farmers, workers families.
ICYMI: Last week, I introduced a bill that would give Wisconsin medical residents more opportunities to learn and work in community hospitals across our state. Read more here:
301 Tariffs are hurting the bottom-line of Wisconsin businesses, their workers, and consumers. If the Administration won't make an exclusion process, Congress will. Today, I introduced a bipartisan, bicameral bill that will do just that:
Today, the @WaysMeansCmte held a hearing on the U.S.-China Trade Relationship. I spoke about why Wisconsinites need this Admin to lift the tariffs and stop taking a unilateral approach to dealing with bad actors. See more here:
 Outdoor recreation is an important part of the Wisconsin way of life. I'm glad that the #PublicLands package passed and that we'll now have the resources and tools we need to protect our land and pass on our traditions to the next generation.
...and who's losing the trade war? America's workers, farmers and families.
Proud to partner with @RepGallagher to introduce a new bipartisan bill that will help provide more opportunity for medical residencies here in Wisconsin, and ensure our rural communities have the medical professionals they need to stay healthy and strong.
Bipartisan bills like this help us pass on Wisconsin’s outdoor traditions, and ensure the next generation has the opportunity to enjoy all that #Wisconsin has to offer for years to come. 
1/2 - Later today, we’ll vote on a sweeping #PublicLands package that reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund #LWCF, protects land for hunting and fishing, and creates new wilderness across the country. �️
Today, the Grand Canyon celebrates � years as a National Park! Have you visited or hiked the Grand Canyon? Share your favorite National Park memories! #GrandCanyon100 #NPS
Looked like a great Birkebeiner this weekend! Congrats to everyone who made it up to Hayward to race!
Great to meet with student leaders from @UWEauClaire earlier this week. We talked about the important issues facing the next generation of Wisconsinites, and how we can help our students earn a better life by lowering student loan debt and increasing opportunity.
The President’s emergency declaration is distracting Congress from the important issues Wisconsinites care about, and is a gross overreach by one branch of our government. Plain and simple: this isn’t the way it should be done.
Great to stop by Lazy Monk Brewing in Eau Claire today to talk about a new bill I introduced last week that will give our small and craft brewers a fair shot. Cheers to Wisconsin beer!
Thank you to all of our volunteers who battle the Wisconsin winters to keep our fellow Wisconsinites from missing a meal!
Taking action on gun violence and being respectful about Second Amendment rights are not mutually exclusive. Only by working together on this can we prevent these mass shootings from happening. | 2/2
Today, we remember the lives lost in the horrific Parkland shooting. Gun violence cannot be our new normal. It's time to move forward on commonsense gun safety measures in this new Congress, and protect our children and families. | 1/2
This isn't sustainable, and this isn't fair to the next generation. Our kids and grandkids are going to be paying the price for Washington's fiscal irresponsibility for years to
Today, I introduced a bill that will help grow WI craft breweries by reducing tax burdens and restrictive regulations for our brewers. Easier business leads to even more good-paying, meaningful jobs here in WI. We can all cheers to that! �Learn more:

Be safe out there tonight, Wisconsinites!
Yet again, Wisconsinites will be on the hook for the President's trade war.
John’s wise words stuck with me, and I’ve passed his advice along as I mentor new Members here in the House. His wit and wisdom will be missed.
I’ll never forget what John said: You have an important job, but you’re not an important person. The minute you think you are is the minute you cut corners.
When I first came to Congress, John Dingell was one of the first people I sought out for advice.
Tawni and I are saddened to hear about the passing of former Rep. John Dingell.John challenged all of us to come together to make life better for all Americans. His positive attitude will be missed.Our prayers go to Debbie, the Dingell family and our Michigan neighbors tonight.
Great to be on Central Time talking about the issues facing Wisconsinites in rural communities! Listen to the interview here:
Proud to lead a bipartisan, bicameral team in introducing the Trade Security Act of 2019. It is long-past time for Congress to reassert its constitutionally-granted power in our Nation’s #trade policy and protect our export power. Read more here:
We have a problem when it comes to retirement savings. I am proud to introduce the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act, which l will help Wisconsinites grow savings accounts and help us avoid a retirement savings shortfall in the future. #RESA
3/3 I stand ready to work with all of my colleagues to find common ground, and will fight to break down the hyper-partisanship in Congress to make life better for Wisconsinites. There is far more that brings us together than divides us.
2/3 We don’t need a Republican or Democratic agenda – we need an American agenda. I was encouraged to hear bipartisan proposals in tonight’s #SOTU, including a commitment to lowering drug prices, rebuilding our failing infrastructure, and investing in cancer research.
1/3 We can all agree: America needs unity.
Wisconsinites like Ramon are the heart of our rural communities. It is an honor to invite him as a tribute to our first responders and volunteers who work tirelessly to lift our communities higher and move us forward.
I look forward to Ramon Knudtson joining me for the #SOTU. Ramon has dedicated his life to making Wisconsin stronger through his work with the Village of Melrose, the Wisconsin Rural Water Association, and the Melrose Fire Department.
Great to join Scott and Elizabeth at the @LaCrosseTribune for Tribcast, the Tribune's podcast. We talked about the State of the Union, what Washington is up to this week, and the path forward in the 116th Congress. Check it out here �
Check out this feel-good story from La Crosse. Thanks to all of the teachers, support staff and administrators who work every day to ensure our kids learn the important things: "be respectful, responsible and safe."
Proud to introduce the bipartisan, Bicameral Congressional Trade Authority Act. Congress needs to stand up and fight for our rural economies by taking back the trade authorities that, according to our Constitution, clearly belong to the Legislative branch.
Foxconn has a bad track record of breaking promises, and now it's clear that Wisconsin's taxpayers are the ones getting fleeced. If the late, great Senator Bill Proxmire were still alive, the Foxconn project would take home his Golden Fleece Award.
Who woulda guessed?
Stay safe out there today, Wisconsinites. At least it's a dry heat, right?
The fight to protect Wisconsinites with pre-existing conditions is always personal, because it touches so many of our lives. Thank you to @RepGwenMoore for bravely sharing your story with our Committee and the world today. Looking forward to working together to #ProtectOurCare.
WISCONSIN FARMERS: Be sure to check out these important cold-weather tips for livestock and pets from @FabFarmBabe. Stay warm, and stay safe out there this week!
This shutdown cost us $3 Billion, and we'll never get it back. Shutdowns have consequences long after they end, and should NEVER be a negotiating tactic.
2/2 Now it’s time to get in the same room and work together to find commonsense, bipartisan solutions that effectively fix our broken immigration system.
1/2 Reopening the government is the right first step to moving forward from this embarrassing shutdown - but this short-term compromise bill cannot lead to another shutdown.  The federal government and its workers should never be used by anyone as hostages for a policy goal.
Wisconsin farmers, workers and families can't afford more tariffs, and are suffering the consequences of this trade war. This bill - and the administration's bad trade policy - will hurt our rural economy and America's heartland.
Wilbur Ross, who spent a decade reporting a nearly $3 BILLION net worth, doesn't understand why Wisconsin's federal workers contractors, farmers, and families can't afford this shutdown. Talk about out of touch.
In Case You Missed It: Yesterday, I unveiled my plan to reopen the federal government. Check it out here:
It’s time we create a pathway to citizenship that funds border modernization and stops the inflow of drugs into our country, while promoting the legal immigration that Wisconsin’s farmers, businesses and communities need. Read more here:
There is no question that our immigration system is broken and badly in need of repair. Instead of refusing to work together, I’m proposing a compromise: commonsense solutions to the problems that we face, and at no cost to Wisconsinites.
Wisconsin's breweries contribute to our local economy and our state's culture. This shutdown is threatening the ability to sell our beer across state lines, and is hurting our businesses.  
The shutdown is hurting Wisconsin farmers, businesses and families. Both sides need to get in the same room and have a meaningful discussion about how to move forward. Let’s reopen the government and get serious about 21st-century border security.
"It’s just one more punch in the gut farmers have to overcome.” The shutdown and the consequences of this trade war are hitting Wisconsin's rural economy especially hard. Enough is enough.
ATTN. WI Farmers impacted by Shutdown: FSA offices in Grant, Vernon Monroe Counties will be open on 1/17, 1/18. and 1/22 to help with processing FSA payments, and cont. expiring financing statements. Call my office 1-888-442-8040 or click here:
#Tariffs on US exports continue to threaten the success of our rural economy. Companies need an exclusion process now, before things get worse. Wisc farmers workers eagerly await the day the tariffs are lifted and this Admin’s trade war comes to an end.
#OnThisDay 90 years ago, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was born. Today we celebrate Dr. King’s life, and honor his fight for equality and justice for all people.

(3/3) In the 116th Congress and beyond, I will continue to fight to ensure Wisconsinites have access to high quality, affordable healthcare. The nonstop partisan attacks on the health and wellbeing of our families need to stop. #ProtectOurCare
(2/3) The lawsuit threatens to strike down the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and it’s protections over 2.4 million Wisconsinites living with pre-existing conditions.
(1/3) Yesterday, I voted to protect Wisconsinites’ healthcare by helping pass a resolution that strengthens Congress’s hand to intervene in Texas v. U.S., an appalling lawsuit previously led by Brad Schimel and Scott Walker.
Today is #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay. Thank you to the men women who put their lives on the line to protect us. As the brother of a police officer, I know firsthand the hard work dedication our Law Enforcement shows to our communities every day.  Thank you!
Congratulations, Gwen! It will be great to have another Wisconsinite on the @WaysMeansCmte. It’s time to move Wisconsin - and America - forward.
Meanwhile in Wisconsin, a family farmer got his bailout check...it was $2.00. This is no way to treat America's farmers.
Wisconsin has lost $139 million to import tariffs since this Administration got its hands on trade and started this unnecessary trade war. In what world would this be a good idea?
I am proud to cosponsor the For the People Act, a bill that puts the power back where it belongs: in the hands of Wisconsinites. #HR1
The longer we let this shutdown continue, the more it jeopardizes our national security and the economic growth that we need right now in this country.
A trade war, low commodity prices, major farm consolidation - and now a government shutdown. Wisconsin's family farmers shouldn't be used as pawns, and can't afford the chaos caused by this shutdown. This needs to end.
Today, we enter a new chapter in our representative democracy. Progress is only possible in a divided government if we put our differences aside and work together to move Wisconsin – and America - forward. #116thCongress

Don't be fooled: This Farm Bill wasn't created with Wisconsin's small and family farmers in mind. 
(3/3) I can’t support a bill that maintains the failed status quo. As long as family farmers are fighting for their lives in Wisconsin, I will continue to fight for them in this Farm Bill. #farmbill2018
(2/3) and in Chicago and San Francisco. It cuts $800 million from vital conservation programs, and does nothing to address the damage caused by the President’s trade war.
(1/3) This Farm Bill maintains a status quo that will drive more family farmers out of business. It fails to rein in wasteful subsidies and crop insurance programs that lead to overproduction by big Agribusiness, and sends taxpayer dollars to billionaires on Wall Street,

Wisconsinites working to rebuild their homes, farms businesses after severe storms deserve the same federal disaster assistance as those who caught the attention of the national media...but Wisconsin is excluded from the federal tax recovery package on the House floor tomorrow.
Wisconsin farmers want trade - not aid. This is a drop in the bucket compared to the losses that Wisconsin farmers have seen since the tariffs were imposed. The President's self-inflicted trade war is hurting our state, and our economy.

Our students are our future, and Wisconsin is in great hands. This week, I talked with Cassville High students about the importance of being a lifelong learner, protecting the outdoors, and treating our classmates and neighbors with respect.
“It’s been catastrophic.” Wisconsin manufacturers and farmers know that nobody wins in a trade war. The President's tariffs are hurting Wisconsin families and our rural economy.
The President’s declaration will be a welcome relief for many Wisconsinites who have been flooded out of their homes and businesses. I look forward to continuing to work with FEMA to ensure the additional federal resources are well-utilized.

Wisconsin farmers and businesses are being forced to come to Washington on bended knee, begging for exclusions from Trump's tariffs, while some get bailouts. Family farmers want trade - not aid.

WI farmers aren’t looking for government hand-outs - they just want market access and the opportunity to compete. This temporary and expensive fix will right a wrong that was inflicted by the President himself, and could be lifted at any time.

30 states still lack discrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans, proving that the fight for equality is far from over. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of the Equality Act, which will help move Wisconsin and America forward. #EqualityForward
Now more than ever, America needs to give respect and decency a shot. This week, try having a beer with a neighbor you don't usually agree with. It may not be the easy way, but it’s the Wisconsin way.
Five years ago, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in its Shelby County v. Holder decision, but there is a solution. Today, I’m urging Congress to #RestoreTheVOTE by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act.
The Farm Bill that passed today lavishes millions of dollars of taxpayer subsidies on big agribusinesses cuts vital conservation programs at the expense of family farmers. We need a Farm Bill that will work for our family farmers in WI – not for powerful special interests in DC
No question that our immigration system is broken in need of repair, but separating families is wrong. It has never been the policy of our Nation to use children as political pawns. I am proud to support the #KeepFamiliesTogetherAct to stop this practice reunite families.
The keystone of our democracy is holding the power to choose our representatives - not the other way around. The U.S. Supreme Court's delayed decision on fair voting maps is disappointing, but not the end of the fight.
"Instead of a go-it-alone approach, the United States should work with our allies to create a comprehensive strategy to bring China to the table to address these issues, and protect Wisconsin jobs." Read my full statement here:
Today, I celebrated #FlagDay with the family of Bob Garber, from Prescott. I am honored to present this flag to his family in Bob's memory hope that it serves as a reminder of Bob's dedication to WI our great country. Check out for more pics.
Today, the oldest branch of the U.S. military turns 243.  Happy Birthday @USArmy, and thank you to all of our Servicemembers and Veterans who have served.  #ArmyBDay
ICYMI: "Their policy and their strategy shifts from minute to minute and it creates a lot of uncertainty out there, not only with the countries with whom we’re negotiating but with people back home, from farmers to manufacturers and even consumers." @WPR
As a lifelong Wisconsinite, I know that one of the most important bills for growing our local economy and supporting small and family farms is the Farm Bill. Yesterday, I released my 2018 Farm Bill Priorities Report, which you can find on my website:
If you have ideas about how Congress or the #ClimateSolutionsCaucus can help with the conservation effort, don’t hesitate to reach out to my office and make your voice heard. Conserving our environment today leads to a healthier #Wisconsin tomorrow.
These tariffs are a direct response to the President’s short-sighted trade decisions. It’s time that we stop treating our allies like our enemies, and set trade standards that support Wisconsin jobs.
There are no winners in trade wars — only losers. The impacts on American manufacturers and the retribution exacted upon American farmers and ranchers will be substantial, costing us more jobs than will be saved. It's time for Congress to reclaim its powers over trade policies.
Happy Pride Month to all of the LGBTQ people allies in western and central Wisconsin. Proud to fight for equality and inclusivity today, and every day! #Equality #PrideMonth
Everyone loses in a trade war. This news is only the beginning of an unnecessary and costly conflict with our closest trading partners.
Happy Dairy Month to everyone in Wisconsin, and thank you to our hardworking dairy farmers and farm families! You make Wisconsin America's Dairyland!
Whether we’re canoeing on the Kickapoo or sitting in a tree-stand, Tawni I have always loved getting outside with our boys. It’s my hope that we can carry on these outdoor traditions for years to come which is why I’m a proud new member of the bipartisan #ClimateSolutionsCaucus
The consequences of this shortsighted decision will be widespread across WI, and will immediately threaten jobs in industries and businesses Wisconsin is proud of, like cranberries, breweries and manufacturers.
One of my favorite summer traditions is driving across Wisconsin with my family to local county dairy breakfasts. Check out the link below to find a dairy breakfast near you!
My office is looking for a wounded warrior or medically retired veteran for a paid Fellowship position in my La Crosse office.Interested veterans should go to search “Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program” for more information and how to apply.
Great to see college/business partnerships, like Mason's internship opportunity he had at @Skyward_Inc and @UWStevensPoint. Congrats to Mason, and all of our Wisconsin graduates! #WIProud
