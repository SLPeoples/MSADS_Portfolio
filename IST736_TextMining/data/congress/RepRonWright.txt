In an effort to fund their elections with taxpayer $ 234 of my colleagues just voted for #HR1 The bill is an abomination plain and simple. It takes away more freedom of speech and socializes taxpayer money. Oh and apparently the Dems still hate the president! #NOTforthePeopleAct
You have it and we won’t stop helping until we bring him home! #FreeMajd
I may have to start listening to podcasts now.
I am opposed to any slander of religion, no matter what religion it is. But this [resolution] merely diverts attention from the inappropriate assault on Judaism by Congresswoman Omar.#ForeignAffairs
Worth a NO vote for this alone! #HR1 #DemocratProtectionAct
Its time to #SecureOurBorder. Use whatever phrase you want but this is unsustainable!
Excellent op ed by my colleague.
@SoccerMouaz It truly is.
Such a sad situation. My heart weeps for the families affected and I am praying for healing. #AlabamaStrong
@POTUS removing PP funding sure helped the health of unborn women! I applaud this move and look forward to seeing more from President Trump on this issue. There is no greater cause than fighting for the unborn. #prolife #EndAbortionNow
Happy Birthday to a member of the greatest generation! #neverforget their sacrifice. #WWII
My allegiance is solely to the United States but I stand with #Israel as a beacon of democracy in the Middle East. #ForeignAffairsCommittee
To my colleague Congresswoman Omar, no one is asking you to swear allegiance to Israel but it would be nice if you would support the same principles they exude for their people! Freedom, liberty and human rights. #ForeignAffairsCommittee
Done! #HugAGIDay
“I would rather be exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than to those attending too small a degree of it.” - Thomas Jefferson  #liberty
Greater freedom and opportunity is a very good thing. Pleased to co-sponsor the Education Freedom Scholarship and Opportunity Act with my colleague @RepByrne  #EducationFreedom
It is absolutely #unconscionable to think that Dems would block an amendment that seeks to protect children from sexual predators at school job sight locations. Yet! they did. I will always fight for the safety of our school children! #education
Just finished meeting with the family of Majd Kamalmaz. Majd is being held in Syria and we are fighting to bring him home! Pictured here is his dear wife, two daughters, sister and one of his sons. Their courage and perseverance is inspiring! My prayer is that we will #FreeMajd
This country was founded on freedom of choice not mandates! The Green New Deal, or as my friend and colleague puts it here, “The Green Socialist Deal” will remove that little thing called freedom from the people. It must be stopped #nogreennewdeal #thisisanoutrage
Proud to join @RepAndyBiggsAZ   and my fellow co-sponsors recognizing the #nationaldebt as a national security crisis! To remain a voice in the world for good we must exude moral courage as a body and pass a balanced budget. We must stop spending outside of our means. #debt
Democrats will not give up until they destroy the president. They even resort to the testimony of an admitted liar.                                            How low is that? #CohenCongressionalTestimony #charade
Mr. Cohen, since you have lied to Congress before why should we trust you now? #charade
I put up an amendment today in the Ed Labor Committee requiring schools benefiting from an infrastructure bill we were hearing to adopt and abide by a policy that would not allow convicted sexual predators to work on job sites at these schools #education
Exactly! #MichaelCohen
Unconscionable is correct! When partisan divide overtakes common sense the purpose for which we were sent here is lost completely.
I pray for the day when all abortions are illegal in this country and every life, born and unborn at any stage, is defended to the full extent of the law. #EndAbortion
Thank you to @SenSasse for brining this before the Senate. We must continue the fight for the defense of all life! #EndAbortion
Senate Dems who voted against Senator Sasse “Born Alive” legislation, showed just how despicable and low they really are. When an infant is born alive it should not have to worry about being provided the protections that each of us take for granted every day! #EndAbortion
Thank you @MarkArchibald7 for the chance to swing by and chat about what is happening in DC and the the early days of being a congressman.
I like his parents values and have to say this is a cause I can get behind! This young man understands the need to #SecureOurBorder better than a lot of elected officials I know!
Last week I joined 14 other Texas Members in voting "no" on this latest spending bill. This spending bill does not make our communities any safer, secure the border, or do anything to reign in spending. Texans must stand up to Washington and demand better. #SecureOurBorder
@tarrantgop thank you for hosting a wonderful event Saturday evening. The Lincoln Day Dinner was a great success. We must stand strong together to protect freedom and the American way! #gop
A fav little town in my district is up for an award and we need your help. It is the only #Texas town in the top five of this seasons Small Business Revolution! vote right now for Corsicana! Let’s put them over the top of voting. #smallbusinessrevolution
The conference committee should have properly funded the wall and our #bordersecurity cause if not the president will do their jobs for them. We can not negotiate with the security of the American people! #SecureOurBorder
UTA is providing exactly what we need from our institutions of public higher education, by enrolling and graduating more students annually, keeping college affordable and maintaining the highest standards of excellence - Read all about it below!
Joined my colleagues today in co-sponsoring this legislation. We must always honor the heroes who have sacrificed so much for our freedom!
Today my office sent a letter to @SecPompeo urging him to do everything in his power to bring Majd Kamalmaz home from Syria where he is being held. I was honored to host his son @KKamalmaz and sign the letter in his presence! Thank you @RepFrenchHill for signing with me #freemajd
Comments like those of my colleague Ilhan Omar are not just insensitive they are Anti-Semitic and bigoted! She should apologize immediately. #IlhanOmar #Israel
Strong support last night for the work being done by @AIPAC We must always stand with Israel and do everything we can to strengthen their standing in the world. Also great to meet and talk with an ally in this battle Sen. Lieberman. #Israel

My heart is heavy to learn of the passing of Arlington Police Chaplin Harold Elliot. He was a good man and a friend of mine. He was loved by all and will be dearly missed. @ArlingtonPD
@kketb Wearing my pin today in to highlight the #Enditmovement
Attending a round table with the Estonian Ambassador discussing Russian aggression and ways to combat it. #ForeignAffairs
@momisaverb So important that we as members of Congress keep our priorities straight! I am saddened as well to see any hatred for a prayer breakfast.
Sitting with representatives from Pakistan, Uganda, Namibia, and Greece at the National #PrayerBreakfast this morning.
If My people who are called by My name will humble themselves, and pray and seek My face, and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin and heal their land. 2 Chron 7:14 #PrayerBreakfast Great to see so many colleagues this morning!
RT @EdLaborGOP: Republican Leader @virginiafoxx talks with tipped workers who would lose their jobs in a $15 fed min wage hike. Oddly, they…
Enjoyed hosting you in my office. I am looking forward to working with our good friends to the north.
When a servant falls we should remember and honor them. Godspeed Agent Doss. #BorderPatrol
@POTUS was very clear about his vision for America! #ChooseGreatness #SOTU2019
@POTUS was very clear with his vision for America’s future. On the issues that matter most, protecting freedom and the American people, he is unwavering. He showed strength on border security, and on national security! Keep it up sir! #SOTU2019
I was heartened to hear @POTUS strong stance in favor of the unborn and innocent life. Promoting a culture that protects and honors life is essential to the moral fabric of our country. What the states of New York and Virginia have done and are supporting is abominable #SOTU19
I am looking forward to attending President Trumps' second #SOTU Address. It will air at 9pm EST Make sure to tune in.
Medicare for all is Medicare for none! The socialist healthcare system that many Democrats are talking about would destroy future healthcare for the very people they profess to protect and the only thing that Democrats’ socialized medicine will equalize is misery. #healthcare
My prayers and heartfelt thanks for her service. May she rest in peace.
Thank you for hosting us today. Great time spent with people who are working to strengthen business in all of Texas. Enjoyed spending time with my colleagues as well.
RT @RepMarkWalker: .@RalphNortham, third trimester babies want to finish their term as well.
304,000 Jobs added in January! More jobs, better wages for more workers and a number that far succeeds the experts estimates for last month. #winning #jobsreport
Thanks to the Chamber for having me. Great to see local friends.
@MKamalmaz @RepFrenchHill I will be working with my colleagues to help in any way I can to free your father. #FreeMajd
Proud to join Friends of a Free and Democratic Syria Caucus. Also joining my colleague @RepFrenchHill and calling for the release of Majd Kamalmaz, a constituent of mine being held in Syria #FreeMajd
#SecureOurBorder
Grateful to hear that the Committee on Natural Resources voted to keep "so help you God" in the witness oath. #congress #faith
The #Democrats sitting on the  House Committee on Natural Resources have decided to remove "So help me God" from the witness oath. We have seen blatant anti catholic and anti-Semitic moves by Dems and this is just another step in that direction. #congress #faith
@ski4me1 @HouseForeignGOP Thank you! I will keep them awake.
Work got underway at my first Foreign Affairs Committee meeting today. Let’s get to it. @HouseForeignGOP
Preach! My space heater is turned to high in preparation. #PolarVortex2019
God bless #Texas
This is very concerning and erodes confidence in our elections. I applaud the Secretary of State and Attorney General for looking into this, and I hope they’re quickly able to get to the bottoms of this.
This is a great story. Texans showed up today! #TexasVeterans
May we never forget. 74 years ago as of yesterday. #Auschwitz
If you live in Navarro County this is very important for you! Get connected to the emergency alert system. You can text NAVARRO to 888777 to opt-in. @ericrmeyers thank you for your work on this!
The smugness and condescension of Pelosi and Schumer was inappropriate ... Talk of who won or lost is premature because the fight to secure the border and protect the American people is not over. I am grateful that workers will now be paid. Lets secure the border #SecureOurBorder
Democrat Leadership can’t stand the thought of allowing @POTUS to speak before the American people while the gov is shutdown! The same Leadership that is using border security as a bargaining chip. Stop the grandstanding Madam Speaker and start negotiating. #SecureOurBorder
Grateful to be serving with these members!
Thankfully Israel has an excellent missile defense program Iranian forces would have succeeded in killing many civilians! Congress must continue to stand with Israel and make sure they have the support they need. #StandwithIsrael #Israel
This weekend @POTUS proved once again that he is ready to negotiate. Sadly the democrats showed they are more interested in continuing to play petty politics than securing our citizens future. It’s time to stop using our nations security as a bargaining chip. #SecureOurBorder
Grateful the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals got it right! #sanctityoflifesunday #prolife #marchforlife

Thankful for the thousands who gathered to march for life today in DC and for all those who are fighting for the lives of the unborn around the country. I will always fight to protect the unborn! #MarchForLife #ProLife
� Your move Madam Speaker #SecureOurBorder
Thanks for the highlight! It was a good day. Aggie students past and present are always welcome in our office! #GigEm #TX06 #AggieIMPACTS
No Texas Congressional office is complete without a big ol’ Texas Flag! #Texas
Yesterday I introduced my first Resolution before the House on #ReligiousFreedomDay HR 47 affirms that the United States of Americans stands united in condemning anti-Semitism in any form. #UnitedWeStand
Thanks @MarkDavis for having me on his show last week to talk about what it’s like to be a freshman congressman, life in the minority and my thoughts on the shutdown. We have a lot of work to do but my focus is on serving the interest of the 6th District.
Walls work! #SecureOurBorder
Congratulations to our Texas @GovAbbott and Lt. Gov @DanPatrick on their inauguration today. God bless Texas. #TexasStrong
@POTUS compromise has included things dems asked for but they still refuse to come to the table. With every refusal they will continue to own this shutdown. Effective compromise only succeeds if both sides work out a solution without sacrificing border security! #SecureOurBorder
The Democrats are nowhere to be found in Washington this weekend but I’m here in case they want to begin actual negations with the @POTUS #SecureOurBorder
My thoughts and prayers are with the Arlington Police Department and especially the officer who was shot last night. One more example of how dangerous their jobs are protecting the rest of us.
Yesterday standing next to a steel wall Jim Acosta made @POTUS point for him from McAllen, TX saying that the absence of migrants was proof that the border crisis was fake. His report did prove one thing - where there’s a wall there is no crisis. #SecureOurBorder
RT @cspan: President Trump, @JohnCornyn, @SenTedCruz receive #BorderSecurity briefing - LIVE on C-SPAN3
I fully support the president’s insistence on funding for border security. I understand the difficulty that Democratic intransigence is causing many federal workers, therefore, I will defer my own
My heartfelt thanks to all law enforcement officers and Personel who protect and serve the people of the 6th District. We are blessed by your sacrifice and that of your family. God bless each of you. #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay
@momisaverb Thank you!
The safety and security of the American people should never be used as a bargaining chip. #SecureOurBorder
President Trump understands border security is essential to keeping Americans safe and preserving our sovereignty.#SecureOurBorder
America should be a welcoming, hospitable refuge for people who are seeking to better their lives and raise their families in a safe place. We are a nation of laws and those laws protect those who become citizens legally. #governmentshutdown #BorderSecurity
At the White House Speaker Pelosi dismissed Sec. Nielsen’s presentation by saying, “I reject your facts.” Sorry Madam Speaker, you are welcome to your own opinion, but you are not welcome to your own set of facts. The facts are what they are. #governmentshutdown #BorderSecurity
We could have continued the debate about responsibly for the partial shutdown. But by requiring a new precondition for going forward such as ending the shutdown first, the Democrats now own it. #GovernmentShutdown #BorderSecurity
Speaker Pelosi proclaiming the wall is immoral is reckless and theologically groundless. How grand it must be to proclaim new standards of morality whenever it benefits a political objective! #governmentshutdown #BorderSecurity
Last night I joined @trish_regan show on @FoxBusiness to talk about the government shutdown and the failure of the Democrats to put the security of the American people first. @MelissaAFrancis #governmentshutdown #BorderSecurity
Well said by my Texas colleague. Also why would Dems be so anxious to ignore the safety of American citizens in favor of illegal immigrants? It’s time to put our citizens safety first! #FundTheWall
@unlobodelnorte Thank you!
Later this evening I will be on Fox Business Network. Tune in at 8 pm. We will be discussing the government shutdown and border security. #GovernmentShutdown
