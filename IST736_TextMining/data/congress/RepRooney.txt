Congressman Francis Rooney statement on federal water quality efforts:
Bringing key Congressional appropriators to tour our Everglades and waterways is getting results - $514 million (most ever) to speed dike repairs and reduce harmful discharges, and $115 million for CERP projects that will provide permanent water quality solutions.
In addition to yesterday’s announcement of $514 million to fix the dike around Lake O., we are on track to receive $115 million for Everglades Restoration Projects. Included is beginning construction on the EAA reservoir, a water storage and filtering area south of the lake.
•Working with @FLGovScott, @MarioDB, and @TomRooney to finally get $514 million appropriated to complete dike repairs years ahead of schedule will result in fewer water releases from Lake O., and better water quality in the Gulf. Thank you!
