Today, I proudly voted for #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, which will restore Americans' voting rights, clean up corruption, get dark money out of politics, and end partisan redistricting. I urge the Senate to pass this bill and help us restore Americans’ faith in government.
25 years ago, Congress enacted the Violence Against Women Act -- a key victory in our work to end domestic violence and sexual assault in America, and to help protect survivors. I was proud to stand in support of today's bill to reauthorize #VAWA continue its vital missions.
Our House Majority is working to address the terrible consequences of #GunViolence in our communities. I spoke with witnesses about gaps in firearm research at today’s gun violence research hearing in the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee. @AppropsDems

I hope ICE and CBP will continue to offer details of the circumstances behind this tragic loss; we must have nothing less than a full accounting of the circumstances surrounding this tragic event, including the government’s actions.
Any death in custody is a tragedy, and the loss mourned by this mother is no exception.  That is why we included hundreds of millions of dollars for proper care of migrants in CBP custody as part of the DHS conference agreement that just became law.

Great visit at #HuntingtonPark’s Lucille Roybal-Allard Elementary! Students gave me a robot coding demonstration the student council organized an interview with me. So much fun to learn from our young people, and to share with them some of my experiences as their congresswoman.
The president admitted he “didn’t need to” declare a national emergency, but he declared one anyway as his latest stunt to build his border wall. I’m proud to support @JoaquinCastroTX’s resolution to terminate the president's #FakeEmergency.

Our FY 2019 DHS conference bill makes many smart and effective investments in our border security, and I will continue to fight for those investments in FY 2020.
Instead of funding Trump’s so-called emergency wall, we must hire more customs officers; keep deploying effective border security tech; hire more law enforcement for opioid, trade, and child exploitation investigations; and ensure our Coast Guard can protect U.S. interests.
The president was unable to get Mexico to pay for his border wall, so he shut down our government and cut off pay for 800,000 hardworking U.S. federal employees. Now he'll reportedly announce an emergency action to address a crisis that does not exist.
The only emergency at our border has been the capacity of @CBP to care for migrant families and children who are temporarily in their custody after fleeing violence in their home countries. Trump’s border wall does absolutely nothing to solve that problem.
I support our conference committee's agreement to #KeepGovernmentOpen. It is not ideal, but it makes our immigration system more humane, it supports many smart and effective border security policies, and it supports govt funding for initiatives important to Dems and GOP alike.

America needs an agenda that works #ForThePeople, and that is exactly what our new House Democratic majority is working tirelessly to deliver: lower health care prescription drug costs, higher wages for U.S. workers by rebuilding our infrastructure, cleaning up DC corruption.
Just attended the #SOTU. Unfortunately, despite the president's occasional gestures tonight toward bipartisanship and unity, he has failed to support the middle class, he has failed to unify our nation, and he has failed to afford basic dignity to countless men, women children.

The president should never have shut down the govt in the first place.  He Senate Leader McConnell have spent 35 days forcing stress, fear financial pain on so many of our fellow Americans, holding them hostage to the #TrumpShutdown's deeply ill-conceived unpopular demands.

Amazing letter from 5 former #HomelandSecurity secretaries in support of funding #DHS. Today, the House passed my CR to reopen DHS ensure back pay for its workers. This was the 10th time @HouseDemocrats voted to #EndTheShutdown and reopen govt. POTUS @SenateGOP must join us!

Looking forward to working together!
As #HomelandSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee Chair, I will keep fighting to ensure that every component of #DHS is heard and respected – and that they conduct themselves with the utmost decency and spend taxpayer dollars wisely.
We are at a deeply consequential moment for our #DHS Approps Subcmte and for DHS itself. The department faces urgent funding demands on many fronts, and the Trump Admin has too often demanded cruel, ineffective, and wasteful policies that simply do not help us keep America safe.
I am honored my colleagues have chosen me to serve as the new chair of the #HomelandSecurity Appropriations Subcommittee, and as the first #Latina Appropriations Subcommittee Chair in U.S. history!
The House just passed my legislation to reopen #DHS ensure its workers get their back pay. @HouseDemocrats have voted 10 times to #EndTheShutdown. POTUS @SenateGOP must stop using #FederalWorkers' families as bargaining chips join us NOW to reopen govt without conditions.

Proud to co-lead a resolution saluting our nation’s 53,000 Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists for the expertise and compassion they provide to millions of patients in need of anesthesia each year. #CRNAweek
I am pleased that UTLA and LAUSD have reached an agreement to end the teachers' strike! All students should have the best possible education, and LA Unified teachers have made crucial headway in ensuring their students get the resources and support they need.

Appalled that five Supreme Court justices voted to enable Donald Trump’s bigotry and let him ban transgender people from serving in our military. This attack on our patriotic troops and military readiness is offensive and outrageous. #ProtectTransTroops
ALERT FOR #CA40 COMMUNITIES: Caltrans is scheduled to close lanes, on/off ramps and connectors this week for a road resurfacing bridge widening project on I-710 between Atlantic Blvd and SR 60. Bandini Blvd will be closed under I-710 for bridgework on Monday Tuesday evenings.
On this #MLKDay, we honor the Rev. Dr. King's visionary efforts to ensure every American can enjoy the blessings of freedom, justice equality. In our turbulent times, his message vision continue to inspire us. We must never stop fighting to build a world worthy of his dream.
Air traffic controllers, food inspectors, TSA workers and more are going without pay because of the president's irresponsible, wasteful #TrumpShutdown. @HouseDemocrats have voted to #EndTheShutdown and reopen government. When will Republican leaders join us?
As original #DreamAct co-author, I know we must offer real, permanent protections for #Dreamers. Once govt reopens, I look fwd to POTUS's support for helping those harmed by Trump Admin attacks on #DACA – but honest negotiations CANNOT happen while POTUS holds the govt hostage.
Once we #EndTheShutdown and reopen government, members of both parties can work to reach agreement on true border security, on protecting our Dreamers and TPS recipients, and on reforming all broken elements of our immigration system.
House Democrats have voted over and over again to #EndTheShutdown and reopen the govt without wasting billions on the president’s wall. House Democrats will continue to do so next week. I urge POTUS @SenateGOP to join us in passing legislation to reopen the govt without delay.
The president has prolonged the #TrumpShutdown’s suffering and damage to our nation because he thinks it gives him leverage for a deal to waste billions on his cruel and ineffective border wall.
POTUS proudly claimed he owns the shutdown. Now he owns the fact that the families of 800,000 federal workers are trying to make ends meet without a paycheck. He owns the fact that our food is going uninspected. He owns the fact that small business loans are going unapproved.

As the proud representative for #CA40’s 2,700 federal workers, I’m deeply concerned about the unpaid workers struggling to make ends meet in this shutdown. I've voted 8 times w/House Dems to #EndTheShutdown―@SenateGOP must join us to reopen govt so federal workers get paid again!

When Republicans controlled the House, President Trump may have thought he could get away with this cruelty and incompetence. But those days are over.
Not only did the Trump Administration take thousands more children away from their parents – it failed to keep information about the total number and current status of children separated from their parents or guardians. That’s unconscionable and inexcusable.
