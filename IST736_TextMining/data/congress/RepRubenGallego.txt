Trump wants to take money meant to pay service members vets who dedicate their lives to this country to build his monument to hate. He'll stop at nothing to fulfill his ill-advised campaign promise, all while putting the health, welfare earned benefits of our troops at risk.
The Niger ambush was a complete debacle. To heal and become better, we need the facts.  It's been two years. I expect DoD to provide this information to Congress in short order.
No senior White House official should be able to bypass security checks – no matter who they are related to.My new bill would ensure a tough, thorough vetting process before members of the President's family can get a security clearance.More here:

Another reason why the Telecommunications Denial Order Enforcement Act that @RepGallagher, @ChrisVanHollen, @SenTomCotton and I introduced should be taken up in the House and Senate immediately.
The government shutdown didn't just hurt federal workers - it damaged the entire American economy. But Trump is threatening to shut down the government again in 3 weeks if he doesn't get his way. Republicans need to step up and stop him from inflicting more damage on the economy.
This is a positive step. But there's no reason it should have taken Trump the GOP so long to come to their senses. Federal workers were held hostage for more than a month. They - and the American people - deserve better.
This is important. Glad that this is being settled so that both countries – and the US, via NATO – can move past it.
