Great news for Idaho-- the @DeptVetAffairs has selected Boise VA Medical Center as one of 18 medical centers in the U.S. to implement new policies to reduce errors, prevent patient harm, and empower veterans and families to make health care decisions.
Federal minimum wage is another one-size-fits-all policy that neglects the unique economies and lifestyles of individual states. What works in New Jersey may not work in Idaho. @EdLaborGOP
Congratulations to the new @BLMIdaho State Director John Ruhs-- Looking forward to working together! #ID01

New surveys @SBAList show that most (regardless of location or political party) do not support proposals to allow late term abortions. I support @kevinomccarthy's work to bring up a vote on this issue because Americans deserve to know where their Representatives stand. #ProLife

Subcommittee Assignments just announced! @NatResources @EdLaborCmte
H.R. 676 was introduced by Rep. Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) through the Foreign Affairs Committee. This legislation passed the House of Representatives on January 22, 2019 by a margin of 357 in support, 22 in opposition, and 54 remaining members who chose not to vote.  3/3
20+ countries currently don't pay their dues; in doing so increasing obligations to the U.S. If we remove our own ability to make any changes to our position in the future, we also remove any leverage we could have to hold other nations accountable to pull their own weight. 2/3
I've had a few q's regarding my vote against H.R. 676 (NATO Support Act by Rep. Panetta D-CA) I would like to explain my vote. First, I am not anti-NATO. Second, H.R.676 would empower foreign leaders with too much authority by locking the U.S. into the current terms of NATO.1/3
Celebrating National #SchoolChoice Week! Children deserve the opportunity to be successful in an environment that serves their unique educational needs. Let’s make sure parents have the ability to determine that for their kids! #ID01
Today 13 Democrats joined Republicans in a vote to immediately pay federal workers. Although we are still 8 members short from passing the bill, this number continues to decrease and I am proud to serve with those putting party politics aside to pay federal workers.
Looking forward to chatting with @AlanNathan on @mainstreetradio this afternoon at 3:51pm MST. Tune in here!
I also look forward to joining the @EdLaborCmte. I hope to use this role to empower state and local governments to enrich the educational experience of children in #ID01 ensure our higher education provides the necessary curriculum to support tech and service career paths.
With its massive implication to Idaho’s economy and way of life, I am delighted to be chosen as a member of the @NatResources Committee. This assignment gives #ID01 a voice to encourage more local flexibility and authority over resource management practices.
A very special visitor Miss Paoline Hsue and her mother stopped by my office to deliver a thank you card unlike any I have received. It was an honor to help locate a #ProLife clinic next door to planned parenthood in Boise to help mothers like yours choose life.
Very proud to give my first speech on the House floor on an issue I care about deeply. #ProLife
