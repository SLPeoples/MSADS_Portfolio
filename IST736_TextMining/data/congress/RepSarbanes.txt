Instead of misusing taxpayer dollars to try to deliver on a fanciful and far-fetched campaign promise, President @realDonaldTrump should be directing his Administration to tackle the real problems that our country faces.
We also shouldn’t waste another second without reorienting our national priorities to mitigate climate change — which will devastate our nation’s coastline, weaken our economy and threaten our national security.
Every single day, millions of families across the country struggle to find affordable addiction treatment for loved ones suffering from the opioid crisis. We should be focusing our national efforts and resources on saving lives and ending this terrible epidemic.
For the record, there is no national security crisis at our southern border. The President’s rash decision to declare a #FakeNationalEmergency is an affront to the real challenges that our nation faces — like climate change and the opioid

Here’s why wealthy and well-connected special interests and their Republican allies in Congress oppose #HR1 #ForThePeople.
��� Mitch McConnell (@senatemajldr) is absolutely terrified of #HR1 because it would end the pay-to-play influence peddling system in Washington that he helped build. In fact, he’s so worried about it that he went to the Senate floor – again – to panic about the bill.
Why are the billionaires, the corporations and the super PACs so terrified about #HR1? Because it rebalances power in Washington, taking it away from these special interests and giving it back to the people. #ForThePeople
These wealthy and well-connected special interests are telling Members of Congress, “You better not vote for #HR1 – or else….”
No surprises here. The billionaire Koch Brothers are leaning on Congressional Republicans to oppose #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.
Here’s an inside look at how billionaires call the shots in Washington.
As the great Fannie Lou Hamer once said, “The American people are sick and tired of being sick and tired.” It’s time to give the American people their voice back, end the #CultureOfCorruption in Washington and return to government #ForThePeople. #HR1

We can invest in high-quality education and housing for every American family. #HR1 #ForThePeople
We can take swift and meaningful action on climate change and protect America’s environmental treasures – like the Chesapeake Bay. #HR1 #ForThePeople
We can have commonsense gun safety in America, save thousands of lives and stop the @NRA. #HR1 #ForThePeople
We can lower prescription drug prices, decrease insurance premiums and make it easier for everyone to get high-quality and affordable health care. #HR1 #ForThePeople
We can have an economy that lifts up middle-class families, raises wages and offers good-paying jobs – not give trillions of dollars in tax cuts and giveaways to millionaires, billionaires and corporations. #HR1 #ForThePeople
And when Members of Congress pay attention to the small donors – to the everyday people – we can bring about the change that Americans across the country want to see.
With more millennial candidates able to run and win on small donations – without having to rely on wealthy donors, PACs or corporations – our representatives in Washington will put people’s interests ahead of special interests. #HR 1 #ForThePeople
Backed by an energized and inspiring group of millennial Members of Congress like @RepKatieHill, @HouseDemocrats will pass #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act, which will create a brand new, 21st-century campaign finance system that multiplies the power of small donors.

The #TrumpShutdown is an affront to our country’s civil servants and a point of national shame.
The #TrumpShutdown will also send 400,000 federal employees home without the benefits and compensation they deserve.
The #TrumpShutdown – a temper tantrum he’s throwing over a wildly unpopular border wall – will actually harm the men and women who put their lives on the line to secure our border, forcing about 54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents and customs officers to work without pay.
President @realDonaldTrump’s shutdown will cause unnecessary chaos, instability and economic harm to our country, and force more than 420,000 federal employees to work through the holidays without pay.
