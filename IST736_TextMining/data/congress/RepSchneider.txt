Finally. I proudly voted today to end Congress’s shameful inaction on gun violence by passing #HR8 a bipartisan bill requiring background checks on all gun sales. With commonsense steps like these to prevent future tragedies, we can honor those we’ve lost. #EnoughIsEnough
This is double taxation and it’s wrong. The SALT restriction was included to put the burden of the new tax law on districts and states like ours. Repealing this unfair measure is a top priority.
China's unfair trade actions have hurt American businesses, and they deserve to be held to account. But sparking a trade war can't be the answer. I've heard from #IL10 businesses struggling with tariff-based cost increases. Lots to discuss today with @USTradeRep Lighthizer.
This moment is about far more than partisan politics or the merits of a border wall. I hope Senators of both parties will follow suit by putting the good of our county first and voting to defend the Constitution.
I joined a bipartisan majority in the House to vote to reassert our Article I congressional authority and restore the rule of law by terminating the President’s self-serving emergency declaration.
Supreme Court's decision 5 years ago to gut the #VotingRightsAct is one of most damaging rulings in recent memory. Fighting for voting rights remains as urgent as ever. I'm proud to help introduce Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore these vital protections. #RestoreTheVote

The extremist beliefs of the Otzma Yehudit party are odious and stand in direct opposition to the values on which Israel was founded. This party and its racism should be roundly rejected by all.
This unacceptable new rule censors the medical advice that doctors can share with their patients. More than 40 percent of patients in Illinois using #TitleX providers are served by Planned Parenthood. Their health care is directly jeopardized by this decision.
Continued our New Congress Listening Tour with a roundtable focused on immigration in Waukegan.
Last summer I challenged our elementary students to read 10 books before the end of the year, and more than 300 did so! We held an event at Andrew Cooke Elementary last night in Waukegan to celebrate their achievement. Loved hearing about their favorite books. #BradsBookworms
Our communities deserve assurances that the air we breathe is safe. We need ambient air monitoring of ethylene oxide at the two facilities in Lake County, and we need it now. Further delay from the EPA is unacceptable.
This is a moment that transcends our partisan politics. I hope all my colleagues will join this resolution to defend our Constitution and end President Trump's egregious executive overreach.
On Day 2 of our New Congress Listening Tour, I stopped by @OaktonCollege for a conversation about health care. Lowering the cost of health care and improving patient access is consistently one of the top issues I hear from constituents across our district.
Discussing protecting Medicare and Social Security with seniors at Oak Hill Supportive Living in Round Lake as part of our New Congress Listening Tour.
Great turnout for our first stop of the New Congress Listening Tour on climate change and the environment in Fox Lake! Looking forward to continuing the conversation on health care tomorrow in Des Plaines.
Yesterday I stopped in at open houses at the offices of State Rep. Jonathan Carroll and State Representative Daniel Didech. It was good to catch up and I look forward to continuing to work in partnership with our state reps.
We have a responsibility to act on commonsense reforms to our gun laws so more families don’t face this same tragedy. #EnoughisEnough
I am heartbroken that another community so close to our home has been shattered by senseless gun violence. I am grateful for the quick and selfless actions of our first responders, including those who were injured in the line of duty.
Regardless individual opinions on the wall, this is a moment that transcends partisan politics. I fully support the legislative and judicial effort to counter this egregious executive overreach, and urge my colleagues of all political stripes to join defense of Constitution.
President Trump’s national emergency declaration blatantly disregards our Constitution. If unchecked, it will do great damage to our long-standing system of checks and balances.
Economic development is a top priority in our region, but it does not have to come at the cost of environmental degradation.
Any potential flooding impact of the #Foxconn development on our downstream communities needs to be studied. I'm urging new WI Gov. Tony Evers to re-examine the environmental reviews of the project that his predecessor, Gov. Scott Walker, had waived.
Contrary to the President’s fear-mongering, I remain confident we can successfully work to secure our border and reform our broken immigration system if we commit to work together across the political divide.
This would blatantly disregard our constitutional system of checks and balances, and set a dangerous precedent. I am committed to working with my colleagues in Congress to counter the President’s overreach if he chooses this route.
I’m glad Congress is acting to fund the government and that President Trump will not impose another needless shutdown. But I’m deeply concerned by reports the President plans to declare a national emergency to build his ill-conceived border wall.

If you're a veteran who needs assistance, our office is here to help at (847) 383-4870. In last year, we've worked with area veterans to expedite medical appointments, process benefit claims with the VA, secure medals and honors that were earned but never received, and more
The men and women who nobly served our nation deserve to hear thank you throughout the year, not just on Veterans Day. Over the weekend, I distributed #ValentinesforVeterans made by students and constituents to local veterans in North Chicago and Antioch.
Our legislation would require the EPA to immediately update its EtO emission standards based on the science, as well as act transparently so affected communities have the most up to date information on any risks. This is about our public health, and delay is unacceptable,
The EPA needs to urgently take all necessary and appropriate steps to protect our communities from the risks of exposure to ethylene oxide – a known carcinogen.
The death of a child is a loss like no other, but current laws leave no time for parents to grieve and begin to recover before returning to work. I'm leading legislation that would expand the Family Medical Leave Act #FMLA to support parents in the toughest time imaginable.
I was glad to speak with the Jewish Council for Public Affairs during their visit to Capitol Hill today as they celebrate 75 years of service in communities around the nation @theJCPA
Happy Birthday to Illinois’ very own, President Abraham Lincoln! Today he is celebrating his 209th birthday!
The truth is the long standing, bipartisan support in Congress for the U.S. - Israel relationship is based on a bedrock of mutual strategic interest and shared democratic values.
Claiming that U.S. support for Israel is a function of political donations rings of classic and abhorrent anti-Semitism. And it could not be more wrong.

I introduced legislation with @RepChrisSmith that would require the Special Envoy position be filled and also elevated to the rank of ambassador. It passed the House overwhelmingly in January - a sign of Congress's strong bipartisan commitment to fighting anti-Semitism and hate.
It's good news that President Trump has finally filled the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism position after two years. At a time of dangerous anti-Semitism rising at home and around the world, this vital position cannot sit vacant.

It’s been 10 years since the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act became law – but our work isn’t done. I'm proud to help reintroduce the #PaycheckFairness Act today to help close the gender pay gap and strengthen protections in the 1963 #EqualPay Act.
It’s a cold night back home but more than 4,900 constituents listened in to our telephone town hall tonight. Good discussion on everything from shutdown to healthcare to education and climate change.
I’m at our first hearing of new Congress for @WaysMeansCmte, which is focused on protections for 130m Americans with pre-existing conditions. I’m glad that preventing sabotage of the #ACA and defending these life-saving protections will be a priority this Congress.
We and our future generations must continue to study and learn from history, and take concrete action to make “Never Again” more than just words.
On #InternationalHolocaustRemembranceDay, we remember the millions of people, including six million Jews, murdered by the Nazi regime. We remember so the world never forgets the evils unleashed by anti-Semitism and hatred, and to remain steadfast against these threats.
Thank you @MomsDemand for coming by the office today. I was proud to co-sponsor H.R 8, bipartisan legislation to close loopholes in our background check system, earlier this month. After years of inaction, we have to act on gun safety in this Congress.
It's a shame so many had to needlessly suffer without paychecks for Pres. Trump to come to come to this realization. The men women of the Coast Guard, TSA, FAA, CBP, FBI, other agencies who continued to do their duty and work unpaid on our behalf deserve our gratitude.
As I have said from day one, the path out of this shutdown is straightforward: re-open the government, pay our federal workers, and then we can have an honest, open debate about the best way to secure our border without using the livelihoods of thousands of families for leverage.
After 35 long days, I am relieved that common sense has finally prevailed and President Trump has agreed to end his unnecessary and damaging government shutdown. #EndTheShutdown
After President Trump withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement, I led a resolution condemning the decision and praising the states and cities that stepped forward to maintain carbon reduction commitments. I'm glad that Illinois is now among group committed to #ActOnClimate

Disappointed #SCOTUS is allowing Pres. Trump's transgender military ban to take effect. Any capable individual who volunteers to wear the uniform deserves our gratitude, not our prejudice. Need to redouble our legislative efforts to reverse discriminatory ban #ProtectTransTroops
Glad to talk with constituents who dropped by our #NeighborhoodOfficeHours this morning in Wheeling. Heard a lot of concern about the effects of President Trump’s shutdown. I agree it’s time to stop using federal workers as political pawns and re-open our government.
While we have made significant progress, much work remains to realize Dr. King’s vision. I am looking forward to spending this Day of Service with individuals following in his footsteps and working to make change in our community. #MLKDayOfService
Today our country honors the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as the legacy of all those who struggled during the Civil Rights Movement to end racial segregation and discrimination, and build a more just and equal nation. #MLKDay
President Trump should take yes for an answer and accept the bipartisan legislation the House has passed to re-open our government. Then, when our government is re-opened, we can have an honest, open debate about the best way to secure our border.
Some are struggling to make ends meet. These are the men and women who help keep our food and flights safe, environment healthy, financial markets fair, and borders secure. They are our neighbors, not pawns for the President’s political battles.
Today, I met with local federal workers and their families who are bearing the brunt of President Trump’s decision to shut down our government, including employees at the FAA, EPA, SEC, and CPB who are working without pay or furloughed. #EndTheShutdown
I am proud to introduce this legislation with support from both sides of the aisle w/ @RepKenMarchant @RepTerriSewell and @RepJasonSmith during January, National Slavery Human Trafficking Prevention Month
Survivors of human trafficking need our support as they rebuild their lives. Our bill would ensure restitution payments to victims of this heinous crime are not subject to federal income tax, ending discrepancy that treats criminal civil payments to survivors differently.
Read my letter to the editor in today's Daily Herald on why we need to #EndtheShutdown.

I’m inspired by the student survivors of the Parkland shooting that have been such strong advocates for change. Earlier this month, I was proud to  co-sponsor universal background check legislation. This will be the Congress we finally act on gun safety.
It’s been 9+ yrs since Congress last raised minimum wage to $7.25. That's too long. I support #RaiseTheWage Act to gradually increase min. wage to $15 by 2024. Putting money in the pockets of hardworking Americans is good for workers, good for businesses, good for the economy.

Her story is not unique: there are more than 800,000 federal employees, the people who work on our behalf, in similar situations. My message to the President: stop holding these workers hostage and re-open the government. #EndtheShutdown

RT @WaysMeansCmte: #PresidentTrump: who’s going to pay for the wall?? Answer: hurricane victims, apparently.
Today, I introduced legislation with @RepCasten to make sure that senior staff are not rewarded with raises while the Administration’s inaction perpetuates a shutdown that keeps hard-working federal employees without pay.
Federal workers are already bearing the brunt of President Trump’s shutdown. Doling out raises to political appointees in the Administration while working families go without pay just adds insult to injury.
Today thousands are missing a paycheck because Pres. Trump refuses to re-open the gov't. I’ve committed to return my pay until to the Treasury until the shutdown is over. I can't in good conscience accept pay while so many hardworking federal employees are forced to go without.
I am proud the House passed our bill overwhelmingly today to fill the vacant Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism position. I hope the Senate will follow our lead and the President will take note of the strong bipartisan action and fill this long overdue vacancy.

Thank you #IL10! Representing you is the highest honor of my life, and I’m ready to hit the ground running to make progress for our communities.
We need to strengthen the firewall between public service and corporate lobbying to ensure public servants are putting the needs of the people first and not the industries they regulate.

In a year when so many brave voices have come forward, we need to reauthorize #VAWA immediately to protect needed resources to survivors of domestic violence sexual assault.

The American people deserve better. President Trump is once again putting politics ahead of the public good and hurting working families with his decision to shut down our government.
I’m grateful for Secretary Mattis’s service and steady hand at the Department of Defense. For our country’s sake, the Senate must only approve a new Secretary similarly committed to maintaining our leadership abroad and standing up to the President when he’s wrong.
We all share the desire to fully defeat ISIS, end the civil war in Syria, and thwart Iran’s nefarious influence. Unfortunately, the President’s approach will more likely push each of these objectives further out of reach.
I am profoundly concerned by President Trump’s abrupt announcement of a withdrawal of all American forces from Syria—it is premature and leaves our objectives in the region dangerously incomplete.
I dropped by the Glenbrook North HS Winter Showcase this afternoon. Great artwork by the students!
The Admin has an obligation to end the sabotage and instead defend the law.  More importantly, I encourage Pres. to work w/ incoming Democratic majority to develop health care solutions that lower cost, improve care, and expand coverage to more Americans.
But the law remains under assault from an Administration willing to remove protections for people with pre-existing conditions, promote inadequate and incomplete insurance plans, and slash funding for open enrollment advertising and assistance.
