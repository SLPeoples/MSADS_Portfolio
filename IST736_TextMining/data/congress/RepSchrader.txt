I am proud we passed my Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act today to designate a 21-mile stretch of the Molalla River as “recreational” under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System to preserve the beauty, history, and ecosystem of the river for generations come.
The President's national emergency declaration is inaccurate, irresponsible, and unconstitutional!
Thank you to the teachers of Wood Middle School in Wilsonville for inviting me to come speak with their 8th graders. I’m always happy to talk with students about being a Member of Congress, and to hopefully inspire a new generation of leaders!
From holding concerts that raise money for the worldwide eradication of polio to offering scholarships for local high schoolers, the Rotary Club of Wilsonville is dedicated to serving the community. Thank you for having me to speak with you, keep up the good work!
I’m always happy to be back home in Clackamas County talking with folks about what issues are impacting them the most. I appreciate everyone who took the time to join me today for a town hall, and I thank you all for your questions and comments.
There is a lot happening on the Willamette River, and it is important that stakeholders know how they may be affected as federal agencies begin a re-evaluation of how USACE operations on the Willamette River impact chinook and steelhead populations.

There are a lot of great things happening over in Lake Oswego. I had a great time touring around the area and talking to folks at Rebound, Tavern on Kruse, and Brave Collective in Kruse Village!
When some students at Queen of Peace in Salem wrote to me to tell me what they like about Salem and what they would do to improve it, I decided to visit them and their classmates to hear their ideas in person. It’s great to meet students who care so much about our community.
I want to thank all the local leaders from Marion and Polk counties for joining me to talk about the needs of their communities. From farming, to owning a small business, to the need for housing, hearing from you about these issues helps me better serve you in Congress.
Thank you to everyone in the Salem area who joined me for a town hall this evening. There’s no better way to kick off a new Congress than meeting directly with constituents to talk about what’s at the top of folks’ minds and how I can best serve them in Congress.
In the Mid-Willamette Valley, @SEDCOR works to promote good jobs and strong communities. As a farmer myself, I was happy to join more than 200 guests today to talk about local agriculture. Thanks for having me!
POTUS has gone too far. Our founders gave the Legislative Branch, not POTUS, the express power to decide how to spend taxpayer $$. The POTUS’s job is to execute the will of Congress his action today is an infringement on the power delegated under Article 1 of the Constitution.
I've visited the US-Mexico border there is no national emergency. Families children seeking asylum from brutality in their home countries hold no threat. Yesterday, Congress passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan agreement on how to fund security along our southern border.
As a result of the testimony and outreach by the students of MSD High School in Parkland and students in my own district, I am cosponsoring HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act to require universal background checks on all firearm sales, like we have in Oregon.
Parents should be able to take their children to school each day knowing they will come home safely that night. My thoughts today are with the families of the 17 students who did not return home a year ago today.
I introduced the Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act this week to preserve the beauty, history, ecosystem of our Molalla River while also providing badly-needed economic benefits to our region through increased tourism recreational opportunities.
I am proud to support the bipartisan H.Res. 119, a resolution recognizing February as National CTE Month. CTE aligns learning opportunities with in demand jobs to give the next generation the skills they need to compete in the global economy.


I am hopeful this will be the Congress we will be able to finally codify important #NetNeutrality protections for consumers.
Held a hearing this week in @EnergyCommerce on strengthening our health care system the decision in Texas v. US. The goal is to provide better health care and w/o ACA’s vital consumer protections, Americans could face skyrocketing premiums out of pocket costs #ProtectOurCare
Today, I visited with @TSA workers @NACTA members at @flypdx who have spent the last 35 days working without pay to keep airports safe and running. Happy that the government will be reopening and 9,600 of Oregon's hardworking federal employees will be receiving paychecks again.
Today I sat down with local leaders in Clackamas County to talk about what’s happening in DC and how I can support their efforts at home. Thank you for everyone who came, and for sharing your stories about how the shutdown is affecting you and our community.
Roughly 9,600 federal employees in Oregon are being impacted by the current shutdown. I called on @USDOL to make clear that federal employees deemed “essential” - those working without pay - may be eligible for unemployment insurance.
The first bill I introduced this Congress was my Hold Congress Accountable Act because in any other profession in this country, if you don’t do your job, you don’t get paid. Congress should be NO different.
ICYMI: I joined @KATUNews this week to talk about my bill to reduce pay for Members of Congress during shutdowns. In any other profession, if you don't do your job, you don't get paid. Congress shouldn't be any different!
I want to convey my deepest condolences to the crew of the Mary B II, their families, friends, and the whole community for their immense loss this week after the boat capsized crossing the Yaquina Bay Bar. And I want to thank the US Coast Guard for heroically assisting the boat.
Met with TSA workers at PDX who have been working since December without pay because of this totally unnecessary partial government shutdown. I want to thank every TSA worker for their hard work over the past few weeks. Congress needs to do its number one job and pass a budget.
Tune in to News Radio 1190 KEX at 12:30 while I speak to Mark Mason about what’s going on in Washington.
As my first act this Congress, I reintroduced a series of government reform bills to increase transparency accountability, give a voice back to the people. Our democracy relies on the power in the voice of the people depends on a Congress that works.
Great to see the new @TillamookCheese visitor center today. Thanks for showing me around, and congrats on the new facility!
You won’t believe the exceptional work done by Tillamook High School students on their annual Charity Drive. Last year, students raised more than $176k for Doernbecher Children's Hospital, student scholarships, and community grants. Keep up the great work!
Very pleased that my legislation to close a $1 billion dollar loophole in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program passed in the House this week.
Very pleased my Endangered Salmon Fisheries Predation Prevention Act to protect our iconic Oregon salmon that are struggling to survive along the Willamette Columbia Rivers passed out of Congress today is headed to the President’s desk to become law!
Open enrollment for health coverage in 2019 is short again this year: the deadline to #GetCovered is December 15th. Don’t miss your chance, head to  today!
Since OR's Global Warming Commission found last year that the bulk of carbon emissions in OR come from dead, diseased trees, it’s never been so clear that now is time for better forest management practices to reduce harmful emissions curb the threat that future fires may pose.
.@nytimes is right: not just a lack of management, but mismanagement of our forests are making them so ripe for devastating fires, like the ones our neighbors in California have had to endure this season.
Today, our country will come together to honor American servicemen and servicewomen for Veteran’s Day. We do not forget what our veterans sacrificed to protect our American values and our freedom. Thank you to all who have served, and happy Veterans Day!
Public libraries are one of the most important resources for a local community. That’s why I worked with the United States Library of Congress and its surplus book program to help add to Mt. Angel Public Library’s collection. Thanks for what you do for the people of Mt. Angel!
The Benedictine Brewery and Taproom in Mount Angel Abby is one of only three breweries in the nation owned and operated by monks. Even in Oregon, the beer capitol of the world (some would say), this is special. Thanks for showing me around.
As a veterinarian, I appreciate the work that Maria does at Silver Creek Lambscapes. However, new tariffs on meat products are hurting her business. It’s important to remember that when we talk about “trade wars,” it affects people in our own community.
Tune in now to @1190KEX while I speak to Mark Mason about what’s going on in Washington.
It is a great honor to welcome these brave men and women home from their recent deployment to the Middle East where they conducted over 80 medical evacuations. To the men and women of 3rd Platoon, G Company, 1-189 Aviation, welcome home!
Thanks to the Tillamook Habitat for Humanity for their dedication to the community. With perseverance and some outside-the-box thinking, they are helping families build homes they can afford.
Today, I joined fishermen in Newport to talk about this industry which they have built over generations to be one of the most successful and sustainable in the world. As fishermen continue to innovate their industry, it’s important the government keeps up to ensure their success.
It’s been more than two years in the making, but we finally cut the ribbon on the Highway 101 improvement project in downtown Tillamook! Tillamook is also the home of new businesses! Thank you to the Tillamook Chamber of Commerce for taking me around!
The Kiwanis Club of Tillamook exemplifies the power of community. Over their 50 years they have given back in so many ways, including raising and donating more than 450K to local students, helping more than 425 pursue dreams of higher education.
The City of Wheeler is angling to evolve our Oregon fisheries with the Community Supported Fisheries Program. With their new home in Wheeler, the group’s “boat to table” process offers higher quality products for locals and more equitable rates for fishermen.
Today, at the Pacific Technology Alliance roundtable on rural broadband access, we talked about what can be done to encourage rural connectivity and freedom of access so that no American is left behind in the 21st century economy because of where they live.
Walking through Independence with Mayor McArdle today it’s obvious that the city is taking big steps. It will be very exciting to see what new business, jobs, and visitors these developments along the waterfront bring to this small community.
Tune in to my interview on KPAM’s “The Afternoon Answer” today at
Today, I had the opportunity to talk with @ochspioneers AP History students about our political system and how they fit into it. Hearing from the next generation has always been a privilege in this job, and it's critical that they know the vital role their voice plays.
Thank you to the student at St. Paul High School who invited me to come speak in front of you and your classmates. Your voices are so important to the political process, it was a pleasure speaking with you today about what’s really going on how you can get involved.
Tune in to @1190KEX at Noon while I speak to Mark Mason about what’s going on in Washington.
@baumanfarms is one of the most popular farms in the Willamette Valley. Offering corn mazes, hay castles, zip lines and more, they host more than 100k people a year! Thanks to the Bauman family today for having me.
Successful business and industry in the Portland Metro Area is no coincidence, it is the result of work done by organizations like the @WestsideWEA. It was a pleasure to join @RepBonamici today to speak about our work in Congress.
Congratulations to @IEPDX in Wilsonville on their ribbon cutting today! It’s always a pleasure to see new businesses in our communities. Thank you to the Wilsonville Area Chamber of Commerce for organizing this “After Hours” event to celebrate last night.
Shadowing Valor Middle School Principal Jeff Taylor today it’s clear how much he cares for the school and the kids who attend it. Thanks for the work that you do, and for talking to me about how I can best support that work in Congress.
Starting a small business can be an overwhelming task. Groups like the Happy Valley Business Alliance help to make it more accessible by creating a community and a resource for those looking to start, or grow, their business. Thanks for having me today.
It was a pleasure speaking with the Keizer Rotarians. This group raises tens of thousands of dollars for the community each year with their events - thanks for the work that you do!
As Oregon’s cannabis industry continues to grow, it’s important that consumers know exactly what they’re getting. That’s where labs like @ChemHistoryLabs come in, which test to make sure that products are free of harmful chemicals so consumers can make safe, informed choices.
Folks from the @WestLinnRotary are always giving back to their community whether it’s planting trees at Willamette Park or opening their home to an exchange student. Thanks for your service, and for having me to talk about how I can best serve you in Congress.
Representing more than 200 Willamette Valley Family Farms, odds are your fresh Oregon produce comes from @NORPAC18. This farmer-owned cooperative supports Oregon’s iconic agricultural industry, which brings jobs to Oregon and grows healthy produce for the world.
During National Principal Month, I've been visiting principals at their schools to talk about what they are doing to lift up their schools, and what I can do to support that work. Thanks to Principal O’Neill for the work she does for her school, her teachers, and her students.
Oregon City is undergoing a transformation, and I appreciated the opportunity to meet with many of the business owners who are doing that work today at “Good Morning Oregon City.” Big thanks to the @oc_chamber of Commerce and @CitizensBank for hosting.
For more than three decades, @BobsRedMill grains have been a staple for many Oregonians. While their stone milling technique remains largely unchanged since Roman times, Bob has never stopped innovating his business which now rests with the Mill’s 650 employee-owners!
Congrats to @ClackCollege for opening Barlow Hall, their new Industrial Technology Center. Oregon’s economy is changing, and I applaud the college for making sure that our students are ready for it.
Did you know that it’s National Principals Month? Thanks to Lake Oswego High’s Principal Dickinson for showing me how you are working to ensure that our students are successful, and for giving me a positive reason to visit the principal’s office!
With a little help from the @FTA_DOT, the Salem Area Mass Transit District is modernizing its fleet of “@Cherriots” with new, clean-burning compressed natural gas busses.
Pleased to meet with @ailaoregon yesterday to talk about this Administration’s abhorrent immigration policy and what we can do in Congress to forge a new system that is strong, fair, and returns this country to the American ideals of respect and inclusion.

Congratulations to Ralph, Milo, and Ruby Sue on winning this year's Cutest Pets on Capitol Hill. If there's one thing we can always agree on here in Congress, it's a shared love for our four footed friends!
We’ve got a competition brewing at @AnheuserBusch’s #BrewDemocracy! Text SCHRADER to 202-883-6007 to vote for Heavenly Haze brewed this summer @10BarrelBrewing in Portland with snow from Mt. Hood, pine needles from some OR Christmas trees water from the well at Mt. Angel Abbey
Proud to join other Oregon coast legislators today at #OCCES to talk about how we can ensure that our coastal communities have the resources and tools they need to be strong and resilient.
It’s not right that the DoD is withholding veteran retirement benefits for some who were involuntarily called back to service. Although my bill to fix this was pulled, I will continue to fight for our veterans, like Alan, who deserve their retirements.
Between their work raising money for local high school scholarships and volunteering on projects throughout the community, it’s hard to know how these Milwaukie Rotarians find the time. Thanks for talking with me today, and for the work you do for this community.
TMK Creamery’s philosophy is, “it all starts on the farm.” As a farmer, I couldn’t agree more.  This family owned, Canby dairy does it all from growing the grain to packaging the cheese. Thanks for having me today!
Great to see the new Hazelnut Growers of Oregon facility ready to process the next batch of Oregon hazelnuts! Our state nut is really living up to its title.
With events like their lobster feed, which raises an incredible amount of money for charity, there is no denying that the Lake Oswego Rotary is a prime example of their motto, “Service Over Self.” Thank you for inviting me to speak with you today, it has been a pleasure.
We need changes to House rules like the proposal my bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus issued earlier this summer to give rank-and-file Members more power and control so the American people are actually represented. Read them here:
As we approach leadership elections in the House, my support for our next Speaker will only go to someone who will put their focus on breaking the gridlock in Congress and working on solutions – whichever side of the aisle they come from – to the problems our country faces.
Great day on the Molalla River with the Molalla River Alliance, @americanrivers @nfswildfish @TroutUnlimited @NWSteelheaders. Since I started in Congress, I have introduced the Molalla River Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to preserve the history and ecosystem of this magical place!
Having the @mentor_graphics worldwide headquarters here in Wilsonville means a lot of jobs for Oregonians. I was happy to see this facility today with so many local folks working in this high-tech industry providing software solutions to businesses around the globe.
Thanks to Clackamas County for working towards their goal to end veteran homelessness. The Veteran’s Village is an innovative approach to provide transitional shelter and services to our veterans in need.
I always enjoy catching up with the Oregon City Rotarians. What a great group of civically minded people who work hard to give back to their community.
The number of homeless veterans on our streets is unacceptable. The work of the Salem @WestCare Veterans Homeless Shelter is absolutely critical to our community. Thank you for your work to help change the lives of those who dedicated their own to this country.
Amazing to see the work that Recology Organics is doing to move us toward a zero-waste future. With new technologies to create compost from household waste, they are helping to make Oregon’s signature crops even more sustainable!
Pleased a bipartisan bill to strengthen our career and technical education programs that I cosponsored passed unanimously in the House today.
(2/2) persecute families seeking asylum without due process. We have totally vacant leadership in Congress. Instead of taking impulsive and ridiculous, exploitative votes, we should do our job and take real bipartisan, thoughtful action on immigration.
The men and women who work for ICE are not the problem and focusing in harping on the people who work at an agency is nothing more than a political stunt. There are real problems that need to be addressed like the horrendous policies by this administration that separate (1/2)
I want to thank all the folks at @TheSpringsLvng for your time and your thoughtful questions. It was a pleasure to speak with you, and an honor to serve you in the United States Congress.
Back in the day I was a small business owner in Canby, myself. It’s always to pleasure speaking with local business owners at home, thank you to the Canby Chamber of Commerce for having me today.
Workers have a right to unionize in order to negotiate pay, benefits, and workplace protections and have been a leading driver in creating America’s middle class. #unionstrong
Very pleased to have had the support of so many of my colleagues in the House today to pass my Endangered Salmon Fisheries Predation Prevention Act to tackle the issue posed by sea lion predation in the PNW in a bipartisan, thoughtful way. #SaveOurSalmon
Today is the 3rd anniversary of marriage equality becoming law of the land but LGBTQ people are still at risk of being fired from their job or denied housing. This is unacceptable. The #EqualityAct would extend existing civil rights protections to LGBTQ people. #EqualityForward
Let’s make one thing clear: yesterday the President didn’t fix the immigration problem this House is not fixing the problem today.
I also joined my Oregon colleagues to demand AG Sessions immediately reverse the administration’s zero-tolerance policy that’s left asylum seekers dumped in federal prisons like the one in Sheridan. Read our letter here:
Today, I joined my @EnergyCommerce colleagues to demand a hearing into the child detention centers to get answers on family separation and the conditions at these centers. #KeepFamiliesTogether Read our letter here:
I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, along with more than 190 of my colleagues, to prohibit separating children from their parents at the border AND I've signed onto a resolution condemning this horrible policy.
Great talking with the folks at the Capital Manor today. Thanks to all of you who came to chat with me about the issues that you see in the country and what I can do to serve you in the United States Congress
Doing this doesn’t just go against every American value but every human value we hold. The President needs to end this horrific policy, which never should have been a policy to begin with, immediately!
There is absolutely no reason to separate families or take small children away from their parents at the border. This totally unnecessary and cruel action calls to mind horrible decisions from history and it disturbs me to my core.
I'll be hosting a telephone town hall this Wednesday at 6pm PDT. At the time of the town hall, we will give you a call at the phone number you provide. Follow this link to sign up:

Thanks to Woodburn Rotary for chatting with me today. Good to see everyone best of luck with this year’s Mud Sweat Beers fundraiser to support local families, the Boys Girls Club, park projects, dental clinics for uninsured kids, international medical programs and more
Rep. @alonsonhli_leon and I met with kids involved in the Migrant Education Program at Woodburn High, which gives students the flexibility and support they need to earn a good education. Thank you to these students for your hard work and advocacy, it’s an honor to represent you
Often misunderstood, Red Barn Hemp produces CBD hemp oil products to offer people a safe and healthy alternative for pain and anxiety relief that does not come with the “high” of recreational marijuana. Thanks for showing me more about the industry.
As the business community in Clackamas County continues to grow and diversify, it’s clear that the efforts of the Clackamas County Business Alliance are paying off. Thank you for having me today.
Stunning to see a sea lion take a bite out of a salmon at the Willamette Falls today. Thanks to ODFW for taking me down to where the sea lions come to prey on our endangered salmon runs. It’s important that Congress take action on this issue now to save these fish.
These Oak Gove 5th graders wrote to me to ask how they can work to build a stronger community together. Thank you for having me today, you all give me hope for our future.
Proud to join the student veterans at Western Oregon University tonight to celebrate the memories of our fallen servicemen and women, and to honor their sacrifice.
Great visiting with all the members of the Oregon City Business Alliance today. Business is booming in this small community, and I thank you for your efforts and for allowing me to speak with you today.
Congrats to the Lake Oswego High girls lacrosse team for taking home the state title! Way to go, we are proud of your hard work!
There are 24 sea lions at the base of Willamette Falls gorging on the salmon spring run right now. @MyODFW says there's a 90% chance the Willamette Winter Steelhead run will go extinct in the next few years if we don't act. We must pass my bill, HR 2083, now! #SaveOurSalmon
I signed the #QueenoftheHill discharge petition to allow a vote on a DACA solution. This Congress has dragged its feet long enough, let's get it together and vote on a #DreamActNow

Have you ever heard of an Elk Ranch? Well here in Molalla, Rosse Posse Acres is home to 70 head of elk (plus an assortment of pygmy goats, wallabies and other interesting critters). Thanks to the Rosses for showing me around.
Great to see the Brentwood Corp. Cabinet manufacturing plant in Molalla today. One of the most technologically advanced cabinet door manufacturers in the country, they produce hundreds of styles and sell to countries throughout the Pacific Rim!

The Land and Water Conservation fund is an essential tool for state and local governments to preserve their treasured landscapes. It’s critical that Congress come together to extend this bipartisan program before time runs out later this year.
Today I convened local officials and stakeholders to talk with US Army Corps leadership about the effects of @PortlandCorps proposed plans to improve fish passage at the Detroit Dam. Thank you to everyone who came, spoke up, and listened.
What a great day in the canyon to take a tour of the Detroit Dam. The US Army Corps works hard to manage this dam for the benefit of communities both up and down the river.
This week is #NationalParkWeek as Oregonians we love our national parks. The problem is, we love them too much the backlog of maintenance needs for our parks has climbed to a whopping $11.6 billion. Read my @CongMikeSimpson plan to restore our parks:
In celebration of Earth Day this week, I joined @WLWVdistrict students at CREST who are getting their hands dirty and learning to farm food for their own cafeterias
Proud to once again host my annual Fishermen's Roundtable in Newport.  Oregon Coast Fisheries are some of the most successful and sustainable in the world and it is critical that we convene industry professionals and policy makers to ensure it stays that way!
Unless Congress acts, we stand to lose so many talented young people from our workforce communities, which is why today, I joined more than 200 of my colleagues – Democrats Republicans – to introduce the “queen-of-the-hill” rule to allow a floor debate on 4 DACA solutions.
Since the fall, I’ve been sharing the stories of Oregonians who are also Dreamers on the House floor because right now hundreds of thousands of young folks throughout our communities are being recklessly kept in a limbo of uncertainty and fear. #DreamActNow

This is exactly why I’ve been working for years on solutions, like my bill HR 2083, to save our endangered salmon in the Columbia River system, or as @seattletimes calls it the “all-you-can-eat fish buffet for hungry sea
It's National #AgDay! Oregon is home to more than 34,000 farms, producing more than 200 types of crops. Today is a great opportunity to thank all of our farmers for producing the food and fiber our communities rely on every day. #CelebrateOregonAgriculture

.@SEDCOR works strategically to ensure that our Mid-Willamette Valley businesses are connected to the resources they need to create high-wage jobs for our community. Thank you for helping to drive our economy forward.

The administration’s proposal to open up our coasts to oil drilling could be devastating to our Oregon beaches and fishing industry. Retweet to #ProtectOurCoast.
Oregonians overwhelmingly support enforceable protections to ensure an open internet and so do I. That's why I'm a cosponsor of Rep. Doyle's CRA legislation to overturn the FCC's recent order to roll back net neutrality rules.
I've called for a 60-day extension to the public comment period on the administration's plans to roll back protections for our West Coast from offshore oil and gas exploration. I believe it's critical that everyone is given a voice on this. Read my letter:
Thanks to all the local leaders in Lincoln County who took the time to talk with me today about how the I can help support their efforts to create affordable housing, give their kids access to a strong education, and improve the local infrastructure.
Local leaders are working hard in Tillamook on issues like affordable housing, infrastructure repair, and emergency preparedness. Thanks to Port of Tillamook Bay’s Michele Bradley and Port of Garibaldi’s Val Folkema and the local leaders who came out to talk about how I can help.
I'm also a cosponsor of H.R.3947, the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act to ban bump stocks like those used in Las Vegas last year H.R.4240 to update the National Instant Background Check System, which could have prevented the horrific massacre in Sutherland Springs, TX.
There are common sense, bipartisan steps that we can take to curb prevent this from continuing to happen. We can start with background checks, holding hearings on gun violence, and conducting federal research into this epidemic.
It's been moving humbling this week to see the brave students from Parkland become so active, but the reality is that parents should be able to take their children to school each morning knowing that they will come home safely that night. This epidemic should not be happening.
Thanks to everyone who came to my Lincoln County Town Hall tonight. There is an incredible amount of engagement in this political moment, and together we can take that energy to Washington and make real changes for our communities.
On this day in 1859, Oregon became the 33rd state in the Union. More than 150 years later, we still boast some of the best natural beauty in the county. Happy Birthday to Oregon!
Oregon has a long tradition of dairy farming, and it was a pleasure to meet with the Oregon Dairy Farmers Assn to talk about their priorities for the upcoming Farm Bill. Working together, we can ensure that this industry is successful for generations to come.

There’s an incredible amount of activism happening in Tillamook County, and I appreciate all of you who took the time to join me at my town hall this weekend.
Thank you to all the students who came today to learn about the United States Service Academies and how they can attend them. It’s incredible to see the amount of young people who are driven to get an education in service of this country.
Town halls are the most effective way for me to talk directly with my constituents. Thanks to everyone in Clackamas County who showed up this morning to make your voices heard!
Today, I added my name to my colleague Rep. Doyle’s legislation (CRA) that would overturn the FCC’s recent order to roll back #NetNeutrality. As I’ve said, Oregonians overwhelmingly support enforceable protections to ensure an open internet and so do I.
