I opposed HR 1, inaccurately entitled “For the People,” because it undermines our fundamental 1st Amendment Rights, usurps the rights of state local governments, degrades the integrity of our elections– which, frankly, is the goal.

I took to the House floor to condemn FGM and call for international efforts to stop the horrific practice worldwide. FGM is an unconscionable, systematic form of abuse and subjugation perpetuated against the youngest and most vulnerable among us. #EndFGM
#EndFGM
We must strengthen our efforts to stop this practice; it must end immediately, those who perpetrate it must be brought to swift justice in the US. I ask the 22 States that currently have no law banning FGM -including my home state of PA- to pass legislation immediately. #EndFGM
I’ve introduced two pieces of legislation to help prevent the practice of FGM in the US. Please learn more by visiting the link below:  #EndFGM
FGM made headlines in the US. Drs. Fakhruddin Attar and Jumana Nagarwala are accused of performing FGM on at least 9 underage girls, from 8 to 13 years old. Most charges were dropped when the US federal ban was ruled unconstitutional. #EndFGM
RT @UNFPA_DC: Thank you @RepLoisFrankel and @RepScottPerry for your leadership to #EndFGM!
FGM is primarily concentrated in 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East, and Asia – most common in Somalia, Guinea and Djibouti, where more than 90% of women and girls ages 15 to 49 are mutilated on a routine basis. #EndFGM
FGM comprises all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. The @WHO says there are no medical benefits. The trauma lasts a lifetime. #EndFGM

FGM is a deeply rooted cultural practice, impacting more than 200 million girls worldwide. In 25 countries where it’s practiced, an estimated 68 million girls will be cut in the next 12 years. It’s most commonly performed on girls from infancy to age 15. #EndFGM

When we ask our Law Enforcement to undertake a mission, we need to ensure they have the resources to carry it out. When the Border Patrol Chief asks for a wall (or technology, fencing agents) we need to give it to her.

In April, the federal government took in a record tax haul, marking the biggest-ever monthly budget surplus on record - collected $515 billion and spent $297 billion, for a surplus of $218 billion - which means the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is working and the economy is booming.
