This is �% correct. The Dem majority was built by the 31 @HouseNewDems who turned red seats blue and will work together for progress. Also, the differences among Ds pale in comparison to the differences between Ds and Rs, who have abandoned the center.
It also standardizes disclosure laws to ensure 501(c)(3)s, labor organizations, and Super PACS follow the same rules—including disclosing donors who give $10,000+ per cycle. Companies with significant foreign control, ownership, or direction can't spend money in U.S. elections.
It includes the Honest Ads Act, a bill I cosponsored to require disclosure for online advertisements similar to television, radio, and satellite ads so the public knows who produced them. #ForthePeople

There's bipartisan agreement that we need to tackle rising healthcare costs. That's why @HouseNewDems will continue our work to stabilize and improve the individual marketplace. Americans sent us to D.C. to make health care more affordable. We're going to deliver on that promise.

My deepest condolences go out to the families of Brandon, Asher, David, and Kyle. Our hearts are with them during this tragic time. The loss of three San Diegans is a loss for our entire community.

@RepAngieCraig @EnergyCommerce Since day one, the Trump Administration has attacked Americans’ health care and increased out-of-pocket costs. @HouseDemocrats can undo the damage by strengthening programs that work-- like reinsurance--to bring down costs. #ProtectOurCare
I introduced the State Health Care Premium Reduction Act with @RepAngieCraig to provide federal funding for states to create reinsurance programs, which help lower the cost of health care premiums. Today, I shared our bill with the @EnergyCommerce Health Subcommittee.
Thanks Marlem and @illumina for your example and leadership. #CA52
To all those who have been hurt by gun violence, lost a loved one, or fought tirelessly with us: Today’s historic vote is for you. We won't stop fighting for commonsense gun safety reforms. #EndGunViolence
After too many instances of gun violence across the country, Americans raised their voices and demanded solutions. An overwhelming majority support commonsense universal background checks. That's why we need #HR8--an overdue step toward solving the gun violence epidemic.
Background checks work: Our current system has already stopped more than 3 million sales to convicted felons and other prohibited purchasers. Expanding the system to cover sales online and at gun shows--where a background check isn't required--will keep more Americans safe.
Today is a new day—the House just took real action to keep Americans safe by passing a bipartisan bill to expand background checks to all gun sales. #HR8
Real tax reform would promote American growth and competitiveness. Instead, the #GOPTaxScam chose a path that blows up the deficit and hurts working families in the long run. Despite what the Trump Administration claims, these tax cuts still don't pay for themselves.
Met with @e2org to discuss how investments in electric vehicles, the grid, and ARPA-E projects benefit both the environment and our economy.
Honored to join @HouseBudgetDems for my first hearing. I look forward to working toward a fiscally responsible path for Congress that makes the right investments in our country and economy.
Today, the House is taking a historic vote on #HR8, a bipartisan bill to expand background checks to all gun purchases. After years of inaction, today we offer a real solution. I'm proud to co-sponsor and vote for this bill to keep Americans safe. #EndGunViolence
Women should have access to comprehensive reproductive care and limiting information on their options effectively undermines that right. That's why I joined my colleagues to tell @SecAzar to withdraw this rule that undermines public health, especially for underserved populations.
Congress has to be a check on the president, who wants to take the money from important military construction projects to pay for his archaic wall. That's why I voted to block Trump's #FakeEmergency and this reckless use of executive

I joined @LeaderHoyer, @RepJuanVargas and @RepMikeLevin at San Ysidro Port of Entry for a tour and briefing with local @CBP leadership on changes to migrant processing procedures. Sending asylum seekers away before they’ve had the chance to be heard is wrong.

Happy #PresidentsDay. Today, we face a changing nation vastly different than the one of our forefather’s, but we can overcome these challenges just as Washington and Lincoln did. Together, we can advance the principles of freedom, truth, and opportunity for all Americans.
2 years ago, Trump defunded the EPA program that finances repairs to sewage infrastructure. Meanwhile, @RepJuanVargas, @RepSusanDavis and I fought to increase the program's funding in the spending bill. Trump's declaring a #FakeEmergency. We're solving a real one.
#ICYMI: Yesterday, we voted to fund the government though the rest of the fiscal year and avoid a shutdown. It also denied Trump's request to fund his wasteful wall. My full statement
Another senseless shooting this week. My heart breaks for the Aurora community, especially after San Diego experienced a similar incident this week. Gun violence is an epidemic and we will fight until we have sensible gun safety laws.
If the president declares an emergency every time he doesn’t get his way in spending bills, the budgeting power of Congress is eviscerated. This irresponsible, short-sighted, and reckless use of executive power is an affront to the Constitution. #FakeTrumpEmergency
Thank you to @SenFeinstein for leading this effort in the Senate, the Appropriators who helped secure the funding, and our local partners that provided valuable input. Our continued collaboration is essential to fixing the sewage crisis.
@RepJuanVargas @RepSusanDavis We will continue to provide input as the @EPA and the North American Development Bank determine how best to use the funding, communicating with San Diego stakeholders to determine our most pressing needs.
We secured $15 million to address the ongoing Tijuana River sewage spills in the spending bill that's now law. @RepJuanVargas, @RepSusanDavis, and I worked with our colleagues to advocate for this funding. Our joint
Immigrants define and enrich our communities in San Diego. They’re our teachers, service members, public servants, neighbors, and friends. Thank you to all of them for upholding our American values and being a part of our communities.
Today I spoke on the House Floor to honor Michael Monsoor, who set out to become a Navy SEAL against all odds and selflessly gave his life to save his team. Michael Monsoor never quit. It's only fitting he will be immortalized in San Diego's newest military vessel.
Today, I had the honor of serving as Speaker Pro Tempore. The new majority brings new ways to serve and I am grateful for the opportunity to preside over this morning's legislative business.
I'm deeply saddened by recent attacks on our San Diego communities. Instances of hate and violence in La Jolla, PB, and Hillcrest are horrifying. We can't allow hateful  political rhetoric to divide us. We must choose unity, civility, and respect.
We can solve problems through bipartisan debate, which has always been the key to lasting legislation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the negotiated spending resolution.Full statement by #NewDem

I’m relieved the Office of Refugee Resettlement has successfully reunited thousands of children with their parents, but there’s more work to be done. I urge the Trump Administration to prioritize reunification of any children still separated from their families.
The Trump Administration's failed family separation policy is cruel, immoral, and un-American. It is horrific to know that our government caused this pain and reuniting families is the least we can do. #KeepFamiliesTogether
