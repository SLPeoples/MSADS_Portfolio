Congressional oversight is important. There are several provisions in this that ensure there’s no executive overreach, including: 3-year sunset provision, require consultation w/ Congress 45 days prior to actions, publishing proposed actions for Public Comment.
The goal of this legislation is not to raise tariffs for their own sake. On the contrary, if @POTUS has the tools needed to bring other nations to the negotiating table, they will lower their tariffs on American goods.
Regarding the Reciprocal Trade Act, @WSJ ed board is wrong on this one. We’ve been losing a trade war for decades, and our workers, farmers, and manufacturers are hurting. It's time to level the playing field on trade. We cannot sit back and continue to be the world's piggy bank.
