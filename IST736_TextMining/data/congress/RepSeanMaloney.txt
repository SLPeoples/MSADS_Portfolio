I appreciate the fact that the EPA is finally getting in the game on cleanup criteria, but we need an enforceable drinking water standard to protect our communities right now. I’m going to continue watching this process like a hawk.
Dangerous people should not be allowed to have guns. That's not an extreme position. GOP will stonewall at the behest of their bosses at the NRA, but we'll still fight to protect our communities. Loopholes in #backgroundcheck laws make the system ineffective - time for reform.
