National election-security experts consistently point out New Jersey's election infrastructure vulnerabilities, and #HR1 gives our state access to grant money to improve and maintain those systems.
Voted in favor of HR 1, a landmark bill which will help strengthen our democracy. HR 1 addresses so many of the issues I was sent to Congress to tackle, from access to the ballot box, to improving the very machinery of our democracy.
The first responders who came from across the country, including Jersey firefighters I've spoken to, were exposed to toxic fumes in the aftermath of September 11th.I joined Democrats and Republicans last night to call on each and every member of Congress to #Renew911VCF.
“To let the fund go broke, or give another temporary extension and force our heroes and their families to worry about the rug being pulled out from under them in a few years, is unacceptable.”
I spoke to NJ firefighters Gerry and Mike about how they helped on the bucket brigades and bring equipment down to the pit. We are on the floor tonight to let them know we consider it our responsibility, our duty, to get this done.
I'm joining Democrats and Republicans down on the Floor tonight to call on Congress to pass the September 11th Victims Compensation Fund. Tune in to watch: #Renew911VCF

11 million Americans will feel the impact of the hastily written 2017 bill as they go to file their taxes. I’m working with members of our region to restore the full state and local tax deduction and end this double taxation of New Jerseyans.
NJ residents are bearing the brunt of the 2017 tax bill, but the state and local tax deduction cap isn’t just a Jersey problem.
Thank you to the Garden Club of Madison for coming to the office today to talk about how to protect our environment and promote conservation in NJ! ���
To the New Jerseyans who stood up after Parkland, and the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and asked me to go to Washington and help pass good gun safety legislation: Today I voted for #HR8, a bipartisan universal background check bill. Watch my floor speech below ️
Thanks for stopping by! Proud to support #HR8.
.@RepHoulahan and I are veterans. We are on the Floor this morning because we’re trained in firearms — and we know the importance of gun safety. It’s time to pass #HR8.
Heading down to the Floor to talk about why we need to pass #HR8 and join the 97% of Americans who support universal background checks. Tune in to to watch! �
As a veteran, I am concerned with the harm the unwarranted emergency declaration does to our military readiness and construction projects needed across the country and at Picatinny. I voted for the bipartisan resolution to keep military construction funds for military missions.
In Jersey, we know how important it is to protect our open spaces.In #NJ11, it's an issue that has brought us together.Glad to see the bipartisan #PublicLands bill shares that same kind of support. I'm voting yes so we can protect our lands and save taxpayers $9 million. 
Thank you to all the 9/11 first responders, survivors, and advocates who came to Capitol Hill yesterday to fight for a permanent September 11th Victim Compensation Fund. We are with you. #Renew911VCF
Our 9/11 heroes should have the peace of mind knowing that the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund can help them and their families — that's why I'm joining with my colleagues to co-sponsor a bill to make the fund permanent. #Renew911VCF

This is just the beginning. I hear from leaders across the country about how important it is that we get to work on improving our infrastructure, and spoke about this on the House Floor. ️
This bill directs Secretary Chao to make notice all grant funds for railroad repair in 30 days and award the grants within six months.
During the shutdown, I led a bipartisan group of 13 Representatives in a letter to @USDOT Secretary Chao asking her to adhere to the deadline for awarding $275 million already appropriated by Congress to fund urgent rail projects along the NEC.
The bill we passed last night secured funding for transportation projects that will help move NJ forward and get Americans to work:
This deal is just the starting point. With this agreement in place, we must turn to the hard work of building the 21st-century infrastructure New Jersey and the nation desperately needs. 4/
We’re also moving America forward by investing billions to fix our crumbling rails and roads, including $650 million for the Northeast Corridor, more than double the President’s initial plans. 3/

The shutdown should not delay the Gateway Project even further. After our rail tour this morning, I joined members of the NJ delegation urging @USDOT to move forward on the environmental review process.
Every delay, every deferred decision on the Gateway Project that puts politics over the people of this region is a danger to NJ commuters and to our economy. I will be talking what I saw back with me to Congress to continue to fight for the Gateway Project.
Currently, there’s only two hours of maintenance a night. Work crews have to bring in all equipment by train and turn off overhead wires. It’s just not enough time to maintain in place.
