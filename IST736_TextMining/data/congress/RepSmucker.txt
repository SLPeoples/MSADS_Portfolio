We saw what happens when agencies don't work together from the tragedies in Parkland and Aurora, Illinois. In some cases, the FBI has admitted it missed red flags and opportunities to intervene and stop shooters. This is why we need the #MassViolencePreventionAct.
We need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals wrongdoers. That's why I'm sponsoring the #MassViolencePreventionAct.This bill makes sure our law enforcement agencies are sharing important information with each other so they can act keep us safe.
I voted YES for this Motion which would require ICE is notified when an illegal immigrant tries to buy a gun through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.Someone in our country illegally is telling our government they're here. ICE should know about it.
Most criminals show signs they're violent or disturbed. The problem is most law enforcement agencies ignore them.We saw it in Parkland. We saw it again in Aurora, Illinois. I'm sponsoring a bill to help fix these problems and address them head on. Look for info later today.
#HR8 is not gun control. It's an attempt to criminalize law-abiding citizens.
Let’s say you plan a hunting trip with your friend but at the last minute your friend gets sick and can’t go. You ask to borrow your friend’s rifle. They lend it to you for the weekend. Under #HR8, doing something like that could lead to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.

“The Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts says that diverting certain nonviolent criminals has been shown to reduce the number of repeat offenders, cut jail costs, improve lives and strengthen families.”
It will be important that Congress continues to monitor and review the president’s role in this process to ensure the actions taken are within constitutional and statutory authority.
Emergency declarations do not allow the President to circumvent the Constitution. President Trump’s exercise of national emergency powers is limited. He is not creating a new law or allocating additional funding. He is re-appropriating money already set aside for other projects.
It’s Congress’ duty to ensure the President is acting within his constitutional authority to address that crisis. After research and consideration, I believe Trump is acting within his authority to take this action.
Emergency declarations should not be taken lightly. President Trump has made a strong case that there’s a humanitarian crisis at our southern border – and I agree.
We received 1,200 pages of this bill text a little after 1 a.m. That gave us less than 24 hours to read, review and vote on spending for a QUARTER of our government.This makes no sense. This process is broken. The American people deserve better.

Democrats have said they are willing to discuss our border security, including physical barriers – that’s a promising sign. I hope they make good on their word. We need to solve this problem because it’s our job. The American people are counting on us.
Over the next few weeks, we have a great opportunity to address border security. Walls work. They’re a critical part of the solution for our immigration problem. We need a wall to keep our borders safe and lessen the drugs flowing into our country over our Southern border.
I am glad the federal government is going to reopen and our 800,000 furloughed workers will be paid. As I’ve said before, shutting down our government isn’t an effective way to legislate.
Huge congrats to the @ManheimFFA on their Best in Show win at the #PAFarmShow!
Democrats' biggest talking point during this shutdown has been the 800,000 federal employees working without pay. Well, we've voted three times in a week to pay our federal workers. Guess who voted against that? Hint: They're all Democrats.
Make that not just once, not just twice, but now THREE times Democrats have voted against paying our furloughed workers.
Love this story of students celebrating #NationalSchoolChoiceWeek week in York County. Students and parents deserve to choose the best education setting to help children learn, grow and succeed.
I voted FOR this today because it pays furloughed federal workers currently affected by the shutdown. 215 Democrats disagreed. They voted against paying our federal workers — not just once but twice. They’re refusing to pay workers, putting them out of a 2nd paycheck on Friday.
Thanks to @LancasterOnline for this. I also hope other members — on both sides of the aisle — will support my bill to prevent government shutdowns.

Our partial shutdown can only end if we are willing to compromise. President Trump is showing again he’s willing to do so. He is being reasonable. He’s making an offer for the Dreamers who have been wrapped up in our country’s immigration problems by no fault of their own. (1/2)

House Republicans, along with President Trump, are committed to keeping America safe. The President has been clear: securing our border — which includes obtaining sufficient funding for the border wall — is a non-negotiable priority.
Republicans have made numerous commonsense, reasonable offers to Democrats which would have kept the government open and properly funded but Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would rather play partisan games and put politics ahead of national security.
Once again, Democrats are putting interests of illegal immigrants above interests of American citizens.
Hoping today brings peace, joy and happiness to you and your loved ones. #MerryChristmas!
