Now, I’m urging my colleagues in the Senate to support this commonsense and long overdue package of reforms—because the public interest should always take priority over the special interests.
I’m also proud to see my amendment included in the bill to push back on foreign interference in our elections and restore confidence in the integrity of voting infrastructure.
strengthening oversight of our campaign finance laws, and working to boost - not reduce - levels of direct participation in our democracy.
With this legislation, Congress is finally making substantial progress on stopping big contributors from hiding their political spending, keeping foreign dollars out of our elections,
Today is an historic day, and it marks a new era of elected officials actually following through on promises they made to the people they serve.
It is imperative that we, as members of Congress, work to restore the trust the American people have in our political process. In passing H.R. 1, the House has taken a major step that would change the way that Washington operates for the betterment of the public.
Proud to see my colleague @RepDebHaaland acting as chair on the U.S. House floor today, the first Native American woman to do so. #InternationalWomensDay

Too often before I arrived in Congress, I heard Central Virginians express doubt that their elected officials were truly working for them. I support #HR1, because I believe we should make it crystal clear that Congress serves the people, not an undisclosed list of big donors.
I had a great time today discussing the importance of NATO and the ins outs of our political system with @ChrisEvans. As someone who’s deeply passionate about public service to the American people, it’s not hard to pick a favorite hero in the Marvel universe…

A quick update from @RepHoulahan and I on the #cybersecurity measures we voted to pass this morning in the @HouseForeign Committee.
Early morning start with @RepHoulahan @RepSherrill. Just finished at #TheHillWomen116th panel, now back to Capitol Hill for a full day considering amendments to #HR1. As we tackle the issues that matter most to Central Virginians, I’m grateful to have colleagues like these two.

#ICYMI Watch my full remarks today on H.R. 1. This bill is a bold step toward making our political process more transparent, and includes reforms to shed light on the money pouring into politics and to guard against interference by foreign entities.
Today, I was proud to support @RepTomSuozzi's bipartisan amendment to #HR1, requiring a report after each election to assess foreign financial influence. As a former intel officer, I'm very concerned with protecting our political process from bad actors who seek to undermine it.

By expanding access to affordable prescriptions preventative care, we can avoid the costly emergencies down the road that place a huge strain on healthcare providers, insurance companies, government services.
Today, I urged House Committee leaders to stabilize the #ACA build a real strategy for expanding healthcare coverage. Affordable healthcare is one of the best economic investments we can make as a country.
Thank you @WIIS_Global for hosting today's discussion on women in international security. As destabilizing trends around the globe create increased risk of violence loss of opportunity for women, we must ensure that women are also a part of the conversation for solutions.
The American people sent us to Washington to encourage job growth, lower the cost of healthcare, invest in our infrastructure. #HR1 clears out corruption restores integrity, so we can get to the real issues that matter to Americans.  @RepJeffries @RepJasonCrow

The priorities that matter most to Americans-tackling healthcare costs, reinforcing the integrity of our elections, cleaning up corruption in Washington-can’t wait. That’s why the U.S. House is proud to consider #HR1 on the floor this week.
Great meeting today with @nokidhungry. As a mother of 3, I know firsthand that children cannot focus do their best when they are hungry. School breakfast is a key piece of the equation when it comes to ensuring a healthy, well-educated next generation.
I’m proud to support #HR1, because Americans deserve to know what money is going into our political system. This bill is an important step toward protecting our elections, increasing political transparency, and making sure that people’s voices are heard.
I support the #VotingRightsAdvancementAct, because our right to vote is at the heart of our identity as Americans. We must never allow discrimination, corruption, or misapplications of the law to interfere with each Central Virginian’s right to a voice in their government.

1. Pursue effective denuclearization steps 2. Respect the expertise of our intelligence community, many of whom are lifelong public servants3. Hold #NorthKorea accountable for its atrocious human rights abuses
During my @houseforeign Asia, Pacific, Nonproliferation Subcommittee hearing on North Korea today, I urged the administration to:

Constitutionally, it is Congress that has the authority to appropriate money, and the President’s efforts to sidestep that authority and the checks and balances process that authority represents is deeply concerning. (4/4)
Additionally, the president’s unilateral action of declaring a national emergency actually jeopardizes our national security by pulling critical funding from our military. (3/4)
Notably, it comes after Congress successfully conducted bipartisan, bicameral negotiations that resulted in the passage of a bipartisan appropriations bill last night—legislation that funds the government and provides for border security investments. (2/4)
This emergency declaration is a reckless, knee-jerk decision that sets a troubling precedent, and this declaration fundamentally undermines the constitutional authority of Congress. (1/4)
Nice to see there’s no beef between you two.
Just got back from the House floor with @RepHoulahan, where we passed bipartisan, bicameral legislation to keep the government open and fund much-needed infrastructure improvements.

17- We must demonstrate a willingness to collaborate and compromise as we serve the people we were elected to represent.
16- We are indeed stronger as a country when Congress and the President work together to move us forward, and our challenges are simply too large to sit idle in our corners.
15- This commitment to bipartisan engagement includes pushing to prevent another senseless government shutdown. I support discussions about strengthening our security, but we can do so without shuttering the government and subjecting the federal workforce to additional pain.
14- We need to focus on substantive, evidence-based policy—not just rhetoric. During my first month in Congress, I’ve participated in bipartisan discussions on issues as vital as the security of our borders and ports of entry, including at the White House.
13-However in Central Virginia, I have heard from many farmers about the negative effects of the ongoing trade war. As we approach planting season, farmers desperately need certainty, I hope the administration will help provide the necessary assistance to sustain farm families.
12- As a member of the @HouseAgDems, I wanted to hear more from the President about his priorities for our rural communities. In his speech, the President did discuss ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China.
11- And as a member of the @HouseForeign Affairs Committee, I will continue to stress the vital work of the diplomatic and intelligence communities, because I am concerned about the President’s continued criticism of these dedicated public servants.
10- By championing strong global partnerships, we can continue to keep our communities safe.
9- President Trump also addressed our national security priorities. As a former CIA case officer, I will continue to support a robust national security strategy, and we need to make sure this strategy includes working with our allies to promote global stability.
8- While I agree with this priority, we must also protect reliable healthcare coverage for millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions.
7- The President also rightfully discussed the staggering costs of prescription drugs. We need to work together to reduce prices, because working families, the elderly, and the disabled should never have to choose between remaining healthy and putting food on the table.
6- Last week, I called on House leadership to prioritize infrastructure improvements, so we can repair roads and bridges, strengthen broadband internet access, and modernize transportation networks.
5- I agree that we must promote job growth and economic development by investing in infrastructure in Central Virginia and across the country.
4- Tonight, President Trump advocated for increased bipartisanship—and I hope he intends to follow through on this commitment with concrete actions. In his speech, the President spoke about the need to pursue a bold, bipartisan infrastructure package.
3- Instead, it has fostered distrust in our system of government—and the record-long government shutdown was a testament to Washington’s ineptitude. The people of #VA07 just want us to do our jobs.
2- For Central Virginians, this brand of politics has not contributed in any meaningful way to lowering healthcare costs, increasing economic opportunity, or supporting the next generation of workers.
1- My thoughts on tonight’s State of the Union:Across the country, Americans have witnessed the detrimental effects of hyper-partisanship.
My thoughts ahead of the #SOTU tonight ️ I hope to hear the President discuss improving our infrastructure (especially rural broadband access), lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and strengthening our national security.
Women belong in the House - working on national security issues. Proud to wear white to the #SOTU tonight in honor of women’s suffrage with @RepSlotkin, @RepSherrill, and @RepHoulahan.

1- Today marks the first day of #BlackHistoryMonth. African-Americans have made immeasurable contributions to the fabric of our communities across Central Virginia and the United States.

Yesterday, I met with leaders from the @NFB_voice to discuss strategies and legislation that would help blind vision impaired people thrive in sighted school and work settings.
Today, my team met with leaders from @MomsRising. Topics like food security across #VA07 and broadband access for rural students are key issues for me, and I welcome discussions that help us advance the economic health success of mothers and families.
The wage gap undermines the economic stability of families in Central Virginia and across the country. I’m proud to help reintroduce #PaycheckFairness legislation that would bring us one step closer to #EqualPay for all Americans in #VA07 and beyond.
