I'm proud to be a cosponsor of the Guarding Congressional Authority Act, which would restore congressional authority end the politicization of national emergencies. As a constitutional conservative, I believe strongly in our system of checks balances.
Part 2 ️
In today’s @HASCRepublicans briefing, I voiced my concern about the future of Afghanistan and their continuing talks with the Taliban that the democratically elected government is completely excluded from. Watch part 1 �️
ICYMI: on Tuesday, the House unanimously passed the Burn Pit Registry Enhancement Act. This bipartisan legislation is crucial to saving veterans' lives who are exposed to burn pits while deployed. I will continue to vote for veterans at every opportunity.
I met with Northern border patrol agents and their families from #NY21 this morning. I was proud to advocate for them through my efforts to end the government shutdown. These agents worked diligently through the shutdown, and I’ll keep fighting for them in Congress! @NTEUnews
I met with representatives of Kinney Drugs, which is HQ’d in #NY21, and Walgreens Pharmacists from Canton this afternoon. We had an important discussion about how to prevent opioid abuse in our community. As leaders, we must do everything in our power to stop opioid addiction.
I loved speaking with high school students from Colton Pierrepont Central about how I got to Congress, what my days look like, what we are working on in the House. The Close Up company is an excellent resource that gives thousands of students the opportunity to visit Congress!
Last week, I had a productive meeting with the @LakeGeorgeAssn to discuss protecting Lake George’s drinking water, Lake Champlain Basin Program grants, and my work on invasive species issues. Proud to advocate for #NY21 each and every day!
I met with a few #NY21 members of @JDRF this afternoon. Jill Folsom is a constituent from Plattsburgh who has made advocacy for type 1 diabetes her life’s work. Last year, I participated in the JDRF Walk for Diabetes, I’m looking forward to continuing my advocacy for research.
"We, as leaders in government and members of Congress, have the highest responsibility to set an example...We urge all of our colleagues to support H.Res. 72, remove Rep. Omar from the House Foreign Affairs Committee, reject anti-Semitic and anti-Israel hate once and for all."
Read my op-ed in @thehill with @RepLeeZeldin and @RepTedBudd: Rejecting anti-Semitic and anti-Israel hate in the US and around the world.
The @shmdnow is one of my favorite events to participate in each year. I’m so proud of these students for raising a record of $837,859 to help community members in need. Thanks to all of the teachers and volunteers who made it possible! ��
On Friday, I met with Lake George Mayor Blais — the second longest serving mayor in the country! We had a productive discussion on many issues affecting the Lake George community. I’m proud to partner with him in improving the lives of #NY21 constituents.
Proud to get results for #NY21: grants for the Lake George Association’s efforts to protect water quality . I was one of the leading voices advocating for this funding in the House Appropriations process.
Don’t miss this @WDTnews editorial: Putting the nation first: Stefanik votes to block Trump’s national emergency“She has shown the value of her leadership in Congress by acting in the nation’s best interest rather than merely toeing a party line.” #NY21
I am grateful to Mark Whitmore for coming to Washington to raise awareness on invasive species issues. In #NY21, it is particularly important that we defend the natural habitats that attract business and tourism to our region.
Great #NY21 visits today: first stop was to @NewWayLunch to celebrate their 100 year anniversary, second stop was a productive meeting with the @LakeGeorgeAssn!
Today marks the first day of #WomensHistoryMonth As we reflect on the women trailblazers before us, let's encourage all women that they can achieve anything they set their mind to -- through resiliency, strength, leadership, and kindness. I'm so proud to be a woman in Congress!
I will always advocate for North Country businesses. Thanks to the @pressrepublican for recognizing my work! Read about the @NBRC_Team's grant for the new Adirondack North Country Center for Businesses in Transition --&gt; #NY21
Too often, victims of sexual harassment are pushed aside while their harassers are protected. That's why I am co-leading the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act, which will eliminate institutional protections for harassers.
I have a long record of standing up for veterans, and am proud to cosponsor the VA Hiring Enhancement Act. Our veterans sacrifice so much for our safety freedom - the least we can do is ensure they get quality health care in a timely manner. Release --&gt;
This morning, I was honored to recognize Mike Long on the House Floor, who stepped down from the Conservative Party of New York this week after decades of service to our state and to our country. I’m proud to count him as a true friend.
The Natural Resources Management Act permanently authorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund -- a big win for #NY21! Thanks @AdkEnterprise for recognizing the importance of this critical bill.
This misguided legislation infringes on the rights of responsible gun owners across the North Country and is yet another example of Governor Cuomo’s failed leadership in our state. (4/4)
I also stand with our law enforcement community in opposing the firearm legislation signed by Governor Cuomo and championed by Speaker Pelosi earlier this week, which effectively boxes out law enforcement and hands their authority directly over to the courts. (3/4)
H.R. 8 infringes on the constitutional right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms, with little to no effect on deterring criminals. (2/4)
I am proud of my record as a strong supporter of the 2nd Amendment and of working across the aisle to enact common-sense reforms that protect our children, our schools and our families from senseless gun violence. (1/4)
I introduced the Vladimir Putin Transparency Act today with @RepValDemings. This bill asks U.S. intelligence to submit a report to Congress on Putin and his allies' financial assets and secretive networks. Read my statement --&gt;

Watch my opening question in yesterday’s @HASCRepublicans IETC subcommittee hearing, where I am Ranking Member: Department of Defense Information Technology, Cybersecurity, and Information Assurance Efforts. �️

I will continue to negotiate in good faith to fully fund securing the border, and I urge my Democrat colleagues to commit to doing the same. Read my full statement (3/3) 
As a Constitutional conservative, I consistently criticized President Obama's executive overreach. No matter the party, I will stand up against executive action that circumvents Congress. (2/3)
I believe the President declaring a national emergency that will take funding from military construction projects is the wrong decision. I voted in support of today’s resolution disapproving of the national emergency with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. (1/3)
I'm proud of my friend @SusanWBrooks for introducing this critical legislation that I supported in the House, and I'm thrilled that it passed. The #opioidcrisis is a nation-wide problem that has affected so many in #NY21. We can and must do more, and this is a significant step.
Navy veteran, 3-time cancer survivor, and #NY21 constituent Keith Koster is on pace to climb each of the Adirondack Mountains’ 46 peaks in one single year. Read this inspiring feature on his story from the @AmericanLegion! You won't regret it.
As an original cosponsor, I’m calling on Congress to fully fund the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund. Whenever one of our first responders is diagnosed with a 9/11-related illness, we should act swiftly to help them. I will advocate for our heroes at every opportunity! #Renew911VCF

I co-led an amendment to the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act, which allows the VA to provide child care to veterans in mental health crisis. It's critical they are able to receive help when they need it, not just when they can schedule it on a calendar.
I'm glad to see this letter in the @pressrepublican from an #NY21 constituent: "Elise stepped above the divide even crossed party lines to attempt to reopen government get my members paid and back to a somewhat normal life and I commend her for that."
I am a proud cosponsor of the Employer Participation in Repayment Act -- a bipartisan bill to help alleviate the crushing student loan debt many students are saddled with upon graduation. This is crucial for students, and crucial for our future economy.

I submitted a letter today requesting that my pay be withheld during this partial government shutdown:
This political brinkmanship is misguided and unnecessary. My offices will remain accessible for constituents who need assistance.
I oppose government shutdowns and in Congress have consistently voted to keep the government open. That’s why I voted to fund the government this week with additional funding for border security and disaster aid.
The next Secretary of Defense must uphold his commitment to strengthening our alliances and preserving U.S. leadership.
As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee, he has been a strong partner for those of us who believe that the U.S. must continue to lead to counter rising threats from adversaries like Russia and China.
