Agree, this is outrageous. To suggest that a renowned institution that serves thousands of students and invigorates our local economy should shut its doors is misguided and boneheaded.
It is wrong for President Trump to bypass Congress just so he can advance his own political agenda. I agree that we need to do more to secure our ports and protect our borders, but the President needs to work with us to do this, not take unilateral action.
There should be zero tolerance for acts of terrorism anywhere in the world. I join the international community in strongly condemning the terrorist attacks in India and offer my condolences to the families of the victims. #KashmirTerrorAttack #StandWithIndia
The compromise deal offered by bipartisan negotiators balances the urgent need to avert another government shutdown with reasonable steps to secure our border. I voted for it because I know this is a good compromise one that should serve as an example for future negotiations.
Since Members of Congress seem to be the only ones who get paid during a shutdown, then they should at least be required to work during a shutdown. MORE:
If the government ever shuts down again, my bill—the Keep Congress Working Act—would not allow Congress to recess or adjourn for more than 12 hrs.
More than 800,000 federal workers suffered as they struggled to make ends meet—16,000 of these living in my home state of Florida. And we’ve lost public confidence in our ability to get stuff done…not to mention it was incredibly embarrassing on the world stage.
I think we can all agree that there were no winners of the last government shutdown, only losers. American taxpayers lost billions of dollars in economic growth, money that should have been spent on improving our schools, fixing our roads, and paying down our debt.

“In life, your best defense against darkness, doubt, and despair will be your sense of purpose, your character, and your community.” So honored to have delivered a commencement address today at @UCF.  #ChargeOn, class of 2018.
The membership of @HouseBlueDogs has changed but our core mission continues: to fight for fiscal responsibility a strong national defense. Proud to lead our group of pragmatic Dems. We’re ready to work w/anyone to deliver results for the American people.
Today, we remember the lives lost and families affected by the #SandyHook shooting six years ago - a tragedy that rocked our country’s soul. These faces are a reminder of why we must end gun violence in America. I, for one, will never forget and never stop fighting. #FL07 #FlaPol
Tomorrow I will be delivering a commencement address at @UCF, which I’m so proud to represent in Congress.  The graduation ceremony begins at 9 am and you can watch it live here:

This debate is about keeping our promises and honoring this country's longstanding humanitarian spirit. I urge @POTUS to be mindful of this proposed policy's impacts on thousands of families. We can keep America safe and continue to uphold our fundamental American values. 3/3
I'm honored to be the first Vietnamese-American woman to serve in Congress. As an American, I'm deeply concerned by @POTUS' attempts to renegotiate the 2008 MOU between Vietnam the U.S., which would potentially deport Vietnamese refugees who arrived in the U.S. before 1995. 2/3
My family fled Communist Vietnam when I was a baby because they would have rather died in search of light than to have lived in darkness. Thanks to a program under President Carter, we resettled to the U.S., and I became a proud citizen of this great nation. 1/3
I recently spoke to @WomenInFP about what inspired me to join the @DeptofDefense and the House Armed Services Committee. I shared my views on why it’s so important for more women to work in the national security field.
Congress must pass a long-term extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which provides aid to survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. I’m a proud co-sponsor of a bill to reauthorize #VAWA and will keep fighting to protect access to these life-saving services.

Visited @RescueOutreach today to distribute meals to community members raise awareness during the holidays about homelessness hunger. I'll keep working to address the root causes of homelessness because no American should have to live on the streets or in a shelter. #Sanford

Although I wasn’t in Florida tonight, my heart was in Spectrum Stadium. Inspiring win by @UCF_Football to keep our undefeated streak alive, claiming back-to-back conference championships and again securing a spot in a New Year’s bowl. What a team a university! #ChargeOn #FL07
