Thank you to SBCA President Tom McGrath and co-sponsors South Boston Citizens’ Association, Mayor @Marty_Walsh, the Boston Elderly Commission and all our great volunteers at St. Monica’s Church hall.
Had a grand time at the Tom and Eddie Butler St. Patrick’s Senior Salute, a fun event with Corned Beef and Cabbage and Irish music.
(2/2) ..my amazing wife and daughter, all our nieces, and my irrepressible mother-in-law Helen who is 93 years young. Today on #InternationalWomensDay we celebrate the contributions of all women across the globe to the fight for women’s rights and equality.
(1/2) I have lived my entire life surrounded by strong women. As the only son I was blessed with a courageous Mom (who was a welder during WWII), five wonderful sisters who I remain thankful for their guidance... #InternationalWomensDay
My White House Ethics Transparency Act, included in #HR1 will ensure the American ppl know who is working behind closed doors in their government will stop fed agencies from being flooded w/former lobbyists consultants whose previous work present serious conflicts of interest
#HR1 includes my Bill, the White House Ethics Transparency Act, which will require the Trump and future Admins to promptly disclose waivers of executive branch ethics rules to the Office of Government Ethics – an independent agency that is authorized to ensure ethics compliance.
I'm proud to see #HR1 pass the House today, a bold ethics reform package created to end the culture of corruption that has overtaken our Nation's capital. We promised to restore our democracy bring transparency accountability to Washington this is a first step #ForThePeople
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a critically important agency that must be fully empowered to serve as an independent watchdog protect American consumers. Today @FSCDems reviewed the many harmful decisions Trump Admin appointees have made at @CFPB. #ConsumersFirst
I represent a district that includes coastal towns regularly impacted by climate change have issues w/their water supply b/c of the age of those systems. It’s encouraging to hear concern commitment to our states’ revolving funds to address this issue.
I know firsthand that despite state funding, local communities are being crushed by the expense of funding clean and drinking water projects. #InvestingInWater
Today the @TransportDems Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee held our first hearing on how Federal infrastructure investment can help communities modernize water infrastructure and address affordability challenges.
It’s disheartening over the last 2 years America's #drugcrisis has become a partisan issue, it wasn't always this way. To Dir. Carroll of @ONDCP I just had one request – please work with us to address the opioid epidemic because people are dying out there.
More than 72,000 people died from drug overdoses in 2017, yet for 2 years the White House had no Office of National Drug Control Strategy. Democrats and Republicans need to work together on this issue. @OversightDems #DrugCrisis
Today @OversightDems are examining the Trump Administration’s response to the drug crisis and the urgency for bipartisan action. #DrugCrisis
This week the House is considering #HR1 which will strengthen our democracy by making it easier to vote, reducing influence of big money donors in politics fighting corruption to ensure public officials are working for the interest of the American people, not special interests.
(4/4) Now the same company that will benefit from Kushner’s plan to transfer US nuclear technology to the Saudis purchased part of his family’s office building in NY, saving his family’s business. Should security clearance be given to someone w/such blatant conflicts of interest?
(3/4) Mr. Kushner had dozens of secret contacts with foreign government officials that he failed to disclose as required by law.  Yet he was given security clearance by the White House.
(2/4) Jared Kushner, who according to multiple whistle blowers, has actively discussed giving nuclear technology to the Saudi government without seeking Congressional approval as required by law.
(1/4) Today @OversightDems examined “GAO’s 2019 High Risk Report”, which determines those areas of government that pose the highest risk. I questioned the decision to grant top secret clearance to Jared Kushner.
Attended a series of briefings today at the International Monetary Fund HQ with Chairwoman Waters my @FSCDems colleagues to discuss how the US can help promote global financial stability sustainable growth. Thank you Dir. Christine Lagarde IMF officials for your hospitality
Thank you @NECouncil Pres. Jim Brett for hosting another wonderful New England Council Annual Congressional Roundtable this morning. Great to speak with everyone discuss important issues such as healthcare, infrastructure the upcoming agenda for Financial Services Committee.
Ambassador Ray Flynn and his family have been a blessing to our neighborhood and our City, and your award is richly deserved. Many thanks to @BCHighSchool for your hospitality last week as well. Go Eagles! �
A belated congratulations to Ambassador Ray and Cathy Flynn and the entire Flynn family for receiving the Paraclete Center Founders’ Award for your selfless devotion to the South Boston community.
Great to see all the business leaders of our port community in attendance. Thank you to Warren Dibble for the kind introduction and allowing me to give a brief update on trade policy and infrastructure funding issues in Congress.
Wonderful to attend the Boston Marine Industrial Park Business Association annual meeting at the Boston Design Center this evening.
I joined Fox News America’s News HQ Show to discuss Michael Cohen’s testimony to the Oversight Committee and our commitment to ensure President Trump obeys the rule of law. We will get to the truth.
Great to attend the Newmarket Business Association Annual Meeting and Charity Fundraiser last week. Thank you to Executive Director Sue Sullivan, President Michael Rothchild and John Fish Suffolk Construction for your kindness and hospitality. @NewmarketBoston
Wonderful time at the Annual Chief Marshal’s Banquet, and congratulations to this year’s Chief Marshal Lt. Colonel John Beatty, US Army who served our country for 23 years. Thank you @SBAWVC for hosting - great way to kick off the month of St. Patrick’s Day celebrations!
(2/2) Congratulations to recipients Allison Baker and Michael Dowling as well, and thank you to SBCA President Tom and Kathleen McGrath for another wonderful event to celebrate those who have given back to our community.
(1/2) Great to be at the Jimmy Flaherty Kick-Off Breakfast this morning. It was an honor to present the Henry Knox Unsung Hero Award to my friend Fran Dempsey, who owns one of the most trustworthy, helpful and reliable auto repair shops in South Boston.
Proud to join my colleagues to pass #HR1112 which would enforce a new process that allows the FBI more time to conduct a thorough background check on firearm purchases, extending the hurried 3-day period to a 10-day investigation. Another commonsense Bill to combat gun violence.
Yesterday the House passed #HR8 which would require universal background checks on all potential gun sales so individuals who are a danger to themselves and others are no longer able to purchase a gun. This is the first major legislation passed to address gun control since 1994.
Tune in to CNN Prime Time with @ChrisCuomo to hear me discuss Michael Cohen’s testimony in the Oversight Committee today.
Republicans ran away from the truth, and now Democrats are trying to bring the truth to the American people. #CohenTestimony
For two years, House Republicans refused to bring any of Trump’s convicted or indicted associates before the Oversight Committee, so today for the first time during the Trump administration, we have one witness who voluntarily is coming forward to testify. @OversightDems
Today the @OversightDems are hearing Michael Cohen’s testimony regarding conflicts of interest and illegal payments involving President Trump. The American people deserve to know the truth about their President’s actions and character. No more lies.
The use of the same flight paths while landing cause relentless noise and pollution over the same houses, schools, towns and neighborhoods every day. Enough is enough. #Quietskies.
Today in @TransportDems we pushed back on the use of the RNAV NextGen flight system used at Logan Airport, which forces tens of thousands of planes to use the exact same flight paths over the Towns of Milton, Hull, Dorchester South Boston when landing.
(2/2) The United States government should never forcibly separate children from their parents. Full stop. It is now our responsibility to ensure every family is reunited.
(1/2) Today @OversightDems voted to issue subpoenas to require DOJ, HHS and DHS to provide information about the children that were separated from their parents during the Trump Administration’s child separation policy.
As sea levels steadily rise and carbon emissions continue to escalate, we must take federal action now to confront climate change and make our Nation’s infrastructure more resilient. #ActOnClimate
Local leaders, like Mayor Martin Walsh of Boston and Mayor Tom Koch of Quincy have been vigilant in urging sustainable solutions to protect coastal communities from the effects of climate change. #ActOnClimate
Today @TransportDems are holding a hearing on how investing in federal infrastructure resiliency could help mitigate the impacts of climate change. During recent epic storms we have seen firsthand how the Commonwealth’s critical infrastructure has been threatened and undermined.
Always enjoy joining Jim Braude and Margery Eagan on WGBH Boston Public Radio. This week we discussed the Mueller investigation, my priorities as Chairman of the National Security subcommittee and other Oversight Committee responsibilities:
No President should be allowed to subvert the Constitutional authority granted to the elected Representatives of the people. With 227 cosponsors, Joint Resolution 46 must first pass the House and then will be voted on in the Senate.
Proud to join my colleagues as a cosponsor of the H.J. Resolution 46 to prevent the President from removing funding from existing programs for National Defense that were authorized by Congress and he already approved.
ABC Dallas News did a story about why a small town with no airport has over 1,000 registered aircrafts. My Bill, the Aircraft Ownership Transparency Act, would help address these serious national security risks posed by our aircraft registration system.
Tune in to NECN's "The Take" with Sue O'Connell tonight at 7pm and 10:30pm where I will discuss global and national security issues.
Extremely concerned by multiple whistleblower reports that President Trump is actively planning to deliver Nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia.  This would violate federal law and put our National Security at grave risk. Borderline insanity. @RepCummings @OversightDems

(2/2) I am very pleased to report that the Funding Bill we passed last week allocates $275 M to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration so they can catch up with pipeline inspections and better monitor pipeline safety compliance.
(1/2) In response to the proposed Weymouth Compressor Station and the West Roxbury lateral pipeline, I have been in frequent discussions with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
RT @SpeakerPelosi: Between our meetings at NATO Headquarters, we took time to visit the 9/11 and Article 5 Memorial. @RepGregoryMeeks led u…
Great to take a moment to converse with Lt. General Christopher Cavoli, the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Europe, at the Munich Security Conference Sunrise Breakfast, where I spoke briefly to assembled ministers about the US commitment to NATO.
(2/2) I'm pleased to report that the Funding Bill we just passed provides $12.7B to housing programs, including new housing for seniors and for persons with disabilities.
(1/2) The Boston Housing Authority, Brockton Housing Authority and Quincy Housing Authority are among the first public housing authorities in New England.
Massachusetts lost over 1,500 lives to opioids last year, a tragic epidemic that has swept the entire Nation. I am pleased to report the Funding Bill that we passed tonight includes $347M for local grant programs to help address the opioid crisis.
(2/2) .. as well as disabled/handicapped housing and funding for our state and local law enforcement with $423M Byrne JAG grants and $303M for Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program grants.
(1/2) Congress passed a strong, bipartisan funding bill tonight to prevent another senseless government shutdown. This Bill invests in critical needs such as national security, rebuilding roads and bridges, addressing the opioid abuse, creating senior housing...
(2/2) - such as requiring universal background checks, banning high capacity clips, restricting people on the “no fly” list from purchasing firearms, etc. We can honor their memory by fighting to make our communities safer from gun violence. #NeverAgain
(1/2) Today marks one year since the worst high school shooting in American history, where 14 students 3 staff members lost their lives in a senseless tragedy in Parkland, FL. We can honor them by passing common sense gun reforms to #EndGunViolence -
H.R. 1201 would also require federal agencies to develop corresponding plans to address the impact of climate change on their national security missions and to update these plans at least annually.
The Climate Change National Security Strategy Act would ensure our government actively prepares for the impacts of climate change in the development of relevant national security policies.
Climate change must become a bipartisan national security priority now. Rapidly rising sea levels threaten our power grid, our water systems and vital infrastructure. That is why I introduced my Bill, the Climate Change National Security Strategy Act, H.R. 1201.
Last month I signed on as a cosponsor of #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. This is a first step to combat gun violence, which killed nearly 40,000 Americans last year. Requiring background checks on all firearm sales is a commonsense law we must implement now.
(2/2) .. their healthcare and housing strategies to serve those in need. Democrats and Republicans need to come together on this. #EndHomelessness
(1/2) @FSCDems held our first full hearing on homelessness in America. Despite our best efforts, Massachusetts still has over 1,000 homeless Veterans. The #EndHomelessness Act would provide grants to help states and local authorities better align..
I’m proud that my Democratic colleagues kept fighting and refused to surrender to someone who showed such blatant disrespect for America’s workers.
It was the President’s reckless and irresponsible decision to shut the government down and use federal workers as hostages, forcing air traffic controllers and TSA employees to work without pay.
The lapse in federal funding burdened our overworked, unpaid FAA employees and disrupted safety-related work. H.R. 1108 will ensure that doesn’t happen again by providing funding from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for all FAA activities in the event of a government shutdown.
Today the Subcommittee on Aviation held our first hearing about the impacts of President Trump’s shutdown on U.S. Aviation where I spoke in strong support of H.R. 1108, which would allow the airline industry to operate during government shutdowns. @TransportDems
Guns with a magazine that can hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition have been used in some of the most horrific mass shootings in American history. Congress must act now and pass these modest, common sense laws so this history does not repeat itself. @RepTedDeutch
Today my colleagues and I took legislative action to address the spate of mass shootings in America and introduced the Keep Americans Safe Act. This Bill would prohibit the transfer, importation and possession of magazines able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.
More than 100 million people, or 83% of American workers, do not have paid family leave through their jobs and we must ensure people who work can take the time they need to address serious health and caregiving needs. #FAMILYAct
Proud to join my colleagues as a co-sponsor of the Family And Medical Insurance Leave Act, which would create a strong and inclusive national family and medical leave insurance program. #FAMILYAct
The Social Media Use in Clearance Investigations Act, H.R. 1065, willalso allow more efficient adoption of evolving technologies. Sincere thanks to Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-MD) for his great support. @RepCummings
The enhanced national security clearance process provided in my Bill, H.R. 1065, will better protect government workers, federal facilities and sensitive government information from malign individuals who may seek to threaten our National Security.
Very thankful for the support of my House colleagues today in passing my Bill, the Social Media Use in Clearance Investigations Act, which now heads to the Senate.
(2/2) Walter Jones’ passing is a great loss to the House of Representatives and to our Country. My sincere prayers and fond memories are with Walter, his family and the people of North Carolina.
(1/2) Deeply saddened to learn of the passing of my friend and colleague Walter Jones (R-NC). Walter was a good and decent man and an exemplary public servant. A true gentleman and a credit to the people of North Carolina who chose to send him to Congress.
Thank you to the Quincy Asian Resources organization, Mayor Tom Koch, Rep. Tackey Chan, Councilor Nina Liang and all of Quincy’s elected officials for your warm hospitality!
Wonderful time at the 31st Annual Lunar New Year Festival in Quincy, great turnout enjoying all the food and entertainment to celebrate the New Year of the Pig.
Glad to see the Veterans’ Access to Child Care Act passed in the House this morning, which will make the VA’s child care pilot program permanent and expand it nationwide, ensuring lack of child care will never prevent our veterans from receiving critical VA services. @VABostonHC
Very saddened to learn of the passing of U.S. Rep. John D. Dingell.  John was a WWII Veteran and rendered distinguished service as member of Congress for 59 years.  Our prayers and thoughts go out to his wife, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell and to their family. @RepDebDingell
(2/2) ..and their national government and restore trust and accountability to the infrastructure funding process.
(1/2) Thank you Governor Walz, Mayor Garcetti and Former US DoT Secretary LaHood for your testimony and providing your thoughts on my proposal to have infrastructure priorities come from state and local governments as a way to strengthen the connection between local communities..
(2/2) While the State has spent over $500m to aid repair efforts, the Federal Government must do more to facilitate commerce, protect the public and to make our airports, seaports, rail, roads and bridges more resilient to climate change, and we must make it a priority now.
(1/2) Great to attend the first full Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure hearing, where we are tasked with rebuilding America’s infrastructure. According to the DoT, Massachusetts recently had 483 bridges that were classified as “structurally deficient”.
I have heard firsthand from my constituents how debilitating airplane noise can be for those who live under flight paths, and the Air Traffic Noise and Pollution Expert Consensus Act is a first step to addressing this widespread problem.
Glad to see my Bill, H.R. 976, the Air Traffic Noise and Pollution Expert Consensus Act, was introduced in the House yesterday, which will require the FAA to sponsor an Expert Consensus Report on the health effects of airplanes flying over residential areas.
Early on the White House refused to say whether and when they had given ethics waivers to various lobbyists to go to work in the Trump administration, and my Bill, the White House Ethics Transparency Act in #HR1 will prevent this from happening in the future. #ForThePeople
HR1 includes my Bill, the White House Ethics Transparency Act, to maximize transparency and accountability by requiring the Trump and future Administrations to promptly disclose waivers of executive branch ethics rules to the Office of Government Ethics. #ForThePeople #HR1
The Committee on Oversight and Reform held a hearing this morning on H.R.1, the #ForThePeople Act, to restore the promise of American democracy by making it easier to vote, ending the dominance of big money in politics and fighting to end corruption in our government. #HR1
(2/2) Regardless of the circumstance you could count on getting a fair shake with Gary LaPierre. I never ducked an interview with him. He was in a league with John Henning and David Brudnoy, two other gentlemen journalists who are sorely missed. My prayers to Gary and his family.
(1/2) Very saddened to learn that Gary LaPierre has passed. A long time journalist with WBZ Radio, Gary was a class act - a true gentleman in what can be a tough business. In Politics, some days you’re pitching and on other days you’re catching.
(2/2) We convened to adopt Committee rules to exercise diligent oversight.  I am looking forward to our new agenda that will be focused on fairness and policies to benefit consumers, investors, small businesses and our economy.
(1/2) Great to get back to the Committee on Financial Services for the 116th Congress this week. I was appointed to the National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy Subcommittee and the Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee.
I am happy to see the House passed H.R.790, the Federal Civilian Workforce Pay Raise Fairness Act of 2019, to provide federal civilian employees a 2.6% pay increase. I spoke on the House Floor earlier this week to voice my strong support of the Bill:
(3/3) Unfortunately, sometimes it requires a stark example like this to cause government bureaucracy to respond.
(2/3) This explosion and fire in Michigan highlights the concerns surrounding the planned Compressor Station in Weymouth and the extreme danger that it could pose to local families who live near the proposed site.
(1/3) In response to the fire that occurred at the Michigan Compressor Station, I have already contacted PHMSA for a full report on what the cause may have been and damages incurred.  The PHMSA review is in progress.

I signed on as an original cosponsor because pay discrimination in the workplace is real and people doing the same work should receive the same pay. Women must be able to challenge pay discrimination and hold employers accountable. #PaycheckFairnessAct #EqualPay
Yesterday we reintroduced the Paycheck Fairness Act, H.R. 7, to make equal pay a law and add protections to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Fair Labor Standards Act. #PaycheckFairness #EqualPay
There are over 152,000 people in MA’s 8th Congressional District receiving #SocialSecurity and we owe it to every hard working American to give them the economic insurance they have paid for throughout their lifetime of work. #Secure2100
Proud to cosponsor the Social Security 2100 Act, H.R. 860, which will expand benefits, strengthen the system and cut taxes for over 10 million seniors throughout the 21st century. #SocialSecurity #Secure2100
(3/3) .. of treating our workers with respect when he shut the government down and forced federal employees to work without pay. President Trump further insulted them by freezing their pay for 2019. So it is only fair that we now treat them with the respect they have earned.
(2/3) This is also less than fast food workers who earn $15/hr. These TSA screeners are responsible for ensuring that terrorists are not able to blow up commercial airliners. I’m reminded of this every week I walk by them in the airport. The President broke the covenant...
(1/3) This morning I spoke on the House floor in support of a very fair Bill to provide a modest 2.6% pay increase for federal civilian employees. Our TSA workers’ base starting salary is $28,000, which is less than I earned as an Ironworker apprentice boy in 1972.
(2/2) .. your stories were compelling and further proof that we must take action now to reduce prescription drug prices, American lives depend on it.
(1/2) Great to meet the AARP members at our Oversight hearing today on Examining the Actions of Drug Companies in Raising Prescription Drug Prices. Thank you to all who testified on behalf of those affected by rising drug costs...
We discussed the John R. Justice Student Loan Repayment Program and the assistance it provides lawyers working as public defenders.  As interest rates increase, we must continue to work to ease the strains of repaying student loans.
Wonderful to meet with 3 great Massachusetts District Attorneys; Jonathan Blodgett, Essex County; Michael O’Keefe, Cape and Islands; and Anthony Gulluni, Hampden to discuss loan forgiveness options for public service lawyers.
This morning in Congress we are convening the first hearing of the Committee on Oversight and Reform to fulfill our Constitutional responsibility to protect our democracy and ensure that the President is accountable to the people and that he follows the laws. It’s a new day.
Thanks to my cosponsor @RepTedBudd all my House colleagues who helped pass H.R. 56 the “FinTech Protection Act”. My Bill creates a Public/Private task force to prevent terrorists criminals from exploiting emerging digital financial technologies in the consumer banking sector.
Happy to join Mayors @MayorBobHedlund @mayortomkoch @braintreemayor and the State and Municipal elected officials from Weymouth, Quincy and Braintree in opposition to the proposed Weymouth Compressor Station. If we stick together and fight hard, we can win.
A wonderful honor to attend @mayortomkoch State of the City Address in Quincy this morning. Mayor Koch charted an impressive vision for Quincy’s future. Happy to join Senator @SenJohnFKeenan Representatives @RonMariano @BruceJAyers @tackeychan @RepDanHunt as part of his team.
Thank you to @BCCStoCollege Executive Director Shannah Varón, the wonderful teachers, staff and incredible students! You give me hope!
Very proud to join Mayor @marty_walsh and Boston City Council President @CampbellforD4 at the Ribbon Cutting for the Boston Collegiate Charter School expansion. Beautiful work by our Union Building Trades.

The huge attendance shows the Brockton community’s commitment to protecting civil rights and working to eliminate discrimination of any form. As Dr. King said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
Wonderful honor to address the Brockton NAACP 33rd Annual Rev. MLK Breakfast, and special thanks to Brockton NAACP President Phyllis Ellis for hosting this heartwarming tribute to the life and work of Dr King.
Not only does releasing our itinerary to Afghanistan endanger us, as elected officials, but it also endangers the Diplomatic security teams, our military escorts and our staff.  The saddest part is I don’t think President Trump even gets it.
This would’ve been my 15th trip to Afghanistan and it is dangerous under the best of circumstances. To have the President of the United States put members of Congress in physical danger by publicizing our itinerary is extremely reckless and disgraceful.
I believe the public health and safety is threatened by the proposed Weymouth Compressor Station and we have no choice but to continue to fight against its completion. We are currently preparing a request for a full review of the air permitting decision.
