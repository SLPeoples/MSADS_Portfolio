Outrageous that Trump would try to build his wall on the backs of the men and women who sacrifice for us every
Recently joined my colleague civil rights icon @repjohnlewis in Selma to honor the sacrifice made by so many for voting rights. #ForThePeople is a power move by the American people to seize the reins of their democracy away from special interests. #HR1
We are already seeing some telecom companies slowing access to the internet. Proud to stand with consumers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses to take action to restore net neutrality protections. #SaveTheNet
Workers earning minimum wage are long overdue for a raise. @EdLaborCmte advanced legislation to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Next stop, the House floor. #RaiseTheWage
#ForThePeople Act expands voting rights, ends gerrymandering, and cracks down on corruption. Proud that my three bills to end restrictions on absentee ballots, restore election integrity, and let voters track absentee ballots to ensure they're counted are included in #HR1.
Honored to join my colleague and American hero @repjohnlewis and other members of Congress for a pilgrimage on voting and civil rights in Selma. And be able to share the struggle for equality and justice with my granddaughter Jane. #FPICivilRights
This not only impacts our military but jobs and our local economy. He couldn't get Mexico to pay for his wall. He couldn't get Congress to pay for it. Now he's forcing our men and women in uniform to pay for
After years of inaction Congress is finally moving to #EndGunViolence. Today we are offering more than thoughts and prayers. We are offering bipartisan legislation to expand background checks to all gun purchases, which I am proud to cosponsor. #HR8
With my support, the House voted in a bipartisan manner to protect 2 million acres - 1 million acres of wilderness and 1 million of #publiclands - from mining. This includes California parks such as Joshua Tree, Mojave, and Death Valley. #ForthePeople
A bipartisan House voted to uphold the Constitution and end President Trump’s national emergency declaration to fund his border wall. Trump is attempting to bypass Congress and raid funding from our military and military families.
In some countries the most important building is the school. Investing in America’s future generations starts with a commitment to our schools being the most important buildings in our country. I am happy to support the Rebuild America Schools Act to make that happen.
Ready to mark up #HR1 in committee. I’ll fight any attempts to weaken this key measure. It will increase access to the ballot box, end gerrymandering, and limit the influence of big money in politics. #ForThePeople
I'm joining my colleagues to block the #FakeTumpEmergency. The Constitution explicitly gives Congress the power of the purse. His attempt to redirect funds from Dept of Defense, especially military construction projects, will hurt military
The #ForthePeople Act will lift up the voices of everyday Americans and includes my election reform bills. #HR1 restores transparency, accountability, and integrity to our political system. Read my
Relieved there was no loss of life and only minor injuries but a reminder of the potential threat of gun violence. Thank you to San Diego Police Department for their response to protect life and find a
Proud to be an original cosponsor of the #FAMILYAct to guarantee #paidleave for working families. America is long overdue for national paid leave policy to give families greater work/life flexibility.
Rest in peace, Walter Munk. Thank you for daring us to ask questions and dream big. Your legacy of contributions to science, San Diego, and our country, will continue to move us forward in the pursuit of knowledge and a brighter
On Monday, I had the opportunity to meet some amazing animals and the people who take care of them at the @sdhumane. Thank you for the incredible work you do for animal welfare.
Wore white to #SOTU to honor women's suffrage. My constituents hoped to hear how the President was going to raise wages, lower healthcare costs end corruption. They didn't hear that. Instead, they heard a call for unity but on Trump's terms. That's not how bipartisanship works.
The Face of the Furloughed Feds. Honored to have furloughed federal worker and constituent Eric Schlumpf as my guest to the State of the Union. Eric missed two paychecks during the shutdown. #SOTU2019
I am Woman, Hear me roar! Great celebrating the incredible women of our community and the kickoff to #BlackHistoryMonth during Indivisible WATU Women of Color Roar breakfast.
#LGBTQ Americans can be blocked from serving on juries based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. I reintroduced my bipartisan bill to end this discrimination.#Equality
Ten years ago yesterday, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to protect workers from pay discrimination. I was proud to support that bill and also proud to help introduce today the #PaycheckFairness Act to ensure #equalpay for equal work.
The #TrumpShutdown cost our economy $11 billion, nearly twice as much as what he is demanding for his wall. Trump is running America like one of his bankrupt casinos - wasting money and running up
Excited to announce I've been named Chair of the Higher Ed Workforce Investment Subcommittee. I'll work to ensure that college is an attainable goal for students and look at expanding apprenticeship programs to let workers earn while they
While I’m glad the President decided to listen to reason, this could have happened 5 weeks ago thus avoiding the unnecessary suffering by the American people, who don’t want a wall. Top priority now is to ensure fed workers get paid, including back pay.
Innocent victims of the #TrumpShutdown. @HouseDemocrats have passed ten bills to reopen the government, including funding for smart and effective border security, only to have them blocked by Senate Republicans. #EndTheShutdown
Just voted for the ninth and tenth time today to end the #TrumpShutdown and reopen the government. Many federal workers are about to miss their second paycheck because Trump is not getting his way. #EndTheShutdown
Here are the results of my survey on the government shutdown. Thank you to all who responded. We had over 11,000 people take part. Keep in mind, this is not a scientific survey.
Right now #transgender troops are serving capably and courageously to protect the American people. This ruling is an insult to their sacrifice. If the Supreme Court won't uphold the ideals of America then we will fight to do
His words resonate with even greater importance today. #MLKDay
My latest survey is out. I hope you'll take a few minutes to send me your opinions on the government
Get ready for Team Davis in Casa de Oro! Have a question or need help with a federal agency? Then come down to my Office Hours. My staff will be on hand to answer your questions and see if we can help.

During these times, it couldn’t be more important that the administration follows our constitution to include all citizens for an accurate population count. Proper representation and resources are on the line. The spirit of our democracy is at
It’s a pleasure to have such a capable colleague as @RepScottPeters.  We are energized by the 116th Congress and working together for San Diego and the country!

Our nation's 42,000 Coast Guard members and 50,000 Coast Guard retirees are not getting paid. How can the president think it’s a good idea for national security to not pay those who protect us? #EndtheShutdown #TrumpShutdown
An increase in the minimum wage for America is long overdue. Proud to join in introducing legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. #RaiseTheWage
Our economy is about to take a hit that will cost more than what Trump is demanding for his wall. It's time to end the #TrumpShutdown and reopen the government. #EndTheShutdown

For the past two weeks, @HouseDemocrats have been passing bills to reopen the government #ForThePeople and will be doing so again this week. Senate Republicans and the President are the only ones standing in the way of ending the #TrumpShutdown. #EndtheShutdown
There is no safety net for the safety net. Millions of Americans are at risk of hunger and evictions. The president continues to hurt Americans who are already hurting. Let's end the #trumpshutdown and reopen the
If there truly is an immediate national security crisis at the border, why is the only solution a wall that will take years and years to complete? There is a smarter approach we can take to border security than wasting taxpayer dollars on a wall. #TrumpShutdown
Last week, my House colleagues and I voted to reopen the government – and this week, we’re doing it again. The House just voted to fund the Treasury Department and the IRS to ensure tax refunds are not delayed. I urge the Senate to take up this bill and end the #TrumpShutdown.
Undoing the #ACA would send our country back to a time when being a woman was a pre-existing condition. I’m fighting against GOP efforts to dismantle the care you’ve come to count on. #ProtectOurCare
First, it's spelled "forest." Second, a majority of the forest land in California is controlled by the federal government. Third, what kind of person hurts fellow Americans who are already
97% of Americans support passing commonsense background check laws – and yet these bipartisan measures have been held up in Congress for years. Proud to join in the introduction of #HR8 today - the Bipartisan Background Checks Act. #NeverAgain

Filed my first bills in the #116thCongress! My election reform bills have been included in the #ForThePeople Act (#HR1) - the House Democrats' anti-corruption, campaign finance and election reform
With bipartisan support, the House passed two bills to restore government services to the American people and provide paychecks to federal workers. It's time for Congress to be the adult in the room and end the
Excited to be part of this most diverse historic Congress with our Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The joy of seeing families, children and a Congress that looks more like America is an honor and moment of optimism I will always cherish with gratitude  to my constituents. #116Congress

Congratulations to Judge Sabraw for being selected as the San Diego Person of the Year. His commitment to upholding people's constitutional rights helped put an end to Trump's inhumane family separation
Another child dies in custody. My condolences to the family who held out hope for a better life circumstance for their son. Investigations are only the first step in addressing yet another
Another victim of the #TrumpShutdown is the Violence Against Women Act. Trump needs to let Congress reopen the government so women can continue to access these critical
Someone who says they care about national security doesn't force federal law enforcement officers to work without pay. Trump needs to let Congress reopen the government. #TrumpShutdown
Wishing Justice Ginsburg a speedy recovery.
The #TrumpShutdown will only hurt people and San Diego’s economy. I voted against border wall funding in the House and it will be voted down in the Senate. The GOP controls all levers of government and has the responsibility to govern responsibly. #NoBorderWall
Federal criminal justice reform is long overdue. Glad to have joined my colleagues in voting for the bipartisan First Step Act. This bill paves the way toward a fairer and more equal criminal justice
There are two entry-level employment opportunities in my office—one in San Diego and one in D.C. Please help spread the word and encourage qualified people you know to
Don't forget about my San Carlos Office Hours tomorrow!
Trump needs to treat #climatechange like the devastating threat it poses. Joined in calling on him to heed the dire warnings of the climate change report of his government detailing catastrophic results if we ignore this real problem.
You can still get covered, California! The Texas court ruling has no impact on your ability to sign up for health insurance. The deadline to be covered by January 1 has been extended until Friday, December 21.Get covered at
GOP lost the midterms due to its radical opposition to the #ACA. This outrageous ruling shows that what Republicans can't get through Congress, they'll try to get through the courts. The Supreme Court must reverse this baseless lawsuit.
Get ready for Team Davis in San Carlos. Have a question or need help with a federal agency? Then come down to my San Carlos Office Hours. My staff will be on hand to answer your questions and see if we can help.
Sat down with minimum wage earners and heard how they struggle to make ends meet. It's time to give Americans a raise and increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour. #RaisetheWage #Fightfor15
This move to put polluters before people will hit CA hard putting our water and health at risk. It ignores science, law, and strong public support for commonsense protections for clean water.
Still time to get health insurance through Covered California. If you are eligible, you could receive financial assistance to help cover the costs. As always, my office is available to answer any questions you may have.Go to to sign up!
Honored to be present for this celebration of life for our 41st President, George H. W. Bush. How much we have learned of his leadership style that should inspire others.
Our veterans should not be shortchanged on their education benefits because of a computer glitch. I'm calling on the VA to ensure #veterans get their benefits and those veterans who were underfunded are made
Very few lived a life of public service that President George H.W. Bush led. He was a consummate gentleman statesman. My sincere condolences to the Bush family.
Since the end of #NetNeutrality, internet speeds are already being slowed. Congress must vote to protect internet access and freedom by restoring net

I join survivors, advocates, and colleagues in asking the administration to withdraw this proposal and start again.
This #TitleIX proposal turns back the clock on years of work that survivors advocates have done to protect students on campuses. I've heard from schools students concerned about the confusion and lack of accountability this new proposal would
Hunted to the brink of extinction in the 1970’s, Gray Wolves are making a comeback thanks to the #EndangeredSpeciesAct. However, they are still in jeopardy. I opposed the GOP bill to remove them from the ESA. We need to #StopExtinction.
Extremely saddened by the destruction from the fires across our state. So many lives lost and still many more people unaccounted for. I stand in support of our firefighters and first responders who are battling the fires and helping affected
As co-chair of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Caucus, I joined in thanking and welcoming EOD servicemembers to the Capitol as they talked about the work they do to protect our servicemembers from IEDs.
Happy #VeteransDay! Thanks to everyone who came out to honor the service and sacrifice of our veterans on this beautiful day. ��
As #VeteransDay approaches, we not only should thank #veterans for their service and sacrifice but ensure we are providing them with the benefits and care they deserve. Be sure to follow me on
Looking forward to working with all the incredible women who will bring diverse ideas and perspectives to Congress!
More shattered lives due to gun violence. Come January, thoughts and prayers will become debate and votes in the

Happening today! Team Davis will be on hand at the Mission Hills Branch Library to answer your questions about how we might be able to help with a federal agency.
More hate. More tragedy. More families destroyed. How do we process this? How do we say and mean it: Not here, not anywhere!
Fleet Week is always an incredible opportunity to show our appreciation for the men and women in uniform. I was honored to speak to the Midshipmen from the Naval Academy at Fleet Week's Innovation Zone.
Time change for my Mission Hills Office Hours. From 4:30 to 6:00 p.m. Team Davis will be on hand to answer your questions about how we can help with federal agencies at the Mission Hills Branch Library.
Thank you to law enforcement, the intelligence community, and postal workers for working together to swiftly identify and apprehend this person. We must still be vigilant in the coming
Proud of my perfect score! Thank you #AAUW for all you do promote policies that help women.
Democracies don't rescind the rights of the people; they are supposed to protect and promote rights regardless of race, gender, or orientation. This is not what America is about. #WontBeErased
Career-minded military spouses face significant challenges due to frequents relocations, licensing barriers, and hiring stigma. I talked with military spouses about my experience as a military spouse and what we can do to increase employment opportunities for them.
@abbydavissmith Hi Abby - I'm sorry you couldn't make it. There is information on my website and you can always call my office with questions. I will likely hold another Service Academy Information Night in the
Always a great privilege to be able to nominate worthy candidates to attend one of our nation's service academies. Thank you to everyone who turned out for my Service Academy Information Night last night and your interest in attending an academy and serving your country.

I was honored to speak at a solemn ceremony remembering the 17 brave souls we lost in the attack on the USS Cole 18 years ago today. We paid special tribute to San Diego native Seaman Lakiba Palmer who made the ultimate sacrifice protecting our nation's freedom.
Yesterday I had thoughtful discussions with two bright classes at Eastlake High School and the San Diego School of the Creative and Performing Arts. These visits always inspire me to ensure we are doing all we can to provide our children with a world class education.
They were great questions! Thank you for hosting me today. We had a good discussion of the issues.
Took part in East County Economic Summit with the East County Chamber East County Economic Development Council where we discussed ideas on growing east county's economy. While the economy is booming for some, too many are not feeling the benefits. We can start by raising wages.
Time is running out to avoid the worst effects of #climatechange. We must believe in science, end the rollbacks of environmental protections, rejoin the #ParisAgreement and work toward reducing carbon pollution. Our future depends on it. #ActOnClimate
Joined local letter carriers in denouncing Trump's plan to privatize the USPS. If mail is privatized, private companies will drive up prices on businesses consumers. That’s bad news. Employees customers would get the short end while Trump’s rich friends reap the rewards
Congratulations to astronauts Peggy Whitson and Ellen Ochoa for their induction into the San Diego Air Space Museum Hall of Fame! And to California's Frances Arnold for her Nobel Prize for Chemistry! Truly an inspiration for young women and girls to seek careers in #STEM.

Helped kick off (and donate!) San Diego Operation Dress Code. The clothing drive provides women #veterans w/ professional civilian attire at no cost to help propel them to successful post-service careers. TY to our veterans the many volunteers supporting those who served.
As one of 200 Representatives who filed this lawsuit against Trump, pleased to see the case move forward. This ruling is a big victory for the American people - who have the right to know the President's top priority is the country, not his bottom

Proud to join my colleagues in showing support for Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and calling for an FBI investigation into the disturbing allegations of sexual misconduct against Judge Kavanaugh. We need to the listen to the women coming forward.
After holding open a SCOTUS vacancy for over a year, GOP can't move fast enough on the Kavanaugh nomination. There needs to be a full investigation into the disturbing allegations of sexual assault against Judge Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee moves forward.
Today we remember those we lost and honor those who ran toward the smoke to save lives. #NeverForget #September11th
Sexism is systemic, even in professional sports. Thank you, @serenawilliams, for being a role model to your daughter and women everywhere. Congrats to Naomi Osaka, who deserves her incredible moment. Now let’s bring #equality to tennis and sports everywhere.
Every person deserves access to a high-paying career. Joined my colleague, Chairman Brett Guthrie, to host a hearing on ways to expand apprenticeship programs. Thanks to Mr. Mark Kessenich for testifying to the importance of keeping high-quality standards in apprenticeships.
Trump is under criminal investigation and should not be choosing justices who could decide his fate. The Senate should not consider Judge Brett Kavanaugh until the Mueller investigation is over. #StopKavanaugh
Where would hardworking men and women be without the organizing strength of our labor movement? #LaborDay#LaborDay2018
The memorial service for John McCain should inspire us all to reflect on what "greatness" in a nation is all about. Sacrifice for something greater than ourselves. And we should act with the abiding belief: we are all in this together.
The administration continues to show a blatant disregard for the rights and safety of our students. I will do everything in my power to ensure that all students have access to a safe learning
On the 55th anniversary of the historic "I Have a Dream" speech, we remember Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s call to justice and equality for all Americans. #IHaveADream

Secretary DeVos’ decision to eliminate gainful employment protections for students is yet another instance of this administration putting corporations before people.

In the summer months, millions of children lose access to free or reduced-price meals they get at school. I introduced legislation with @PattyMurray to #StopSummerHunger. This will be good for our kids, good for education, and good for our economy.
Honored to be recognized for my work on behalf of individuals with disabilities by the San Diego Access to Independence. We discussed ways to bring more resources to San Diegans dealing with homelessness disabilities.
Thrilled to have @PeterACallstrom CEO of @sdworkforce as my guest at the House Ed Workforce Committee’s Innovator Forum. Peter shared the importance of federal investments in workforce development programs how San Diego’s best practices can be replicated across the country.
As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Higher Ed, joined with Democratic colleagues to unveil legislation for debt-free higher education. Every student in America deserves access to a quality education that will result in a fulfilling career.

Leader McConnell should apply his own rule to this nominee and allow the American people to have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. #WhatsAtStake
Trump promised to drain the swamp and should have fired Pruitt a long time ago. Instead, he was allowed to rack up ethics violation after ethics violation. His record on the environment is even worse. His replacement should know that we will fight this assault on the environment.
@LeonardoVaneg17 Welcome to DC!  You can get Gallery passes at my office in 1214 Longworth. Office will be open at 9 AM on Thursday.
It is with great honor that I joined these service men and woman of our armed forces as they become U.S. Citizens. Their commitment to serve and to this country will add to the fabric of our country.
It feels great to be recognized for the way our office functions every day! A good work environment produces good work and sets an example as we push for fair and friendly workplace policies throughout the country.
Honored to be selected by San Ysidro Health as a "2018 Health Champion."  Community health centers such as San Ysidro Health perform the critical work of providing care to our most vulnerable populations. Their staff and providers are the true champions.
So inspired by the veterans, service providers volunteers at Stand Down, which connects homeless veterans with services support. Thanks to the many courageous veterans who spoke with me one on one about ways Congress can help. I commend you and thank you for your service!
I voted NO with 300 of my colleagues on the GOP immigration bill which would waste taxpayer dollars on building a wall and would not reunite separated families or provide real solutions for
The future of our democracy is on the line in the appointment of the next Supreme Court justice. As Leader McConnell has stated: “The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice.” We have the benefit of an election in 132 days.
Disappointed by the Supreme Court's decision. As a former school board member, I saw firsthand that everyone who is represented in their workplace by a negotiating process enjoys the benefits of union leadership. #JANUSvsAFSCME
The Supreme Court failed the American people today. We look to our courts to uphold our constitution and the ideal of equality. No one should be treated differently based on their country of origin. #NoMuslimBanEver

We should have zero tolerance for intolerance. I will vote NO on the Republican legislation to build a wall and will continue pushing for the reunification of children with their parents. #KeepFamilesTogether
My colleague and friend @repjohnlewis inspired the Aaron Price Fellows to "Get in the Way" and "Never Get Lost in a Sea of Despair."
Enjoyed thoughtful Q and A with the Aaron Price Fellows today.  Great questions! We talked mostly about how Congress really works, how young people can make a difference and about current border issues.
When we should be reuniting children separated from their families, the GOP immigration bills spend billions of dollars on a wall don't protect Dreamers or asylum-seeking families. Voting NO on both bills. Speaker Ryan needs to work on a bipartisan humane immigration bill.
Since thousands of children are still detained and separated from their families, the Administration owes it to the American people to tell us exactly how and when they plan to reunite them. #KeepFamliesTogether
