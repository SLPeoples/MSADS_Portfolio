It's a beautiful day for democracy.My legislation to require early voting passed as a key piece of #HR1.Key to participating in our democracy is the right to vote - which is more accessible to all w/ early voting expanded access to the ballot
Thank you, @repjohnlewis. Your tireless advocacy for the fundamental right to vote helped make this day possible.#HR1 #ForThePeople
BREAKING: #HR1 #ForthePeopleAct passes the U.S. House of Representatives. I was an enthusiastic YES for restoring the government to the people!
So excited to vote for #HR1 so we can get to work #ForThePeople. #HR1 will:� Reduce the influence of dark money and special interests on our elections � Make it easier to vote� Tighten ethics rules so we can put an end to the #CultureOfCorruption
Thanks to the @BrewersAssoc for hosting the Small Brewers Caucus. Cheers to craft and independent brewers fueling our local economies!
To ensure our govt is by the people #ForThePeople, we must ensure every American can cast their vote.  I intro'd a bill to enact early voting in PA nationwide b/c working, caring for family or unpredictable circumstances shouldn't impede anyone's fundamental right to vote.

The bill also aims to increase the use of public school facilities for community-based partnerships that provide students with academic, health, and social services, increase programs for early learning, special ed, STEM and the arts, and a number of other important priorities.

The pay gap doesn't just affect the women who are not making as much money as they are worth. It hurts families our economy. Women are the sole or co-breadwinners in half of all families w/ children - providing equal pay would dramatically improve the lives of their families.
It’s been over 50 years since the #EqualPayAct passed - yet women still make an avg 80 cents for every dollar a man makes even less for women of color). The #PaycheckFairnessAct will help us close the pay gap bring us one step closer to #EqualPay.

When I started at my law firm many years ago, I fought for a #PaidLeave program because without one I knew we would lose talent.Now, in Congress I'm cosponsoring the #FAMILYAct to fight for #PaidLeave for every workplace.

Impossible choices between job family are hurting the economy. #PaidLeave through the #FAMILYAct means moms  dads aren’t forced to leave the labor force to care for their families/health - reducing turnover for employers making workplaces more equitable and family friendly.

Today I voted for the #YemenWarPowersResolution in @HouseForeign, moving it toward a full House vote. The humanitarian crisis in Yemen must be addressed diplomatically, not with military intervention.
During my roundtable with labor leaders in #PA07, one thing was clear - too many people are getting hurt at work, there aren't enough people inspecting workplaces, and we must do more to protect American workers.
Why is the WH rolling back rules that protect American workers and create safe workplaces? Thousands of workers are injured - or worse, killed - on the job every year. We should be strengthening workplace protections, not weakening them.

Yesterday’s SCOTUS decision on transgender troops is sad and does not reflect the value of these hard-working men and women in uniform. We should be supporting ALL of our military members, and thanking them for their work, not discriminating against them.
It is better for women, for families, and for our communities when we empower women to make their own decisions about whether and when to start or grow their families. #7in10ForRoe
Thanks to the #GovernmentShutdown:-Families will be forced to ration their SNAP benefits for February-Food banks in #PA07 could see a twelve-fold increase in people who need assistance-Federal workers who are working w/out pay are looking to food banks and SNAP for groceries
.@SenBobCasey and I are calling for an end to the #GovernmentShutdown which has put SNAP and WIC under threat for the vulnerable women children who depend on these programs for access to healthy food in #PA07 - over 94,000 families in my district depend on SNAP, alone.
On Day 32 of the #GovernmentShutdown, I'm with @SenBobCasey at Second Harvest Food Bank. The longer this shutdown goes on, the worse the impact will be not just on Federal workers but on the communities that depend on programs like SNAP and WIC. Stay tuned.
I know that together—guided by the understanding that our journey toward a more perfect union will always be unfinished—we can endeavor to ensure ours becomes a country where the dignity of every person is respected.
On this day we honor a man but we also affirm our belief in his vision of equality freedom for all - and I believe that we can only truly honor Dr. King’s vision by asking hard questions of ourselves on the direction in which we want our country to go.
As we reflect on the state of our country, it’s clear that we have never been in greater need of Dr. King’s voice, of his moral imagination, of his willingness to brave the forces of injustice in the name of shaping a more equal and more just future.
Thank you to Dr. Larry Pickens for inviting me to speak at the Lehigh Conference of Churches for #MartinLutherKingJrDay to Rev. Thomas Sweatt Allentown NAACP for having me at their annual MLK event at St. James AME Zion Church in Allentown on this special day of reflection.
Together we march toward a brighter future - where women's rights are human rights, where respect for the rights dignity of our LGBTQ brothers sisters is implied, where health care is available to every American w/ an economy that empowers all of our working families.
I had the honor of speaking at the Bethlehem Women's March today and as one of the four women who are now part of Pennsylvania’s previously all-male delegation in the House of Representatives, I want to thank all the extraordinary women leaders in our community!

I’m incredibly grateful for their dedication to protecting our communities. But I am beyond frustrated that this shutdown has gone on as long as it has these dedicated folks are still working w/out pay. Enough. Dems Republicans must to come together to pay our public servants
WATCH: I stopped by the Lehigh Valley Airport to see how our TSA agents are holding up as they work without pay. George tells me “this is a tough time right now” but “there’s a lot of commitment to our mission and the duties of this role.”
It was an honor to give the opening statement at the annual Allentown #StateoftheCity. I look forward to continuing to work with Mayor O'Connell and using my role as #PA07's Congresswoman to support Allentown's growing economy and businesses throughout the district.
I am doing what I can to mitigate damage being done by the government shutdown - including introducing a bill to fund the Coast Guard and sponsoring legislation to get federal workers loan assistance but we need to reopen the government. Enough is
RT @_cingraham: #tenyearchallenge, federal minimum wage
Thrilled to join the @HouseForeign Committee and to get to work on policies that promote and advance the American values shared by constituents in #PA07 and all Americans - such as freedom, democracy, diplomacy, and equality.
RT @RepMGS: Watching my friend @RepSusanWild urge the Senate to #EndTheShutdown from the House floor! She’s leading the charge to restore f…
We’re introducing a bill to help federal workers w/ loan assistance while the government is shutdown. Our public servants are working w/out pay or furloughed from their jobs - scrambling to make ends meet because of a partisan fight they have no control over. #EndTheShutdownNow
