This AM, I met w/ the Vietnam Veterans of America talked about important issues like making sure they receive the health care they need passing the Blue Water Navy Act.
This is shameful. There's only one thing that money should be for, that's military pay pensions.

#ForThePeople Act is the first step to getting us back to a gov’t of, by, for the people again.
As a member of @HousePSC, I was proud we introduced a bipartisan amendment that stops the flow of illicit foreign money into our elections. We need to make sure Washington represents all Americans, not just the wealthy few, special interests groups, big corporations.
I was elected to address the problems facing our community through common sense solutions, that begins w/ cleaning up corruption in our gov’t making public servants actually serve the public again.
For too long, the majority of Americans have felt like they’ve been shut out of Washington. I hear that over over again in #NV03. That’s why the first piece of legislation I signed onto in my congressional career was H.R.1, #ForthePeople Act.
Heading in to vote #ForThePeople!
It was great meeting with the Nevada Veterans of Foreign Wars in my office yesterday! Looking forward to elevating their voices to make sure we honor the pledge we made to our veterans. #NV03
A quarter of Nevadans under 65 have a pre-existing condition they rely on the ACA's protections to remain insured. NV families should never have to worry about being denied coverage or higher premiums due to a pre-existing condition.
Today I voted in favor of a resolution condemning all forms of bigotry. There is no place for any form of hatred, bigotry, or intolerance in our country--but especially in Congress.
Together w/ @SenCortezMasto, @SenJackyRosen, @RepHorsford, @MarkAmodeiNV2 I am introducing the Jobs, Not Waste Act--legislation that will require the Department of Energy to find new job-creating projects for Yucca Mountain other than nuclear waste storage.

Today is #AAPIEqualPay Day—the day that, on average, AAPI women’s pay has finally caught up w/ their white male counterpart’s earnings in 2018. Wage disparities hurt women, families, the economy, which is why I am proud to help introduce the #PaycheckFairness Act.

We need an honest open process—one that works w/ local government officials communities, rather than ignores them.
