Today, the House passed once-in-a-lifetime legislation to end the #CultureOfCorruption in Washington, take money out of politics, return power to where it belongs -- with the people. About time. #ForThePeople #HR1
Michael Cohen gave sworn testimony. Will you? Under oath to Mueller or Congress? If not, get out of our Twitter feed and find a less obstructive way to spend your executive time.
What a concept: stricter gun laws = fewer mass shootings. And none of those laws stop you from hunting with your kids, shooting for sport, and protecting your house. BUT, with these laws you also can dance at a concert, pray at a synagogue, and learn in class with less fear.

During every second of #CohenCongressionalTestimony, keep this in mind: @MichaelCohen212 is willing to go under oath and @realDonaldTrump  is not. This is not Cohen’s word versus Trump’s. If Trump isn’t under oath, the state of the evidence is just Cohen’s word.

What a miss. With a gallery of many gun violence survivors @realDonaldTrump didn’t say a single word about stopping the most dangerous people from getting the most dangerous weapons. Well @HouseDemocrats will. In less than 12 hours we have a hearing on background checks. #SOTU

Now, on to what he did say: If @realDonaldTrump thinks we’ll make investigations of his potential misdeeds betrayals into a bargaining chip to trade for legislation, he’s sadly mistaken. We’ll walk and chew gun at the same time to protect our nation. #SOTU

Those days are over. Your life matters. Your child’s freedom to learn without fear matters. Your ability to go to church without going through a metal detector matters. And young black men, who we lose every day in our cities to gun violence, matter. #EnoughIsEnough
For too long, an NRA-controlled Congress failed to pass common sense gun laws, instead allowing the most dangerous weapons to be in the hands of the most dangerous people. Predictably, thousands have died. Congress would respond w/ moments of silence zero moments of action.
