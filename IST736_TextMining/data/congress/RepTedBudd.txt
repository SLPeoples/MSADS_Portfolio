On with KC O’Dea right now discussing border wall funding and the 116th Congress. You can listen live here:
The House will be voting on a Democrat funding bill that allocates zero dollars for the wall and has no chance of passing the Senate. I will most certainly be voting against this symbolic bill and hope that Speaker Pelosi will move past it quickly to get to a serious compromise.
Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and Chuck Schumer all voted in favor of the SFA. Today, policy has taken a backseat to political symbolism. “The wall” is something President Trump thinks is important, and because Democrats loathe the president they want nothing to do with a wall.
Back in 2006, a compromise immigration bill called the Secure Fence Act was supported by 90 Democratic members of Congress.  It included funding for "two layers of reinforced fencing" plus "additional physical barriers" along roughly 700 miles of border from California to Texas.
President Trump has been clear that he needs $5 billion dollars to start building additional physical barriers on the border. Why? It’s simple - because insufficient border security is a national security risk for our people.
Thread: This morning on the Today Show, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was asked if Democrats will support any money for building a border wall. Her answer? “No. No. No. Nothing for the wall." Now I understand this might be good politics, but how is this in any way a reasonable position?
Today, I am honored to once again take the oath of office to uphold the Constitution in the 116th Congress. I am humbled for the continued opportunity to serve #NC13.
This week's newsletter--&gt;
Tonight we took the first step in securing our Southern Border by funding President Trump’s wall.  I hope the Senate will follow suit so that we can deliver on a promise that has been made to the American people.
There are those that wish to secure our Southern Border with a wall and there are those who, for mostly political reasons, would rather see the government shut down than do any such thing.  Please know that I will be making this case until the very end.
If we are not willing to fight for a border wall now, do we really expect there to be a better opportunity when Nancy Pelosi is in power?  Now is the time for us to draw a line in the sand and make a very clear contrast.
The fact that we are even considering a bill with zero dollars for the border wall is nothing short of a complete surrender and it is my hope that President Trump will refuse to sign it.  Republicans have control of the House for 14 more days, but we sure aren’t acting like it.
I wanted let you know where I am on the government funding bill the House will be voting on later today:1 - I will be voting against it. 2 - I am encouraging President Trump to veto it if it passes.

We must STAND BY Israel - the world’s only Jewish state/our greatest ally in the region. Those of us in Congress must always remember the Holocaust isn’t ancient history and the murder of innocent Jews (in #Pittsburgh or #Israel) should be called out for what it is: pure evil.
If the Secretary of State cannot certify this, the bill would redirect that money to Israel’s Iron Dome system.
Last year, the first bill I introduced when I got to #Congress was the “No Bonuses for Terrorists Act,” which would direct the Sec of State that the Palestinian Authority and PLO have ceased all financial rewards to terrorists or their families.

I wholeheartedly condemn this attack on our Jewish brothers and sisters. There is no place in our society for anti-semitism. Amy Kate and I are praying for the families and friends of all those we lost today.
My heart is broken for the victims and families of all those we lost today at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pennsylvania. Places of worship are safe havens for those across our communities. No one should ever enter their place of worship with the fear of losing their lives.
The positive economic news keeps on coming: US economy grew at strong 3.5 percent rate in Q3 @FoxNews

We just finished up a very successful Veterans Information Session in Statesville. Veterans’ Affairs experts were on hand to discuss benefits that matter to those who have served our country. A special thank you to all those who came out to participate. #NC13
Just wrapped up another open house with Industries for the Blind in Greensboro. We also recognized National Disability Employment Awareness Month. I enjoyed meeting their hardworking associates and viewing the products they make for the federal government, primarily the U.S Army.
Today, @realDonaldTrump signed H.R. 6 into law, which is the most significant action taken against a drug crisis in history. My bill, the COACH Act, is a part of this new law. It is my hope that this is the beginning of the end for the drug crisis in America.
I join @VP in strongly condemning these attacks on President Obama, the Clinton's and CNN. There is no place on our democracy for these evil actions. I am glad to see the administration is having the @FBI and @SecretService investigate these crimes.
I was honored to join BAM Nutrition for their 5 year anniversary and ribbon cutting. BAM is celebrating their brand new location in Lexington on North Main Street. Another growing business right here in #NC13
I really enjoyed being at the Rowan County Farm Bureau Annual Dinner tonight at the Country Life Museum—it brought me back to my roots. Our #NC13 farmers are a major part of the economic success we are seeing across North Carolina.
