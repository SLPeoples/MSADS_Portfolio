Story from NYT here:
These facilities were not safe when the Trump administration started its zero tolerance policy, pushing more children into detention. As the administration separated more children, allegations of sexual abuse spiked. ORR should be eager to meet with Congress to fix this.

I’ve waited too long to vote YES on basic gun safety bills. I will proudly do so this week. Trump’s veto threat shows that he stands with gun corporations over the American people who broadly support background checks and don’t have a corrupt view of 2A.

The Trump Administration pretends that the option to buy a gun online without a background check is the only thing preserving the 2nd Amendment. That is a dangerous, extremist position.
Should we “do something” to stop 40,000 gun deaths per year?Yes. Can we have gun rights at the same time we have strong effective gun safety laws?Yes. Will @dloesch do everything she can to stop change that will save lives?Sadly, yes.

Allowing gun sales without background checks has deadly consequences. In Charleston. In Sutherland Springs. In Aurora. We’ve got to give law enforcement the time and the tools to conduct background checks prevent prohibited sales.

If we can reduce gun violence by raising the minimum age a person can buy a shotgun or rifle, then we should do exactly that. I am proud to introduce legislation that raises the minimum age to 21. We can save lives.

I’m horrified by the news out of Aurora. I’m grateful for the first responders. And I am praying that this terrible news not get even worse as more information comes
A year ago we were told the gun lobby controlled what happened in Washington, so change wouldn’t come.#MSDStrong rejected that notion. The student activists marched, mobilized, and inspired a movement that impacted the election.Change is moving forward.
President Trump would rather steal money from our military, which actually fights national security threats, for his made-up national emergency. He said those military funds “didn’t sound too important to me.”Even more evidence that this is nothing more than a political ploy.
Not a national emergency: our southern border A real national emergency: 40,000 American deaths/year from gun violenceA real national emergency: climate changeStealing money from our military hurricane recovery efforts is cruel. And it’s unconstitutional.
President Trump’s emergency declaration is a farce his wall is about vanity not security.
In 2016, American voters sent Republican majorities to both the House and Senate. They wouldn’t give Trump his wall. In 2018, voters elected Dem majority in the House Rs kept control of the Senate. Neither voted to give Trump his wall.

“I went to the cemetery on Sunday. The first place I went to was Meadow. I just got out of the car, and I lost it. I was ugly crying. I apologized for what happened to her. I told Jaime that my daughter dedicated her competitive dances to her.” - Sarah Lerner, MSD English Teacher
