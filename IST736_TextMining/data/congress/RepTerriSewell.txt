It was great joining @apalmerdc and @RepEscobar today about how we can support more women running for Congress! We closed the Women Rule podcast with the best advice I’ve received, not surprisingly, from my mom — be authentically you, and define yourself for yourself. #runwithus
.@RepEscobar and I are live from @sxsw this morning with @apalmerdc! Tune in to hear the Women Rule podcast and hear about our experiences in Congress. #RuleWithUs and join the conversation! 
H.R. 1 is a historic bill to give the power back to the American people by ensuring government works #ForThePeople. And I’m proud it lays the foundation to #RestoreTheVote and put the teeth back into the Voting Rights Act of 1965!

I’m excited to join @amjoyshow this morning! Tune in soon to hear about Congress’ latest push to protect voting rights #RestoreTheVote
Government industry must work with #HBCUs to fix the 200 years of funding inequity HBCUs have faced. That’s why I’ll represent the @HBCUCaucus at #SXSW this Sunday! Join us:
I'm hosting a discussion @sxsw Sunday with @ProfessorCrunk @DewSteele and @heatherscope about the record number of women who ran and won in 2018! Check out our panel here:  #WomenWon #IWD2019
Great joining @jimsciutto this morning ahead of the historic vote on H.R. 1, The For the People Act. We voted today to ensure government works #ForThePeople and Americans can make their voices heard at the ballot box!
Happy #InternationalWomensDay !! Today we honor so many amazing, trailblazing women, like Shirley Chisholm, Rosa Parks and Hillary Clinton, who have not only opened doors, but have also changed our lives!
The House just passed HR 1, a historic bill to give power back to the people!  Limiting influence of $$ in our elections Expanding access to the ballot box Prohibiting voter roll purges ending partisan gerrymandering THIS is what Democracy looks like! #ForThePeople
When working to reduce drug prices, it’s very important to me that Congress seeks input from those who interact daily with patients, including pharmacists from Aliceville and Selma!
Hello Austin! Stop by the #CarveratSxSW this Saturday at 6:30pm. I'm joining @HigherHeights to talk about how Black women are shifting the culture, from #BlackLivesMatter to #BlackWomenLead. RSVP here: @sxsw
Last weekend, I welcomed nearly 50 of my congressional colleagues to Selma to remember #BloodySunday the sacrifices so many made to transform our society. I know I walk the halls of Congress today because of the giants who came before me and their quest for equality justice.
The Foot Soldiers' courage led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a landmark federal achievement of the Civil Rights Movement. I’m working to advance their legacy by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act and working to #RestoreTheVote.
On #BloodySunday – March 7, 1965 – everyday Americans, Foot Soldiers and Civil Rights leaders set out from Brown Chapel to march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge towards Montgomery, where state troopers attacked the nonviolent marchers with billy clubs and tear gas.
On this date, March 7, 1965, Amelia Boynton Robinson was beaten unconscious on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday so that every American citizen could have the right to vote! #RestoreTheVote
I am so proud that the @HouseNewDems have joined with me to #RestoreTheVote. No American citizen should be limited in their access to the ballot box!
AL has turned down federal funding for #MedicaidExpansion for SIX YEARS. Now, AL is among the states w the most rural hospitals at risk of closing their doors, limiting critical access to health care and killing THOUSANDS of jobs. It’s time to expand!
@sxsw On Saturday, I’ll sit down with POLITICO’s @apalmerdc and @RepEscobar for a LIVE taping of Anna’s Women Rule podcast. You can RSVP here:
This weekend I’ll be at @sxsw to talk about how #WomenRule #BlackWomenLead, #HBCUs and how #WomenWon in 2018!
If Alabama expands Medicaid, we could bring back $2 billion Alabama taxpayer dollars, provide 360,000 Alabamians with health care, and shore up rural hospitals and their local economies. The choice is clear!
88% of rural AL hospitals are operating in the red. 13 AL hospitals – 7 in rural areas – have closed since 2011. These hospitals provide critical care and jobs for hundreds of Alabamians. Gov. Ivey must #ExpandMedicaid now to help our struggling hospitals!
March is #WomensHistoryMonth, a time to recognize and celebrate the incredible trailblazers who have changed the world. The 116th Congress brought a record 131 women to the House Senate! But #HERStory reminds us that our work isn’t over we must continue fighting for equality!
I’m praying for the families impacted by the tornado in Lee County today, and especially for those whose loved ones were victims of the storm.
My friends @hillaryclinton and @corybooker have a long history of speaking up for the voiceless and calling out hate when they see it. It was great having them in Selma this morning to commemorate the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.
Join me, Secretary @HillaryClinton, @SenBooker and so many others in Brown Chapel AME this morning:
The Giants of the Civil Rights Movement — ordinary Americans who did extraordinary things — answered the call for justice and equality. Today, as we honor and commemorate their sacrifices and successes, we must remember to not only protect their legacy, but advance it.
Secretary @HillaryClinton is in Selma with us this morning to commemorate the 54th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery Bloody Sunday March.
The struggle to have our voices heard and counted is a series of stories that must be preserved and recounted so that future generations will #NeverForget.
Today, we honor the courage and tenacity of Civil Rights leaders, Foot Soldiers and everyday Americans on #BloodySunday who worked together to achieve extraordinary social change.

.@repjohnlewis said today that without music, the Civil Rights Movement would have been like a bird without wings. Singers like Bettie Mae Fikes inspired and united marchers in their quest for justice and equality. This little light of mine.. ��
It was so great to join the @NAACP_LDF at my home church this afternoon. This weekend we commemorate the 54th anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery Bloody Sunday March where Civil Rights Giants marched, prayed and died for the right to vote. We need to #RestoreTheVote!
RT @CaraMcClellan6: @RepTerriSewell on the need for HR4 at @NAACP_LDF’s voting rights panel at the #SelmaJubilee.
It’s so good to be back at my home church, Brown Chapel AME! @ Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church
It’s not lost on me that I am able to walk the halls of Congress because of so many giants who came before me. To walk in @repjohnlewis footsteps with John Lewis is an incredible privilege.
The people’s agenda depends upon democracy, and the base of the democracy is the right to vote. We must #RestoreTheVote!#ForThePeople
The ⁦@eji_org⁩ ⁦@MemPeaceJustice⁩ never ceases to amaze and inspire.
What a morning with ⁦@FaithNPolitics⁩, ⁦@SenDougJones,⁩ Pastor Price and Mary Liuzzo Lilleboe, daughter of Viola Liuzzo, and so many more!
We prayed today for the little girls killed at the 16th Street Baptist Church so many years ago. We will #neverforget Addie May Collins, Carol Denise McNair, Cynthia Wesley and Carole Robertson.
It’s an honor to welcome so many of my congressional colleagues — including @SenDougJones @LeaderHoyer — to the 16th Street Baptist Church today.
Celebrating the Foot Soldiers of the Civil Rights Movement, like ⁦@repjohnlewis⁩, who marched, prayed and died for the right to vote is what this weekend is all about.
It’s all fun and games until the rain comes!! �
Kicking off ⁦⁦@FaithNPolitics⁩ this year with a performance of the 4 Little Girls play with student actors from Montgomery Public Schools!
Today in #BlackHistoryMonth, I’m recognizing Mobile native Alexis Herman, the first African-American Secretary of Labor! Ms. Herman has a long history of service, working to desegregate Mobile schools, as a social worker and leading programs to provide apprenticeships for women.
Today in #BlackHistoryMonth I’m recognizing Johnnie Carr, a #shero from Montgomery who never stopped fighting for equality. Ms. Carr was central to planning the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and served as Montgomery Improvement Association president after Martin Luther King Jr.
Today we demanded more than thoughts and prayers – we demanded action. I’m proud to co-sponsor the Bipartisan Background Checks Act and with it’s passage today, we proved that we will not stand by while gun violence rips apart our communities. #HR8
This weekend we will mark the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. I hope the @FaithNPolitics Pilgrimage will help us reflect on all that we can do to advance justice and equality in our nation. #BlackHistoryMonth
The foot soldiers of the Civil Rights Mvmt marched, fought and died for the right to vote one of my greatest honors was passing a bill to award them a Congressional Gold Medal. In introducing the Voting Rights Advancement Act today, I am proud to protect advance their legacy.
Voting is the cornerstone of our democracy. Everything starts with the vote – representation, districting policies that impact every single American. We must restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to ensure every American can make their voice heard!
Heartbreaking news out of Montgomery today where a 17-year-old was shot at school. I am praying for the victim’s full recovery. It’s time to enact common sense gun safety to keep our communities safe. Americans have a right to not live in fear of this type of violence.
A strong democracy removes barriers and improves access, so EVERY citizen can vote.We MUST restore the VRA and #RestoreTheVote
That’s why 207 of my House colleagues and I are introducing legislation today to #RestoreTheVote by putting the teeth back into the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Since the Supreme Court’s Shelby decision, changes to some state voting laws are leading the United States in the wrong direction. When Americans are not able to cast their ballot, their voices are left behind. #RestoreTheVote
I am proud to stand with my colleagues @speakerpelosi @senschumer @repjohnlewis @senatorleahy @sendougjones today to stand up for voting rights! #RestoreTheVote
RT @thehill: .@RepTerriSewell: "For a more perfect union, Restore the Voting Rights Act" (@TheHillOpinion)
.@repjohnlewis and so many other Americans – fortified by their quest for justice – were beaten bloody during Bloody Sunday in 1965. He is a constant inspiration in our fight for equality and justice every day. #BlackHistoryMonth
As we approach the 54th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, I want to recognize my friend and colleague @rejohnlewis, the “boy from Troy,” who is always getting into what he calls the good kind of trouble! #BlackHistoryMonth
Our democracy depends on every American being able to make their voice heard through the ballot box. That’s why I’m leading the charge to #RestoreTheVote.
My staff honored the brave men and women of the Selma and Dallas County police today for their dedication day in and day out to make our community safer. Thank you!!
Civil rights lawyer Fred Gray worked tirelessly to advance justice throughout AL and the South. He defended Rosa Parks, @NAACP and many others, promoting justice throughout Alabama and the South, and led the legal charge to integrate @AuburnU. #BlackHistoryMonth
Richard C. Boone was a civil rights activist who spent his life fighting for justice and equality. Mr. Boone is perhaps best known for his work organizing the Selma to Montgomery marches, where led 800 students to Montgomery to join MLK and 25,000 marchers. #BlackHistoryMonth
Mr. Sutton has made a lot of poor decisions, but stepping down is the right thing to do. Now, he must apologize.
Today we honor the thousands of ordinary Americans who participated in the #MontgomeryBusBoycott, including the nearly 100 who were arrested on this day 63 yrs ago. These ordinary Americans’ sacrifice and courage in the name of justice will never be forgotten. #BlackHistoryMonth
Thanks to all who attending our Town Hall meeting in Bessemer tonight! Great turnout and awesome discussion! #ThisIsWhatDemocracyLooksLike
Great meeting with @HICAtweets today about protecting TPS and our #Dreamers. Dreamers are our neighbors, friends, coworkers and church members. Above all, they are Alabamians who have only ever known the United States as home.
During WWII, African Americans in many states were still subject to discriminatory Jim Crow laws and the American military was racially segregated, but the airmen’s impressive combat record and achievements paved the way for full integration of the US military. #BlackHistoryMonth
Today in #BlackHistoryMonth, I’m highlighting the great Tuskegee Airmen! They were the first African-American military aviators in the U.S. Armed Forces and some of the best pilots in the U.S. Army Air Forces.
Dr. Juanakee Adams is the first African-American female optometrist to practice in Alabama. Living by the saying "unto much is given, much is required," Dr. Adams gives back by mentoring young optometrists as they launch their careers. #BlackHistoryMonth
REMINDER: I'm looking forward to meeting with Jefferson County residents at our first town hall of 2019 this THURSDAY, February 21 at the Bessemer Recreation Center! You can sign up here:
Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth was a fearless freedom fighter and tenacious Civil Rights leader who always stood up for what was right. Despite multiple attempts on his life, Shuttlesworth persevered and reminded his family and community to always forgive. #BlackHistoryMonth
Next week, I will introduce HR 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, to help address the most egregious forms of voter suppression, like GA saw in Nov 2018 when the Republican candidate for gov put 53,000 voter registrations on hold, nearly 70% of which belonged to black voters.
.@StaceyAbrams testified abt her experience in the GA House and as a candidate for governor. Her testimony makes it clear that Congress must act to rectify the ongoing injustices that many voters, especially minority voters, face when they go to the ballot box! #RestoreTheVote
I am in Atlanta, Georgia today taking part in a congressional field hearing on voting rights!
For the millions of people of color who have been terrorized by white supremacy, this kind of “editorializing” about lynching is not a joke – it is a threat. These comments are deeply offensive and inappropriate, especially in 2019.  Mr. Sutton should apologize and resign.
Joe Louis, known as the “Brown Bomber,” was one of the best heavyweight boxers of all time. He reigned as the world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949 and had a career record of 66 wins and 3 losses! #BlackHistoryMonth
As Alabama’s first black Congresswoman, I stand on the shoulders of giants like Jackson who fought, bled and died for the right to vote. #BlackHistoryMonth
Jackson was inspired by Dr. King to help advance the civil rights movement and, before his death, he tried repeatedly to register to vote, but could not due to discriminatory Jim Crow laws. #BlackHistoryMonth
Today, on #JimmieLeeJacksonDay, I'm recognizing Jimmie Lee Jackson who was beaten and killed by police in a peaceful civil rights march. He was just 26 years old. #BlackHistoryMonth
Attorney Oscar Adams was a trailblazer who was no stranger to “firsts.” He was the first African-American Alabama Supreme Court justice and the first African American elected to statewide office in Alabama. #BlackHistoryMonth

One of the first bills I got signed into law honored Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole and Denise with a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress can bestow upon a civilian. I was honored to attend the bill signing with President @BarackObama and the girls' relatives.
The lead perpetrator – a Klan leader who boasted about his role – was not brought to justice for more than 10 years after the bombing. Nearly 40 years later, @SenDougJones prosecuted the two remaining suspects. #BlackHistoryMonth
The bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church was the third in 11 days after a federal court order had come down mandating the integration of Alabama’s school system. #BlackHistoryMonth
At 10:22 a.m. on the morning of September 15, 1963, Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley, Carole Robertson and Denise McNair were killed by white supremacists who bombed Birmingham’s 16th Street Baptist Church. #BlackHistoryMonth
I am proud Congress put partisan politics aside and came to a consensus today to avert another shutdown, increase border security funding, deliver a hard-earned pay raise for federal employees and invest in our crumbling infrastructure.
The President is pounding his fists after failing to secure billions of dollars for an ineffective wall that most Americans don't support. Instead, he should be addressing the real emergencies facing our country – crumbling infrastructure, gun violence the opioid crisis.
Jefferson County residents: I’m holding a town hall next Thursday, February 21 at the Bessemer Recreation Center at 6:00 p.m. I look forward to answering your questions and discussing our priorities for the year! Sign up here:
Oscar-winning actress and Montgomery native @octaviaspencer was the first black actress to receive two consecutive Academy Award nominations in back-to-back years and continues to break down barriers in the film industry.#BlackHistoryMonth
I'm proud to give my State of the District Address for Alabama's 7th District. We've accomplished a lot together, but there is always more work to be done. Here are some of the highlights from 2018 and what lies ahead in this new year:
Today marks one year since the deadliest high school shooting in U.S. history. Join me today in pausing to remember the 14 Parkland students and 3 teachers who were killed, the 17 who were injured and the hundreds more who survived that awful day.
Data shows that most claims of voter fraud turn out to be baseless. Fearmongering from our elected officials – especially those who oversee our elections – is shameful. While voter fraud is not acceptable, we must pursue policies that make it easier to #vote, not harder.
Over 90% of rural hospital closures have been in states that didn’t expand Medicaid before the closure. This is the 7th rural hospital in AL to close in 8 years. Do the math! It’s time for @GovernorKayIvey and the AL state legislature to expand Medicaid.
Booker T. Washington was one of the most well-known African American leaders during the late 19th and 20th centuries who founded the institute that would become Alabama’s very own @TuskegeeUniv! #BlackHistoryMonth
The President should support the bipartisan, bicameral deal that House and Senate leaders struck this week to keep the government open and avoid another #TrumpShutdown.
During the last government shutdown, 62% of federal workers depleted most or all of their savings; 42% took on debt; 25% borrowed from retirement accounts; and 25% visited a food bank. They can’t afford another #TrumpShutdown.
This honor is well-deserved. Judge England is a man of profound character who has dedicated his life to serving the people of Alabama. Congratulations, Judge England!
At the 1936 Olympics in Nazi Germany, Jesse Owens won four gold medals, making him one of the greatest athletes in track and field history. His greatest triumph, though, was shattering Hitler’s myth of white supremacy. #BlackHistoryMonth
Glad my staff was a able to witness our constituent, Patrick Knowles Jr., take the oath of allegiance during his Naturalization Ceremony at USCIS’ Montgomery Field office today! Congratulations, Patrick!
Working families are suffering from the #GOPTaxScam’s broken promises. Americans deserve a government – and a President – that works #ForThePeople, not for their rich friends.
Vivian Malone was the first African American to graduate from the University of Alabama. Despite attempts by Gov. George Wallace to block her enrollment and violent threats to her safety, she persisted, helping shape the University of Alabama we know today. #BlackHistoryMonth
Montgomery native Nat King Cole rose to international fame during the 1950s. His many hits like "The Christmas Song" and "L-O-V-E" have withstood the test of time, making him a household name. #BlackHistoryMonth
Daniel "Chappie" James Jr. was an American fighter pilot in the Air Force, who became the first African American General to pin on four stars. He was a product of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute and instructed the legendary Tuskegee Airmen during World War II. #BlackHistoryMonth
Alice Coachman Davis was the first black woman to win an Olympic gold medal! Davis had to overcome many disadvantages growing up under discriminatory Jim Crow laws, but persevered and captured high jump gold in 1948. #BlackHistoryMonth
My prayers are with the Dingell family today. Former Congressman John Dingell was a giant in the House. From passing Medicare to helping lead the fight for the Civil Rights Act, his lifetime of contributions will be enjoyed for decades to come. May he Rest In Peace.
The Trump administration is siding with predatory payday lenders instead of with the American people. Payday lenders charge interest rates as high as 400%, trapping Americans in seemingly inescapable cycles of debt. Just shameful.
Calling all artists! Our annual Congressional Art Competition for high school students is open, and the deadline for submissions is approaching! Submit your work soon!Find more details here:
Today in #BlackHistoryMonth I’m recognizing Chief Judge U.W. Clemon. He was of the first two black lawmakers elected to AL Senate since Reconstruction and Alabama’s first black federal judge. I was also lucky enough to serve as his law clerk before coming to Congress!
I introduced a bill with @RepRonKind to help protect our auto industry from the Trump administration’s reckless trade policy. The admin’s proposed 25% tariff on autos threatens the jobs of nearly 40,000 workers in Alabama. It’s bad for business and it’s bad for Alabama!
@maejemison When she was a little girl, Dr. Jemison remembers telling her kindergarten teacher she wanted to be a scientist when she grew up. She is just one of many examples of what little girls can achieve when they are given the support they need to reach for the stars.
Today in #BlackHistoryMonth I'm recognizing another #shero fro Alabama, Dr. @maejemison, the first woman of color to go to space!
Loved seeing Senators @dougjones and @chriscoons tonight at the #SOTU!
Ladies in white! We are wearing white tonight in honor of the record number of women serving in the 116th Congress. Not only are there 127 current female members of Congress, the members of the 116th make up the most diverse congressional class in history.
I'm honored that Mrs. Tiphanie Carter is representing the 7th District at the #SOTU tonight. I hope the President focuses not on what divides us, but on what unites us as Americans!
Honored to have Mrs. Tiphanie Carter to represent Alabama’s 7th District at the State of the Union! Her presence is a reminder of the dignity sacrifices of our law enforcement families and the need to end senseless gun violence. Thank you! #SOTU
“Hammerin’ Hank” @HenryLouisAaron turns 85 today! Happy Birthday! The Mobile native is one of the most celebrated athletes in American history. He broke Babe Ruth’s longstanding home run record 45 years ago this year. #BlackHistoryMonth
Sen. @JaboWaggoner is right! We need to expand Medicaid in Alabama. Premiums and health care costs are higher in states that have not expanded. And over 90% of rural hospital closures have been in states that did not expand Medicaid before the closure.
Sgt. Carter's service truly represents the best of Alabama’s 7th District. I’m honored his wife Mrs. Tiphanie Carter will join me tomorrow at the #SOTU. My congressional colleagues need to hear her story and act to prevent the senseless gun violence afflicting our communities.
This #SOTU I am honored to pay tribute to the bravery and sacrifices of our law enforcement officers. Sgt. Wytasha Carter was the kind of man that we all hope our sons grow up to be – a devoted and passionate father, husband, co-worker and member of the Birmingham community.
Happy 106th Birthday, Rosa Parks! Parks’ legacy reminds us that one small, bold action can cause great change. May we always summon her strength and courage as we continue to fight for justice. #BlackHistoryMonth
He famously said, “I don't know what the future may hold, but I know who holds the future,” a reminder that we all have a role to play in advancing justice and equality.
Ralph Abernathy was one of Dr. Martin Luther King’s closest friends and advisors whose work was central to the Montgomery bus boycott and the civil rights movement. #BlackHistoryMonth
Birmingham native Condoleezza Rice was the first female African-American Secretary of State and the first woman to serve as National Security Advisor to the President.#BlackHistoryMonth2019
Wonderful being in Montgomery this morning speaking with civil rights icons Doris Crenshaw and Lisa McNair, whose sister Denise was a victim of the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing, about how we can continue to advance Civil Rights in Alabama and our nation. #BlackHistoryMonth
Tonight I saw the most talented Montgomery Public School students in an amazing performance of “Four Little Girls”  @AlabamaShakes! A must see! #GreatJob!
Ms. Amelia Boynton Robinson’s activism was central to the Selma to Montgomery Civil Rights marches. She spent her entire life courageously and passionately fighting for equality and justice. #BlackHistoryMonth
Every day this #BlackHistoryMonth I will highlight Alabama’s Black heroes and sheroes. Today, that’s Ms. Amelia Boynton Robinson from Selma.
This #BlackHistoryMonth, join me in celebrating the extraordinary contributions and accomplishments African Americans have made to this nation and the world.
Federal employees, like those who work at the federal prison in Aliceville, depend on these reasonable pay increases to make ends meet. I’m proud the House voted today to give them a hard-earned 2.6% cost of living adjustment.
If women and men do the same job, they should get the same pay. That’s why I support the #PaycheckFairness Act!
Not only do over 1.1 million Alabamians rely on Social Security, but the program also lifted 437,878 Alabamans out of poverty in 2016. Social Security is sound policy and makes economic sense. That's why I’m proud to support #Secure2100
.@StaceyAbrams reflects our party’s shared values of equality and inclusion and is a brilliant choice to give the Democratic response to the State of the Union!
It is always a pleasure meeting with our Alabama United @MineWorkers! I’m working to make sure they get the pensions they’ve earned and the heath care they deserve.
Women in AL are paid 76 cents for every dollar paid to men. The gender wage gap in AL is projected to close in 2089. AL women working full time lose more than $11B a year due to the wage gap. It's time to ensure women get equal pay for equal work.
At our first Ways Means Committee hearing this Congress, we are focused on the importance of protecting health insurance coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions. It’s time to get to work to make health coverage more accessible and affordable #ProtectOurCare
My staff had the opportunity today to take part in the Growing Kings Mentoring Program at Hudson K-8 School in Jefferson County. These young leaders are our future and I’m excited they’re focusing on community engagement and advocacy!
Federal contractors like Ms. Hicks deserve to be paid for the job they were hired to do. I’m joining @RepPressley and @EleanorNorton in supporting a bill to provide back pay to low-wage contractor employees to help ease the burden of the Trump shutdown.
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, #WeRemember the millions of Jews and others who lost their lives during the Holocaust. We are all brothers and sisters and must stand united in the fight against bigotry and inequality today and every day.
To be clear, it is never a good idea to shutdown govt over policy disputes. The American people deserve better. I look forward to working in a bipartisan way to pass funding bills that reflect our shared values, respect our workers and invest in effective border security.
For 35 days, Pres. Trump’s govt shutdown has caused undue financial hardships on thousands of federal workers while inflicting needless pain on all Americans. While I’m glad POTUS finally re-opened govt today, it is never a good idea to shutdown govt over policy disagreements.
This indictment brings new info to light, namely that at the same time the President asked Russians to publish Clinton’s emails, a Trump campaign official was “directed” to contact Mr. Stone about additional damaging info released by Wikileaks. We must get to the bottom of this.
It is about time! I’m glad the President is finally coming to his senses to #EndTheShutdownNow!
It’s unconscionable that Senate Republicans are playing party politics while the well being and financial security of our federal employees hangs in the balance. It’s past time to #EndTheShutdown
Birmingham Mayor @randallwoodfin visited with me today! Thanks Mayor for hanging with my interns! @cityofbhamal
Secretary Ross, will you pay the interest on the payday loans that the working class often must turn to? As a billionaire, Sec. Ross clearly does not understand what it means to work paycheck to paycheck and the urgency of now. We need to
A big THANK YOU to members of my staff who are providing federal corrections officers in Aliceville lunch today!! Every little bit helps, but it’s important that we end this shutdown now so our federal workers get the pay they are due!
Democratic women of Ways and Means for the 116th Congress! #DiversityisOurStrength
I just voted for the 10th time to reopen government! It’s time for the Senate to pass one of our House-passed bills and #EndTheShutdown before our federal workers miss a second paycheck this Friday!
Birmingham Police Department Sergeant Wytasha Carter was a natural born leader who bravely put duty before self each and every day. May we live out Sergeant Carter’s legacy by working for a safer and more secure nation today and every day.
Over 800,000 Alabamians rely on SNAP benefits to feed their families. I’m back in Washington fighting to make sure Alabamians have the support they need to put food on the table. We need to #EndTheShutdownNow!
A reminder that our federal workers are not political pawns. They’re hurting, and they’re depending on the President and Congress to end this shutdown.
Day 32 of Govt Shutdown- the real heros are the Hardworking TSA workers like those at the Birmingham Airport who still offer a smile while they work to keep us safe. THANK YOU! #EndTheShutdownNow #EndTrumpShutdown
I’m working hard with my colleagues to re-open the government and ease the burden of the #TrumpShutdown. I co-sponsored the Shutdown Relief Act last week to allow federal workers impacted by the government shutdown to borrow money from their retirement plans without penalty.
Big Thank you to all the workers at @BHMAirport for all that you do!
Another heartbreaking example of the reach of this #TrumpShutdown. We all rely on the essential government services to stay safe – from the @NWS to @TSA. Our workers deserve better.
May we recommit ourselves to ideals of Dr. King as we continue to strive to create the ‘beloved community’! Serve others this MLK Day! #EndTheShutdownNow
Dr. King once said, “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” Here in Selma and across the country, federal workers are facing an injustice as a result of the government shutdown. We must re-open government NOW!
At the Selma MLK unity breakfast @SenDougJones, honoring the legacy and life of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  Headed to Montgomery Airport to feed the federal airport workers in memory of MLK.  May we all recommit ourselves to the vision and ideals of Dr. King. #MLKDay2019
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. set an example for American leadership, not just through his words, but through action. Today, let’s recommit ourselves to ensuring that his Dream becomes a reality.
The President’s most recent partisan proposal to re-open the government is a non-starter and cannot garner enough support to ensure our federal workers get they pay they’re due. It’s past time to put politics aside and end the shutdown now!
Proud to join my colleagues to fights for the rights of survivors  of human trafficking!
Pay checks, air safety, food stamps and border security are just a few of the things impacted by the #TrumpShutdown. Sen. McConnell and the president must pass one of our EIGHT House-passed bills to re-open the government.  Americans deserve better.
Glad to work with my House colleagues ⁦@RepAderholtNews⁩ and ⁦@RepMarthaRoby⁩ to get additional funding for Alabama farmers! 
I’m honored to serve with so many diverse, driven and passionate women this Congress. Keep an eye out for these New York Times covers today! (and skip to 0:19!!)
Happy Birthday to the brilliant @MichelleObama! Here’s to many more years of leadership and friendship �
Congratulations to R. B. Hudson Middle’s Corbyn Boyd and Trajon Thomas from Selma on their win in the 2018 Congressional App Challenge! Their app, “Snackable,” will help raise funds for school activities. Corbyn and Trajon are the first students from AL-07 to win the challenge!
In states that haven’t expanded Medicaid, premiums and health care costs are higher and rural hospital closures are far more common. So I introduced legislation w @MarcVeasey to incentivize the Gov. to expand Medicaid to approx. 314,000 more Alabamians.
Angie Ackley is a federal corrections officer from Aliceville who is one of hundreds of thousands of federal employees forced to work without pay or furloughed during this shutdown. She’s not sure if she can pay her mortgage if it continues. It’s time to #EndTheShutdown!
On the 25th day of the #TrumpShutdown I voted for the seventh time to reopen the government and ensure that over 800,000 federal workers receive their paychecks.
Today would've been Martin Luther King Jr.’s 90th birthday. I'm working tirelessly and leading the charge to empower all voters by passing the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which will restore the 1965 Voting Rights Act and help fulfill his dream of a more just and equal society.
I’ll be presiding over the House floor today in honor of the 111th Founder’s Day at 12:30pm CT! You can tune in here:  #AlphaKappaAlpha
Today I attended the homegoing of former Birmingham Mayor Larry Langford! It was a remembrance of an extraordinary life and legacy! I was honored to play a part of getting his release so that he could spend his final days surrounded family, and a community that loved him deeply!
Birmingham is better because of Sgt. Carter’s contributions.  May we live out his legacy by working for a more safe and secure Birmingham today and every day!
These words are as true today as they were in 2016: “Every day, you confront danger so it does not find our families, carry burdens so they do not fall to us, and courageously meet test after test to keep us safe.”
In 2016, President @BarackObama wrote a beautiful letter to our Nation’s police officers that I find relevant as we mourn the loss of Birmingham Police Sergeant Wytasha Carter. Find the letter here:
I am heartbroken this morning over the news that we’ve lost a Birmingham Police Sergeant who was killed while protecting our fellow citizens. Let’s pray for the police force and the family and loved one of the sergeant killed.
Today we celebrated the swearing-in of Dallas County Probate Judge, Jimmy Nunn.
What a historic day for @JeffCoSheriff. It brings me great joy to say congratulations to new sheriff, Mark Pettway, the first African American Sheriff of Jefferson County. I know you’re going to do great things! #BreakingBarriers
Today,  I also voted to provide back pay to federal workers that haven’t gotten paid in the new year! Shame on Trump for putting politics before the American people! #EndTheShutdown
Today I am voted to reopen the National Parks including the Selma Interpretative Center! The Trump shutdown must end! POTUS-Too many hardworking federal employees need their pay and taxpayers deserve to have our national treasures OPEN #EndtheTrumpShutdown
This is shameful. For every worker who has to dip into savings, darken the doors of a payday lender, or apply for unemployment, this is a dark day in this country and political games in Washington are to blame. #TrumpShutdown END
No wall, no matter how high or wide, will help that American worker get their finances back on track or help them run from the cycle of debt they've been trapped in. Thanks #TrumpShutdown!
The payday loan industry is having a field day with the #TrumpShutdown, taking advantage of people desperate for an infusion of cash to pay bills. We all know how that ends-endless cycles of debt for some, repossessed cars, financial ruin for others.
A wall will not pay them for the hours the #TrumpShutdown has taken from them or feed their families or buy their medicine in the meantime.
On top of missed paychecks for federal workers, there are also 1000s of hourly workers who work in the cafeterias or on the custodial staff at these agencies who will not get backpay. The #TrumpShutdown is leaving them even less economically secure.
What many in Washington don’t understand is that the average American can’t miss a paycheck without dipping in to savings. And for far too many, there are no savings to dip into or parent to ask for money from.
THREAD: From men and women of the Coast Guard working in Mobile, to National Park Service rangers in Selma to NASA workers and contractors in Huntsville, thousands of Alabama workers will go without paychecks today because of the #TrumpShutdown!
A National Championship Caucus wouldn't be much fun for anyone except @RepJeffDuncan and me. Clemson wins the championship this year, but they still have 14 more to win before they match our record! In the meantime, enjoy the Chick-Fil-A, Team Duncan. Y'all deserve it! #RollTide
Here in Birmingham, Mayor Langford will be remembered for his dedication to serving the community he grew up in and for his fight to bring greater opportunities to people in Jefferson County. He was a man of faith, and he put his faith into action. He will be deeply missed.
My heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Langford and the entire family on the passing of former Mayor Langford. May you find comfort that he died as he lived —with dignity, distinction and as a free man with family, friends and community who loved him deeply!
And who says there is no bipartisanship in Congress? ⁦@RepJeffDuncan⁩ and I agree that ⁦@ClemsonFB⁩ and ⁦@AlabamaFTBL⁩ are both great teams! Congrats again! #GoTigers #RollTide
Congratulation to the Clemson Tigers and  @RepJeffDuncan for a great game and outstanding season! Well earned Chick-fil-A! #NationalChampionship
Fired up and ready to go! Feeling victory tonight! #RollTideRoll #NationalChampionship
Throwback pic from 2016! I wouldn’t be so confident @RepJeffDuncan. You did look great in houndstooth! I got the hat and tie ready for you again my friend! @UofAlabama legends are made! #RollTide @AlabamaFTBL #NationalChampionship #WhereLegendsAreMade
RT @RepJeffDuncan: It’s on, @RepTerriSewell! I am predicting @ClemsonFB � on top when the clock runs out #ALLIN #GoTigers #NationalChampion…
Hey @RepJeffDuncan It’s Championship Game Day! Are you ready? Our friendly wager is on!! #RollTide #NationalChampions
Inspiring words from @RepJohnLewis here at the press conference to intro the #ForThePeople Act - “Our vote is the most powerful tool we have in a democratic society,” it’s our job to make sure everyone has fair access to the ballot box.
HISTORIC. Today we are introducing the For the People Act - a Bill which fights back against gerrymandering, big-money politics, and weak ethics laws. A bill which makes a commitment to #RestoreTheVOTE!! This is a big step towards building a government of, by, and for the people!
Who runs the World? GIRLS do!!! Democratic Women of the 116th Congress! #girlpower #BlackGirlMagic
