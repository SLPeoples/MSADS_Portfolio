@w8wutt @rockraider3 Yes, the emergency declaration redirects military funds that are only available for FY 2019.  Those funds stop flowing on September 30th and a new funding bill will be written that prevents the redirection of military funds.
Everyone knows the President will soon veto the resolution that would have voided his emergency declaration, but do they realize later this year, he will sign a massive FY 2020 omnibus/CR that specifically defunds his emergency declaration and doesn’t have much money for a wall?

The political brilliance of the emergency declaration is it absolves all of those who helped pass the spending bills without a wall. I voted against those bills and against Paul Ryan (architect), but I voted for a bill (never passed senate) that had full funding for the wall.

@JeremyChesser3 @realDonaldTrump Good idea but I don’t think Democrat leadership would go for that. Most of the Reps on the left side of the aisle never wanted to restrict Obama’s overreach, and they still don’t want to rein in the executive branch.  For most (but not all), this is only about President Trump.
There is a crisis at our border, but it’s not an emergency when Congress doesn’t spend money how the President wants. The President’s constitutional remedy is to veto spending bills that aren’t suitable to him, yet he has chosen to sign many bills that did not fund the wall.
The appropriations process belongs within Congress according to the Constitution. To the extent that Congress has in the past relinquished some of that authority broadly, it has done so recklessly.
In order to be consistent in preserving the constitutional structure of our Republic, I will be voting for the resolution to prevent the President from using a national emergency declaration to re-appropriate money for the wall.
I support President Trump and I support the wall. In fact I voted to fund the wall for the full amount requested by @realDonaldTrump. I also called out President Obama when he tried to use his pen and phone to sidestep Congress on immigration, war, healthcare, and gun control.

@tonybalogna An appropriation bill is law (voted on by both chambers and signed by potus), so it would override any law that precedes it.“Budget” is the language that Congress uses for the aspirational “resolution” that gives a big picture of the spending.  POTUS doesn’t sign them.
FY2019 appropriations that are being re-appropriated by the exec emergency to build wall will expire on 9/30/2019. Won’t Democrats write the FY2020 appropriation bill to forbid any of it from being repurposed for a wall? i.e. seems like this emergency doesn’t work for very long.

@Midwesterner196 @TerraMarQue @FreedomWorks The installed price of solar is about $2.50/watt.  The tariff amounts to 10 cents of that if the panel is coming from China.
@TerraMarQue @FreedomWorks Do you think the sponsors of the GND have the same sense and wherewithal?  We know they have the wherewithal because we know their salaries.  Why wouldn’t they use 100% solar at their homes?
@TowardATheory You’re basically saying people (including the ones I serve with) won’t do what they think is right unless the government forces them or takes from others and provides for them.

@ChuziChips You and I probably agree.  I don’t think we should tariff solar panels.  But you said “imagine” and I thought, “why imagine when we can calculate?” Turns out the tariffs on panels aren’t that significant, and frankly I’d prefer a flat tariff (on all things) to an income tax.

@TowardATheory Why don’t all the GND sponsors have solar panels on their homes?  Why not even half of them?  Why don’t at least a dozen of them have net zero homes? Maybe you believe but they don’t.
@ChuziChips We don’t have to imagine.  The solar tariffs add about 10 cents to the $2.50/ watt installed price of a setup with Chinese panels. (Not much). And all the panels in this picture were produced domestically (made in USA).
@Michele7216 @canderson93 The picture in the OP is my setup, making power today, yet I would never put my name to the ridiculous GND.
@eastriverrunner Mine does, but it’s not cheap and sometimes we have to live without air conditioning in the summer and bundle up inside in the winter.  I just don’t think these legislators have much of a clue about what they’re asking for, because they don’t even live it themselves.
@scottspjut Nice, I’m waiting to hear why those who make $174,000 per year, and have signed their names to the #GND, would be using coal and natural gas to power their homes when solar and wind solutions have been commercially available for a decade.
@TerraMarQue @FreedomWorks I would have YOU do what YOU think YOU should do and what YOU can afford to do, not what a bunch of hypocrites would force you to do.  Btw, those are my solar panels in the picture.  Took that picture today.
@j_desarno Great idea!  In fact, my car does run on coal when I’m not charging at home. #sassywithmassie
@an7361 @RightGlockMom Just going without air conditioning during cloudy weeks would be enough to make them check into a hotel. � Definitely there are major compromises for the whole family when going off the grid, even with a large system like we have (and some do it with a system 1/10th the size).
@cumberickman If I had a natural gas resource in my backyard, I’d frack that. The reality is everyone with a roof or yard has solar resource, yet only a few use it.  Have to ask why that is.
@CindiCooper1 I haven’t looked at the wind resource maps recently but I’d wager that solar is cheaper than wind in almost all of Eastern Ky.  Natural gas and coal have them both beat until a practical battery or other type of energy storage is available.
About this #GreenNewDeal, if I like the solar panels I have, can I keep them? �‍️ How much more will they cost when the #GND makes them free? �
@RightGlockMom We have ~20 chickens � and 7 ducks � . Overwintering several dual purpose breeds so we can raise meat chickens ducks this spring but they lay a lot of eggs� too!
Solar wind aren’t cheap, but every congressman makes $174,000/year. If solar wind are really the answers, why don’t the sponsors of the #greennewdeal power their own homes entirely with it? Maybe they’re waiting for you to pay for theirs, or maybe they don’t really believe.

Natural gas in well water was not uncommon pre-fracking. Also, well diggers have died from exposure to gas in hand dug wells.  Ponds release the gas constantly from anaerobic digestion. Termites turn wood to natural gas. Millions of buffalo did too... before man killed them.
