Proud to help pass #HR1, the For The People Act today. This legislation is a strong statement about our values as a Congress – that we want to clean up our government by restoring transparency and accountability and fix our elections so they work for our constituents.
In the 21st century, access to a free and open internet isn’t a privilege, it’s a right. It’s time to give power back to the people – it’s time to #SaveTheNet. Proud to be a cosponsors of the Save the Internet Act, which restores critical net neutrality provisions.
We must find a way to lower out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs that promotes transparency, increases competition and ensures our constituents have access to needed medicines. Watch my discussion in today’s @WaysMeansCmte Health Subcommittee.

Finally. Finally, we have done more than thoughts and prayers. Finally, we have taken a vote on #HR8, my bipartisan bill to expand background checks and help save lives.
“I won’t quit working on background checks. This is the one we have to do — this is the one we’ve got to get over the finish line.” Check out @TalKopan’s story in @sfchronicle on our journey to pass #HR8 how I'll keep working to prevent gun violence.

Thank you to my former Republican colleagues for your outspoken support of #HR8. Click to read their argument for why Republicans must support my bill to expand background checks.
"It's also an opportunity for Republicans to show, through our actions, that our priority is to govern and get things done. But perhaps most important, it's an opportunity to do the right thing and be on the right side of history."
This is despicable and dangerous rhetoric. This week, Congress is taking action to keep our communities safe from gun violence, no matter what hateful acts of incitement we get from opponents.
