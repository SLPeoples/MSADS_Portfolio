Loudon County constituents who need federal agency assistance or want to pass along opinions are encouraged to stop by the Philadelphia Library today until 2. My staff are set up and ready to help.
My predecessor, Congressman Duncan, originally filed this bill, and I think it’s an excellent piece of legislation that deserves bipartisan support. (3/3)
It’s not fair that when a company files for bankruptcy the big shots and insiders who caused the problem are able to receive huge bonuses while workers face layoffs. (2/3)
Proud to be an original cosponsor of the No Bonuses in Bankruptcy Act of 2019, which was introduced today and seeks to prevent companies that file for bankruptcy from rewarding highly paid employees and company insiders with fiscally irresponsible bonuses. (1/3)
Thanks to everyone who came out and took advantage of today’s Mobile Office Hours at the Dandridge Memorial Library. Next up, my local team will be in Philadelphia this Thursday (3/7) from 10-2 at the library.

Earlier this week, I gave a floor speech in honor of political cartoonist Charlie Daniel. I've been made fun of by people all over the world but Charlie is my favorite. I know I speak for many in East Tenn when I say the paper isn't the same without him.
I simply cannot support a bill that spends this much money without having the chance to figure out what is in it, and I’m definitely not going to support it if fails to secure our borders but funds parties and other pork. Read my entire statement at

No one in TVA's service area, especially those in Roane County, caused this problem and it adds insult to injury expecting the citizens to account for someone else’s liability. These folks shouldn’t be expected to pay for it, that responsibility falls on the contractor.
Joined @RepCohen today in demanding answers about TVA’s announcement that ratepayers might have to pay for the misdeeds of the contractor it used for cleanup work following the Kingston coal ash spill.
Appreciate the leadership of @RepAnnWagner and @SteveScalise on this important legislation, and I'm proud to support it.

Both in the state legislature and as mayor I focused on increasing openness and transparency in government, and this bill continues those efforts at the federal level.

.@SpeakerPelosi brings another kick-the-can funding bill to the floor instead of actually negotiating with House Republicans, @realDonaldTrump and the Senate. She doesn’t want the shutdown to end, that much is clear. It’s time for Democrats to come to the table and compromise.
Just to be clear: I voted FOR the resolution AGAINST white nationalism.
I am honored that the family of Pierce Corcoran invited me to join them outside the Capitol today to stand up for border security. His death could have been avoided. Members of the House and Senate must be willing to put national security ahead of party politics.
