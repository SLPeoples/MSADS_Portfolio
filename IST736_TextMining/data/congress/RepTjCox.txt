Great meeting with @NTEUnews earlier today. I’m committed to fighting for our public servants - politicians have vilified them for political gain for too long
This bill will hold our politicians accountable to the people once again. I want to thank the people of the Central Valley for making their voices heard and pushing our elected representatives to finally do right by them. 5/5
Today‘s legislation is the first step towards bringing the voices and the priorities of the people back to Congress. I’m proud to have voted today for #HR1, the #ForThePeopleAct 4/
This is why we are behind in the fight for renewable, sustainable technologies of the future. This is why many in the Central Valley still lack clean drinking water, and why our children breathe poisonous air. 3/
Our pay-to-play politics is why today we pay an unbelievable premium for prescription drugs. This is why we cannot, as the wealthiest nation in the world, deliver quality, affordable healthcare to every American family. 2/

@RepJimCosta @SenFeinstein The Bureau’s announcement yesterday was a significant move in the right direction, but still insufficient for the needs of our communities and farmers. I'll keep fighting to ensure that they get the resources to do their jobs and plan for the future.
We need infrastructure that connects us to Northern and Southern California to grow and prosper. But as costs have skyrocketed out of control, our leaders in Sacramento from both parties have failed to provide needed

Actual national emergencies that need our attention NOW:�22 veteran suicides a day�Climate change �130 deaths from the opioid epidemic every day�Lack of clean drinking water in underserved communities
This American people have made clear that they want us focused on lowering the cost of healthcare, growing middle class wages, and fighting the influence of special interests in Washington. I remain focused on delivering on these priorities for #CA21.
I’ve repeatedly laid out my support for more judges to clear the backlog of immigration cases, more funding to give our law enforcement the tools they need to keep our border secure, and ensuring we lock down our ports of entry, where the majority of drugs come into the US.
But the President overstepped his constitutional authority to declare he will divert scarce taxpayer dollars to a project we all know is unnecessary and ineffective.
President Trump’s emergency declaration to sidestep the Constitution is short-sighted, irresponsible, and lawless. Our Founding Fathers constructed a system of checks and balances to protect the people from executive overreach.
Points were made
