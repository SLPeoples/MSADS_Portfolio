I spoke with @MelissaAFrancis @AftertheBell said we should never have to "give up" something in order to secure our nation. This is about finding the right balance of tools and solutions for border patrol to carry out their mission.
As a member of the bipartisan conference committee on border security, I’m negotiating to find a solution that works for U.S. - that includes a wall and giving our brave border patrol officers the resources they need. I’m optimistic will keep fighting to secure the homeland.
About to join @MelissaAFrancis @AftertheBell to talk about the border security conference committee. Tune in now!
Congratulations Chairman Poole!
I’m not sure how Democrats could come to any other conclusion after hearing from the experts yesterday. Listen and learn more here:
Joined @kilmeade this am to share an update on the conference committee on border security where our negotiations stand. My goal is ending the humanitarian security crisis. This includes a wall.
Last night, @POTUS again made a strong case for ending the crisis at the border based on facts, evidence and expert advice. Read more about my response to the State of the Union here:

Kudos to ATL @tsa. Longer lines than normal @atlairport but tsa did a great job moving everyone through w/ a smile southern hospitality. 25 mins from beginning to end.
The 116th Congress continues under a cloud of a partial government shutdown it's for one reason and one reason only: Democrats continue to put their political agenda ahead of the security of our country. Watch my speech on the #HouseFloor:
To the brave men and women who go above and beyond every single day to protect our communities, we are truly grateful for your service. Thank you!
The prosperity security of the nation are taking a back seat to the Democrat’s political agenda. Last night I urged them to set aside politics come to the table. Working together we can fund the wall reopen the government. Watch here:
GA families are experiencing a booming economy I will do everything in my power to protect build on that success. Democrats want us all to feel gloom doom. But their message is outshined by the reality of lower taxes more jobs. 4/4
House Democrats have also promised to pass burdensome new regulations, repeal @POTUS tax cuts slash military funding. I’ll fight their efforts every step of the way. 3/
This is normal necessary. Not normal is the level of anti-Trump hysteria on the left. The first order of business in the new Congress should be to secure the border open the govt. @POTUS is willing to strike a deal, he just needs Dems to put our country before politics. 2/
Unfortunately, the #116thCongress begins under the cloud of a partial government shutdown. The prosperity security of the nation are taking a back seat to the Democratic Party’s political agenda. @POTUS is asking for modest and reasonable funding to secure the border 1/
I’m honored to continue serving Northwest Georgia in the House of Representatives at this critical moment. #gapol #116thCongress

Georgia’s number 1 industry is agribusiness, which contributes $73+ billion to our state’s economy. Today the House voted to send the #FarmBill to @POTUS desk. It strengthens the programs that protect support the Georgians who work hard every day to put food on our tables.
This day marks the attack on #PearlHarbor and the lives that were lost 77 years ago. We will never forget those who so bravely defended our freedom.
President George H. W. Bush dedicated his life to serving our country. From Naval pilot to CIA Director to the White House, he served our nation honorably and fought for his beliefs. The Bush family is in my thoughts and prayers.
Happy #Thanksgiving! Wishing you and your loved ones a wonderful day!
