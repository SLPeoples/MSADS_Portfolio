This unconstitutional power grab will federalize the election system and is an attempt to take away each state’s constitutional right to determine their own election process. H.R. 1 politicizes and undermines our election process to serve Speaker Pelosi the Democratic majority.
Some experts are still perplexed that in 2 years, @realDonaldTrump Republicans have replaced Obama era stagnation w/ a dynamic economy that is creating opportunities for all Americans! But it’s pretty simple- lower taxes, less regulation, and less government = more opportunity!
.@realDonaldTrump loves #SouthCarolina and we have a great relationship with his Administration! @henrymcmaster's decision to establish this office will help us continue to fight for your priorities in Washington to move our nation and state
With drugs pouring across the border, dangerous cartels using children to manipulate the system, and STILL no mandatory e-verify, even the mainstream media can’t deny that the crisis at our southern border has reached a breaking

Meanwhile, I’m hearing from South Carolina farmers who are worried about going out of business and families who need certainty and support. My constituents have suffered enough and shouldn’t have to wait any longer.
Americans impacted by last year’s natural disasters are being used as pawns. House leadership has held disaster funding hostage in the last two spending bills. It is unacceptable to put the millions of Americans struggling after last year’s natural disasters on the back burner.
H.R. 8 takes no steps to prevent criminals from acquiring firearms yet criminalizes law-abiding gun owners trying to protect themselves and their families.
Dem extremism was on full display last night. Many Dems opposed a measure that would notify ICE when an illegal immigrant tries to buy a gun threw their support behind a gun control bill that undermines the 2A.

If you take one thing away from this: if you're trying to figure out how much $$ you saved on taxes this year, compare your tax liability year over year, not the size of your refund!
If you like ice-cream ice-cream puns), and have questions about your tax refund vs. your tax liability, this video is for
The size of your refund doesn't tell you if your tax bill was higher or lower. A smaller refund means you kept more of YOUR money that you worked for every pay-period instead of sending it up to bureaucrats in Washington.
Some of my friends across the aisle are missing the mark when it comes to tax reform refunds. Let's clear this up. Your tax refund reflects how much you overpaid in taxes during the year. It's not a bonus check, it's a return of the money you loaned to the gov interest-free.
I voted no on tonight’s spending bill that did not provide adequate resources for border security or address disaster relief. Full statement️
With the left's increasingly radical stance on abortion, it is more important than ever that we stand up for life and protect the unborn. I am proud to support the effort to exclude abortion providers from Medicaid in South Carolina.
"GDP is great, unemployment is at an all-time low, African Americans are doing well, Hispanics are doing well, wages are rising at the fastest pace in ten years, blah, blah, blah."And I guess the extra money in their constituents' pockets thanks to tax reform is just crumbs!
American opportunity has been restored thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct and @realDonaldTrump! Watch more:

I wanted to take away the guessing and provide people with a degree of certainty during an otherwise uncertain time. The 2018 Natural Disasters Tax Relief Act creates an automatic 60-day tax deadline extension after a Presidentially Declared Disaster.
Hurricane Matthew made landfall in South Carolina just a few days before a tax filing deadline. Hurricane Florence hit us in the middle of a tax filing season. My constituents have had to deal with this uncertainty more than once.
Can you imagine worrying about a tax deadline when you don’t know how a natural disaster will impact your home, your family, and your community?
Unbelievable that Dems would shut down the government again to release criminals into our community, handicapping law enforcement endangering their own constituents. They're out of touch with South Carolina. They're out of touch with America.
"Over 90% of ICE's arrests are aliens who have a criminal conviction, have been arrested for a criminal offense, or have been previously removed."
Note: "Approximately 72% of ICE's current detention population is subject to mandatory detention due to the alien having certain convictions or having committed certain acts."
That's right- they are demanding a random limit on how many illegal immigrants can be held by the federal government. Anyone over this cap, even those with criminal records, would be released into our communities.
I didn't think Dems could get more extreme, but I was wrong. Their latest demand in border security negotiations? An arbitrary cap on the number of beds in immigration detention centers.
In their zeal to attack this President, Democrats are weaponizing the IRS, just like they've weaponized the FBI and DOJ. I won't stand by while they hold sham hearings to score political points.Watch more:
� FACT CHECK� : There is NO law that requires the president to disclose his tax returns.... but Democrats want you to believe there is. Saying President Trump isn't complying with the law is an abject falsehood.

The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would ensure any infant born alive after an abortion receives the same level of care as other newborns. We are in the process of collecting signatures to force Speaker Pelosi to bring this bill to the floor for a vote.
I cannot believe this would be celebrated in the United States. It is unconscionable. In the State of the Union, President Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to ban the late-term abortion of babies who can feel pain in the womb. We’re already getting to work.
In NY, they actually lit up the One World Trade Center to “CELEBRATE” the passage of a bill that allows abortions to be performed right up to the moment of birth. In VA, the gov advocated for a bill that allows abortion to be performed when the mother is “about to give birth."
I give @POTUS an A+ on last night’s State of the Union. It was interesting to me that Democrats didn’t express support for economic growth, record low minority unemployment, and a renewed resolve against socialism at last night’s #SOTU.
Democrats' refusal to secure our border is out of step with America and certainly out of step with South Carolina!
Hopefully Democrats will answer President Trump's call to reject the politics of resistance so that we can continue to uplift all Americans.
It's just plain sad that Democrats won't join us in celebrating the successes our constituents are sharing or rise in support of the American values and freedoms we hold dear.
President Trump announced that we have achieved the lowest minority unemployment in decades. Radio silence from the Democrats. He renewed our resolve against socialism. We saw scowls across the aisle!
.@POTUS's call for unity in last night's #SOTU was inspiring and uplifting, but unfortunately many Democrats refused to recognize our achievements or express support for policies that will move our country forward.

Although I'm glad that government employees will receive temporary relief, this effort will be in vain unless at the end of these three weeks we come to an agreement to fully fund border security, provide disaster relief, and reopen the government for the entire fiscal year.
Democrats are three for three on not paying furloughed government employees during the shutdown. It's past time for Speaker Pelosi to come to the negotiating table so that we can secure the border, pay federal workers, and end the shutdown.
It's a tall task, but I have faith that this collaborative effort will yield real results for those most vulnerable to flooding in #SC07.
The purpose of the Commission is to find innovative solutions to mitigate flooding in South Carolina. Gov. McMaster called on experts from all sectors industries across the state to find ways to mitigate, prepare, protect SC against future flooding.

Instead of offering the same doomed bill 11 times, Speaker Pelosi should come to the negotiating table. President Trump put forward a good faith proposal rooted in bipartisanship. While it certainly isn't exactly what I wanted or what Mrs. Pelosi wanted, it is a starting point.
Instead of participating in meaningful negotiations, Speaker Pelosi wasted time bringing the same sham bill that includes $0 for border security to the House floor. It's time for her to work with the President instead of against the American people. Enough is Enough.
Today, @HouseGOP voted to pay federal employees while we work to reopen the government and secure our border. Before deciding to go home early for the weekend, 215 Democrats voted to deprive federal workers of their pay.
Democratic leadership should spend less time working against President Trump and more time working across the aisle to address the crisis at our southern border and reopen the government.
WATCH: "A bus in Mexico drops off dozens of migrants and then they simply walk across a stretch of the Arizona border." Apparently Democrats see nothing wrong with unchecked, uncontrolled illegal immigration into this country. They continue to complain, but refuse to negotiate.

Watch my full speech:
This is a political game to them- and they're playing to win. But they're playing with the lives of people in South Carolina who are hurting and need our help. It's time Democrats come to the table to provide disaster relief, secure our border, and reopen the government.
Democrats they made the disaster relief bill subject to opening the govt. w/o border security by adding a CR to the bill at the last minute. The added CR was a poison pill that ensured that an otherwise legitimate, bipartisan bill won't be considered by the Senate or @POTUS.
I even offered an amendment to this bill that would have streamlined the rebuilding process and helped people get back into their homes as quickly as possible.
Democrats' shutdown tactics reached a new low today. The House considered a bill that would have provided disaster relief funding for South Carolina, and surely would have been signed into law once the Democrats decided to stop with their games and reopen the government.

Meanwhile, President Trump and @HouseGOP have been ready to discuss ways to pass a comprehensive border security strategy that will give our Border Patrol Officers the resources they need to protect American citizens from the scourges coming across our border.
Update --&gt;Unfortunately, we saw more of the same from Democrats this week. Instead of seriously coming to the negotiating table, (Speaker Pelosi offered President Trump $1 for a border wall), House Dems brought forward spending bills that included 0 funding for border security.
Thank you, @MBPDSC Patrolman McMahon, for your years of service in our community and for keeping Myrtle Beach High School students safe! Enjoy your retirement!
I agree. Action needs to be taken to save lives in #SC07 and across the nation. We need to cut off the source of these drugs. We need to #SecureOurBorder.

2. Democrats have voted for wall funding in the past and have gone on the record about how illegal immigration and open borders are harmful to our country. They are only opposing increased border security because they dislike President Trump and do not want to see him succeed.

Democrats have said time and again that they are for “border security.” They should prove it by supporting a bill that will help secure our border, provide critical disaster relief funding, and keep our government open.
The border wall will help stop the flow of illegal immigration that is hurting the economy endangering communities across the country. This funding bill reflects the priorities of not only #SC07, but the entire country.
Securing our border is a matter of national security and a matter of life and death in the Seventh District. Law enforcement officers have attributed the 150 opioid overdoses in our district last year to drugs coming across our porous borders.
Many of my constituents are still recovering from Hurricane Florence and this funding is critical to helping the Seventh District rebuild. I will continue to assess the unmet needs of our district and ensure we have the resources for a complete recovery.
The House just advanced a spending bill that includes $7.8 billion for disaster relief and $5.7 billion to secure our border.
Democrats claim to support border security, but it's just not true. Illegal immigration hurts our economy and the drugs flowing across our porous border are endangering communities across the country. Enough is enough.
Read the full release:
The House just passed a tax package that will build on the economic momentum that is creating new opportunities and lifting people up in #SC07 across the country. It includes three of my bills that provide relief for disaster victims and modernize technology at the IRS.

The Farm Bill is a critical component of disaster recovery and will provide stability as our farmers continue to work, grow, and produce despite tough circumstance and unforeseen challenges.
#SC07 farmers have dealt with more than their fair share of devastation, having to overcome 3 hurricanes in the last 4 years. After Florence, I joined farmers in our district to survey crop damage saw first-hand the additional challenges they face after a catastrophic event.
Great news for South Carolina farmers, the #FarmBill is on the way to @POTUS’s desk! This legislation strengthens the farm safety net by expanding crop insurance, providing certainty for producers in the face of dropping farm income natural disasters.
Great to see the Grand Strand continuing to grow and expand to new markets! Now, we are working on infrastructure to keep up with this growth and bring opportunity to all of
The straightforward approach suggested by the Trump Administration will provide much needed certainty, return authority to state and local entities, and promote responsible management of our nation’s water and land in accordance with the Clean Water Act.
Farmers were no longer able to plow their own land or became tied up in jurisdiction disputes that took years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to resolve - it was the predictable result of such a massive government overreach.
It was a power grab of epic proportions that subjected South Carolina farmers, landowners, and small businesses to onerous rules costly requirements. At the time, I heard concerns of many constituents whose fears turned into reality across the country.
The @EPA and @USACEHQ proposed #WOTUS definition is welcome news in #SC07! President Obama's regulatory-happy EPA expanded the federal govt's regulatory authority from "main waterways" to all bodies of water, even on private property.
I would like to thank Governor McMaster for his lifesaving actions during the storm and his commitment to the people of South Carolina during the recovery process. We will continue to work together to ensure a strong, complete recovery for our constituents.
Additionally, I am glad the Governor has asked the South Carolina delegation to find a way to fund I-73 as an emergency evacuation route. Improving our outdated infrastructure is critical to enhancing our disaster preparedness.
In #SC07, we are facing a long and costly recovery from Hurricane Florence. Governor McMaster’s request for additional CDBG-DR funding will ensure we can help as many people rebuild as possible.

Just as American families and businesses must operate under a budget, so should elected officials and the federal government.
The federal budget deficit is now almost $800 billion and today's bad choices will fall onto the backs of the next generation. Reducing each Member's Representational Allowance by 5% is a doable way to save millions of taxpayer dollars.
