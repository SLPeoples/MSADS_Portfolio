Aurora, IL Chief of Police Kristen Ziman is a pillar of the #IL14 community. Her strength and her service to our community makes us so proud! I was honored to speak about her service on the House floor yesterday for #InternationWomensDay.

#IL14 relies on #NetNeutrality every day to work, run small businesses, and stay connected with friends family. In the 21st century, access to a free and open internet isn’t just a privilege, it’s a right. It’s time to #SaveTheNet
H.R. 1 will bring sweeping reform to the way our government is run by bringing the power back to the people. It’s time to create fair elections, reduce corruption in politics, and ensure the voices of the American people are heard. #ForThePeople
I am lucky to be surrounded by so many women who inspire me every day, not only within the halls of Congress, but back home in the 14th District. Your stories and triumphs continue to motive me to make a difference every day. Happy #InternationalWomensDay!

Joining @Morning_Joe soon to discuss yesterday’s @HomelandDems hearing with DHS Sec. Nielsen. Tune in on @MSNBC now!
I will continue to hold @DHSgov and @SecNielsen accountable for the impacts their policies have on the lives of thousands of children and families seeking to come to the US.
As a nurse, I’m concerned about the trauma young children and families are experiencing as a result of DHS separating families at the border. Tearing kids away from their parents is unacceptable, immoral, and just plain wrong.

Looking forward to the opportunity to demand answers from DHS Sec. Kirstjen Nielsen today in the Homeland Security Committee @HomelandDems hearing.

It’s important that Congress works to help ensure everyone has a safe respectable work environment. Proud to join colleagues including @SenKamalaHarris, @lisamurkowski, @RepLoisFrankel in its introduction to help #IL14 workers. #EmpowerAct
The #EmpowerAct is an important first step to end the culture of silence around workplace harassment. This bill will limit the use of mandatory non-disclosure agreeements employers use to prevent victims from speaking up require companies to report information on harassment.

For centuries, women have been at the front lines of the fight for progress. We fight not only for women’s rights, but for the rights for all. This #WomensHistoryMonth join me in celebrating women like Angela Davis, Diane Nash, Sojourner Truth who paved the way for all of us.

I was appointed to the Education and Labor Committee—and I want your input on some of the most important issues affecting #IL14. I’m setting up advisory councils to bring your voices and ideas to Congress.
Last week, I voted in support of #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. I refuse to accept the frequency of these preventable tragedies and am committed to honoring the lives of those who we have lost to gun violence with action.
Today on the floor I spoke on why I will support the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 and it was amazing to look up to the gallery and see a sea of moms in red! Thanks @MomsDemand for being such champions of gun safety and thanks @ShannonRWatts for your leadership! #HR8
We can’t afford efforts to make gun violence prevention a partisan issue. Americans demand action to #EndGunViolence. We must make the Bipartisan Background Checks Act law.

Tonight we will honor the victims of the shooting at Henry Pratt in Aurora with a moment of silence on the floor of the House of Representatives. After, I will give a speech pledging to honor the lives of Russell, Clayton, Josh, Trevor, and Vicente with action.
Worse yet, this will jeopardize access to basic health care like contraception and cancer screenings. It’s alarming and it’s wrong.
The Administration just made an unprecedented restriction on our ability to do so by cutting funding for providers who inform patients of all of their healthcare options.
As a nurse, I know firsthand how important it is that healthcare providers empower women with all relevant health care information.

We will never forget Russell, Clayton, Josh, Trevor, and Vicente. And we will never forget the bravery of law enforcement and first responders who rushed toward the violence and undoubtedly saved countless lives. May our community come back stronger and safer than ever before.
We remember Vicente Juárez.El patriarca de una familia grande y muy unida, Vicente era un gran esposo, padre y abuelo de ocho nietos. Sus vecinos lo amaban por sus esfuerzos para eliminar el vecindario de dientes de león cada verano—algunos años con más éxito que otros.
We remember Trevor Wehner. A college student at Northern Illinois University killed on the very first day of his internship. He was described by a friend as someone who would go out of his way for others.
We remember Josh Pinkard. “I want to shout from the rooftops about how amazing Josh was!” his wife wrote this past weekend about a man who loved God, family, and college football.
We remember Clayton Parks. A Northern Illinois University grad who his wife described as an incredible father to their young son.
We remember Russell Beyer. Proud chair of his union and a 20-year employee of Henry Pratt, Russell was a father of two and a steadfast Patriots fan.
It’s been a week since five people were killed in an act of gun violence in #Aurora. Seven days of shock. Seven days of mourning. And seven days of incredible strength by the families and our resilient community.
Closely monitoring the horrifying news in #Aurora and am on my way home to be with neighbors. Too soon to know the full details of what has happened, but what I do know is Aurora is a strong community and we will get through this together. Thanks to first responders on the scene.
It also included investments to make sure everyone is counted in the census, fund new infrastructure, address the opioid crisis, and protect clean water and air.
The bill we sent to the President includes over $1 billion for border security, and resources for more humane immigration system including enhanced medical support and family case management.
I support the agreement my colleagues reached to #KeepGovernmentOpen for American families and I hope the President will support this bipartisan, bicameral compromise too.
Roses are red.Violets are blue.We’re having some town halls...CAN’T WAIT TO SEE YOU! �
It’s been 11 years since the shooting at NIU. Since then we’ve seen gun violence in elementary schools, concerts, churches, Parkland one year ago on the same day. Enough. I came to Congress to act. That starts with #HR8. Everyone who buys a gun needs a background check.

The GOP tax law's limitation of the SALT deduction is not only causing our neighbors’ tax bills to skyrocket, but it could hurt our public schools. Our tax $ should go to our children’s schools, not to tax cuts for corporations.
Thanks @google for a great night last night with @RepLucyMcBath and so many friends who share the same goal: more African American women in leadership. #CBCWomen

Just wrapped our first #IL14 office hours... stayed for three hours, chatted with everyone who showed up, and I’m so grateful to hear from YOU! More events are in the works, can’t wait ��
One of my priorities in these first few weeks in Congress is connecting with state legislators across #IL14. Thank you ⁦@mbatinick⁩ ⁦@RitaMayfield⁩ ⁦@RepKifowit⁩ ⁦@SenatorHolmes⁩, excited to work together!
Chatted with ⁦@RepSchneider⁩, local mayors, and state legislators this morning in Round Lake Beach. Looking forward to working together to sustain growth and opportunity across Lake County. Thank you ⁦@LCMLeague⁩ for the invitation to offer a congressional update.
I’m holding office hours to hear from you! If you live in #IL14, stop by Marengo City Hall on Saturday from 3-4:30. No appointment needed, I’ll meet with anyone who wants to chat on a first-come, first-served basis. Many more to come, in all corners of our #IL14 community!
Today in @EdLaborCmte, Republicans talked about their commitment to people w/ pre-existing conditions. Hard to believe after 70+ votes to strip the #ACA of those protections. If they mean what they say I look forward to them joining my legislation to ban junk plans!

I’ll join anyone to help make quality healthcare more affordable, to improve our nation’s infrastructure, and to alleviate new and unfair tax burdens placed upon Illinoisians and I hope Republicans in Congress and the President come to the table with me in those efforts.
But, Illinoisians don’t need their elected officials dug-in on partisan positions or practicing unreasonable negotiating tactics like shutting down the government. They need us to get to work and work together.
Tonight was a unique opportunity to discuss how we can make progress on issues and move our country forward, and I was pleased to hear the President mention important things we need to get done for the American people like paid family leave.

She is such a good reminder that our country is a better place when we all are doing our part to spread kindness and make positive change in our communities.

This week I was selected to serve on the Disability Assistance Memorial Affairs subcommittee of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee (@VetAffairsDems). Excited to get to work to ensure veterans get the health benefits they deserve after putting their lives on the line.
The Rebuild America’s School Act helps not only our students, but also our economy. By investing more than $100 billion in school infrastructure, this bill would create 1.9 million good-paying jobs for local workers. #RebuildAmericasSchools
Every student, regardless of their family’s wealth, should have access to a safe, welcoming, and high-quality public school. That’s why I’m co-sponsoring the Rebuild America’s Schools Act. #RebuildAmericasSchools
When it comes to men and women: same work, same pay. Period. Proud that every member of the Democratic Caucus has signed on to the Paycheck Fairness Act.
Women still only make about 80 cents every $1 earned by a man. That gap is even wider for women of color. Compared to white men, African American women are paid 61 cents, Latina Women are paid 53 cents, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women are paid 62 cents.
Today I stood tall with many Democratic women to support #PaycheckFairness and I’m proud that every single member of our caucus has signed on to the Paycheck Fairness Act for #EqualPay.
I've heard from families across #IL14 that they're feeling the burden of the state and local tax deduction changes in the Republican Tax Bill. @RepCasten and I are working to get answers from the IRS.
Nonpartisan @USCBO says the GOP shutdown cost us $3 billion in economic activity that can’t be recovered. THREE BILLION DOLLARS over partisan politics. Let’s hope this report marks the end of senseless shutdowns hurting American workers families as a negotiating tactic.

Tonight, I also voted to fund the Small Business Administration. Our local small businesses and entrepreneurs have been some of the hardest hit during the government shutdown...access to capital is down $90 million per day! Looking to the Senate to pass this funding bill now.
Once again, tonight I voted to re-open the Treasury Dept and IRS so that we can meet the needs of the American people. So critical that folks across #IL14 can get their tax refunds without delay! The Senate needs to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor for a vote now.
Gave my first floor speech this afternoon on the urgent need to protect healthcare for families across Northern Illinois
