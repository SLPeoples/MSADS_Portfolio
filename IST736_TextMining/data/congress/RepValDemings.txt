After passage, it will go to the GOP-controlled Senate. For it to get a vote instead of being filed away, the American people will need to #SpeakUp and #SpeakOut in defense of our democracy. Government MUST work #ForThePeople. Let's pass #HR1.
#HR1, The #ForThePeople Act will dismantle discriminatory barriers to voting, purge our political system of big money, strengthen election infrastructure against foreign attack, and create new #ethics laws to begin dismantling a #CultureOfCorruption in Washington.
Today we will begin to restore the voices of the American people.In under an hour, we will pass the most significant government ethics reforms since Watergate, alongside new rules to empower the voices of everyday Americans and get big money out of politics. #HR1 #ForThePeople
Above all else, our justice system must be just. This year we passed the First Step Act to begin disassembling the unjust double standards which benefit the wealthy and well-connected and leave others behind.The Manafort sentence shows we still have a long way to go.
To reduce the cost of healthcare, create good jobs, or prevent gun violence, the first step is to get big money out of politics.#HR1 is the most significant ethics reform since Watergate. It's time to restore government #ForThePeople to D.C. and end the #CultureOfCorruption.
It doesn't take an experienced investigator to figure out why the GOP opposes new ethics rules and getting big money out of politics. #HR1 #CultureOfCorruption
#VAWA4All will help combat stalking and cyber-bullying. It will close loopholes that let stalkers buy guns. It will connect survivors with mental health services. Our communities are relying on us to help keep them safe. I’m proud to support the lifesaving, life changing #VAWA.
Here are some numbers.#VAWA has helped train 11,519 sexual assault nurse and forensic examiners, 89,937 law enforcement officers, and 18,404 court personnel.#VAWA has provided legal services for nearly 5,000 victims each month.The expanded #VAWA19 will do even more.
Every American has the right to be safe from domestic and sexual violence, yet Congress allowed the Violence Against Women Act to expire.It’s time to right that wrong and empower communities and survivors like never before. It’s time to reauthorize #VAWA. #VAWA4ALL #VAWA19

Secretary Nielsen couldn’t answer questions about injured officers, whether asylum laws are being followed correctly, how many children are imprisoned by the administration, or the traumatic impact of child separation. Or maybe she knew there was no defense for the indefensible.
I was also deeply disappointed that Secretary Nielsen was not able to answer my simple question about how many of her officers had been seriously injured on her watch—despite the fact that I have asked about this before. She’s supposed to be their advocate and representative.
The President’s fake “state of emergency” doesn’t come close to the national crisis that is gun violence. As Secretary Nielsen showed today, it also falls apart under the slightest questioning. A shameful abuse of power by this president.

In @HouseJudiciary I asked Mr. Whitaker under oath if he spoke to President Trump about the SDNY's case involving Michael Cohen. He refused to answer. It has been reported that they did in fact discuss the investigation. I hope that Matthew Whitaker will clarify his testimony.
Wrote one internment camp detainee,“I believe in this nation'sinstitutions, ideals and traditions.I glory in her heritage.I boast of her history.I trust in her future.”So do I. But only if we learn from the mistakes of the past can we create a future for all of us.
