A legislative giant and an American hero, Congressman Ralph Hall will be greatly missed by all who knew him. I had the privilege of knowing Congressman Hall, who also represented a portion of Collin County in Congress, and know our loss is heaven’s gain today.
Stepped out of committee to greet the Novacovich family from North Dallas. Thanks for visiting!
Discussed the need for more Collin County VA Clinics with VFW Post 8273 Commander Jason Harmon and Quartermaster Dr. Preston Rich from Frisco. These great Texans continue to help their fellow veterans through their work with @VFWHQ.
Wrapped up #ReadAcrossAmerica Week reading “House Mouse, Senate Mouse” with first graders from Ashley Elementary School in Frisco. Across the nation, teachers, librarians, and parents are bringing excitement to children through books! �
Great turnout at my IRS Free File Event at Collin College today! Thanks to Intuit Financial Freedom Foundation, AARP Tax Aides, CCIA, Foundation Communities, and the IRS for participating!
The work doesn’t end when the House is out of session. Some bipartisan problem solving from 30,000 feet with @RepColinAllred. ️
Some Collin County taxpayers may qualify for free filing services this tax season. Don't forget to RSVP for my IRS Free File Workshop taking place at 10:00 AM tomorrow at Collin College Spring Creek Campus. RSVP:
What an honor it is to call TX-03 students and let them know about their appointment to U.S. Military Service Academies. I just notified a Murphy student that they have been accepted into the United States Naval Academy!

Incredibly grateful for the opportunity to have met w/ so many constituents from Allen, Plano, Prosper today. My biggest take away from the events? ️ By working together we can solve the issues facing our nation.Sign up to attend a future event:
There’s no better way to start a Thursday than joining constituents in Allen for coffee and conversation. ️
Thank you @CollinCoSO for all you do for our community.
After receiving letters from high school students at McKinney Boyd High School, I stopped by to answer their questions in person. Love the enthusiasm of these Collin County students!
Spent the morning hosting Community Coffee events in Frisco and McKinney. Meeting constituents and listening to their stories is one of the best parts of representing you in Congress.

@stevenquezadaTX Hope you can make it!
I know that I work for you which is why I have always made sure I am accessible to my constituents. In addition to my 100% meeting policy, I’m excited to announce ‘Coffee with your Congressman' events throughout #TX03 hope you’ll join! DETAILS:
Thursday’s terrorist attack in Jammu Kashmir, India serves as a stark reminder that the threat of terror remains strong across the globe. Our thoughts are with the victims of the #KashmirTerrorAttack the Indian-American community here in the
Had the pleasure of dropping off valentines to veterans at @VANorthTexas today. We also discussed how we can better serve our growing veteran population. As one of the few combat veterans in Congress, I will fight to ensure we keep America’s promise to care for our veterans.
Today’s massive spending bill lumped together many of Washington’s worst traits to spend $328B buried in 1,200 pages w/ less than 24 hours to review. If we are going to get our nation back on track – we need to change the way DC operates bring our Texas solutions to Congress.
They do things differently in Washington than we do in Texas. Received bill text for the spending agreement less than 24 hours ago - working my way through 1,169 pages.
Blown away by Collin County students who have dropped off hundreds and hundreds of valentines to my office. I can't wait to deliver these to local veterans this week!
Listen in now!
Beginning 46 years ago today, 591 American POWs were released between February and March from Hanoi, North Vietnam during Operation Homecoming. Amongst them, former #TX03 Congressman Sam Johnson: the embodiment of an American hero.

The @EdLaborGOP kicked off the year with two committee hearings this week. Excited to bring some North Texas perspective to Congress!
Just introduced legislation w/@RepJimmyPanetta to allow all Medal of Honor recipients POWs who are eligible for burial at Arlington Cemetery to receive a full military honors ceremony. Those who have sacrificed so much for our freedom deserve to be honored as heroes. ��
Listen in to @660KSKY as I join @MarkDavis to discuss @POTUS’s second #SOTU address. �
Tonight, @POTUS reminded us that extraordinary bipartisan accomplishments are possible and I couldn't agree more. My first month in office has proven there are many issues that bring us together as Americans and I know we can bring real, tangible change to Washington.
At 9:00 PM ET, the President will address a joint session of Congress and outline his vision for 2019. What issues do you hope the President highlights during his second #SOTU address?
Met @SecWilkie at the White House to examine how we can improve veteran care. By modernizing the appeals process, utilizing electronic records, and expanding healthcare access we can give our veterans the care and treatment they deserve.
We must have great schools to have a successful community public schools are a beacon in bringing businesses to Collin County. I’m excited to serve on the Education Labor Committee where I can bring input from local teachers parents to Washington.
RT @NTxCommission: Great luncheon bringing our freshmen Congressmen together. Thank you @ColinAllredTX @RepVanTaylor and @RepRonWright for…
Joined @JasonWhitely @BudKennedy at @WFAA for the first time since I took office. Check out our discussion on our troops in Syria, security at our Southern Border, and my first month in Congress.

Thanks for having me!
Kicked off my Valentines for Veterans program this morning at Boon Elementary in Allen! A small gesture means so much to those who have served and their families.
Excited to see Plano represented on both sides of the field tonight! #SuperBowlLIII
Enjoyed meeting with constituents from Allen today and discussing the issues most important to them. I have always had a 100% meeting policy and will continue to do so in Congress.
As border security negotiations get underway, I stopped by @NBCDFW to discuss our options moving forward. As a Marine, I served at the US - Mexico border. Physical borders work must be part of the solution when it comes to protecting Americans..
There is still time to participate in my Valentines for Veterans Program! Simply create valentines for local veterans and drop them off at my Plano office. My team and I will hand-deliver each valentine to veterans at the North Texas VA. INFO:
Introduced legislation w/ Rep. @Malinowski to limit US troop reduction in Syria. I served in Iraq where we lived the creed, “leave no one behind” - This applies to Americans fighting overseas as well as those fighting with us for the cause. INFO:
Just wrapped up a conference call with education leaders in Collin County. As a member of the Education and Labor Committee, I look forward to working together with local educators, administrators, and parents to ensure our students receive the very best education possible.
Honored to have been named to serve on the @EdLaborGOP Committee and the @HouseHomeland Security Committee for the 116th Congress. Not only are these important issues for Texas, but they are crucial to the continued success of our nation as a whole.
Tune in to @KSEV700 NOW (and @WBAP247NEWS later) as I join @ChrisSalcedoTX to discuss crime at our southern border and what we need to do in Washington to keep Americans safe.
This week I cosponsored H.R. 20, the No Taxpayer Funding For Abortion Act and H.R. 369, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act. As a father, I know how precious life is and will do everything in my power to protect innocent human life in Congress.
Tune in to 1160 AM KBDT now as I join @JPKathyandCrew live from Washington, DC - discussing government shutdown and border security.�
Today, I delivered remarks on the @HouseFloor for the first time. I'm honored to speak from this historic dais for the opportunity to recognize my predecessor, Rep. Sam Johnson. While I will never be able to fill his shoes, I hope to follow in his footsteps. #TX03
U.S. national debt is at $21.9 trillion. The first bill I cosponsored in Congress proposes a balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution. Americans have to balance their pocketbook, the State of Texas balances its budget, so should the Federal government.
Disappointed Congress is heading home for another weekend while the government shutdown continues - but I’ll be on the phones with Republicans and Democrats. Both sides should be working around the clock for the American people.
Participated in a meeting at the White House to discuss border security this morning. It’s an incredible privilege to represent #TX03 in Congress and ensure Collin County has a seat at the table.
Tune in to @660KSKY now as I join @MarkDavis to discuss the government shutdown, my first week in Congress, and how I plan to make Washington work again.
After taking the oath this afternoon, I sent a letter to the CAO requesting my salary be withheld until Congress ends the government shutdown. Members of Congress should not be paid when critical federal employees, including our border patrol agents, are denied their paychecks.
Honored to be sworn in to the 116th Congress today and proud to represent #TX03 in the U.S. House of Representatives!
