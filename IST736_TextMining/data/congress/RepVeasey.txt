Democrats voted today to protect our government’s separation of powers and end Trump’s #FakeEmergency.

As Judge Ginsburg said in her dissent in Shelby v. Holder, our democracy is founded upon everyone's right to vote. As is echoed in the @RBGmovie, discriminatory voting laws have governed this country for far too long. Today, Dems pushed to restore the #VRA w/ H.R.4, on deck #HR1.
