I’m hopeful trade talks with China will lead to long-term benefits for our economy, but the administration must do more to create certainty and stay focused on the goal of holding China accountable.
The bipartisan bill I introduced with @RepRonKind, @SenatorLankford, and @ChrisCoons will provide much-needed relief to the American businesses and consumers paying the cost of import taxes.
This bipartisan bill is necessary because it’s clear USTR does not intend to meet the deadline imposed by Congress to establish an exclusion process.
Yesterday USTR Lighthizer would not commit to creating a fair and transparent exclusion process for the most recent China tariffs. Today I helped introduce a bill to require one.
I support President Trump’s goal of stopping China’s unfair trade practices, but we need to do so in a way that does not harm American farmers, manufacturers, and workers.
Just introduced bipartisan, bicameral legislation to provide relief for American businesses and consumers by requiring an exclusion process for the third round of tariffs on Chinese imports.

I want to thank my colleagues for standing with me here tonight, and I urge the rest of my colleagues in the House to support H.R. 962, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and stand against infanticide.
If we do not protect these innocent children from harm, then we are abandoning the basic truth of our humanity.
If we do not send a strong message that every baby has been endowed by its creator with inalienable rights, then we are not defending the fundamental principles of the constitution.
Tonight, the American people heard our call to action: it is time to vote on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Will the leadership of this House listen? Or will the Democrat majority continue to allow the march toward legalized infanticide?
These precious children are in peril. Their rights are under attack Their lives are at stake. And this House has a responsibility to act.
I have long fought to defend the unborn, but I am shocked that I now have to defend the right to life of newborn infants.
Thank you to my colleagues for joining me to stand up for the most vulnerable among us. We stand together to defend the sanctity of life and to speak out against a radical, anti-life agenda that would effectively legalize infanticide.

We must stand up together against this radical and inhumane agenda, and we must act to protect the rights of all infants.
Sadly, Democrat leadership in the House is standing in the way, refusing even to allow an up or down vote. This is not a partisan issue. It is simply what's right.
That's why my colleagues and I have called for the House to vote on H.R. 962, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a commonsense bill to require that medical care be provided to children who survive a failed abortion.
In states like New York and Virginia, legislation could legalize what amounts to infanticide and end safeguards that protect babies born alive after an abortion attempt. That is sickening.
I stand with my colleagues to speak out against the radical and dangerous policies being pursued by Democrat leadership in state legislatures across the country.
HAPPENING NOW: I’m leading a series of speeches on the House floor to call for protections for infants born alive after failed abortions. We must stand together against infanticide. Watch live on C-SPAN.
I just asked unanimous consent to bring the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to the House floor for a vote. Democrats objected. Protecting the lives of children should not be a partisan issue – it is just what’s right.

Sadly, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is needed more than ever with the passage of a radical law in New York state that essentially legalizes infanticide.
The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require doctors to provide medical care to children who survive an abortion attempt. I urge the Speaker to schedule a vote as soon as possible.
