Our Founders would be ashamed of the U.S. House of Representatives’ vote on #HR1.  #NOTforthePeopleAct My full statement:
#HR1 creates new spending mandates by creating a government match program of $1200 for every donation under $200. The last thing we need is a new Federal Government ATM for congressional and presidential races.
#HR1 might be one of the most egregious attempts by D.C. to take over elections that are the responsibility of our states.
Chatting with Mike Reeves WXJB in Hernando about #HR1, and more. Tune in!
RT @Heritage_Action: #HR1 is unconstitutional, unnecessary, and bad policy. #NOTForThePeopleAct
Check out this thread on #HR1, or what I call the Elect More Democrats bill.
This bill makes needed changes to ensure federal, state and local governments are responsibly and efficiently preserving our parks and public lands for generations to come. It also balances the protection and preservation of federal land, while also allowing sportsmen access.
My statement on why I'm voting no on H.J. Res 46.
My bill with @RepLipinski to expand I-Corps program to teach innovators how to turn their research into new products and businesses just passed the house with broad bipartisan support!
I enjoyed spending time with you all and am thrilled to be an honorary member.
My statement on @POTUS national emergency declaration on the crisis at our southern border.
This bill makes a mockery of getting serious about our crisis at the southern border. It's a spending splurge on projects and special interest programs. Voting for this bill would be voting to do the opposite of what I pledged to my constituents.
As an advocate of reducing spending, every year I return money from my salary back to the American taxpayers. cc:
