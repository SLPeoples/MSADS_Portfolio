It's going to take an all-hands-on-deck approach to reverse the decline of our nation’s water infrastructure. Federal, state, and local investment are necessary, but can't solve all our problems. Instead, we need to move away from "business as usual" and use every available tool.

I hoped it wouldn’t get to a point where the president contemplated declaring a national emergency. This is a failure of Congress. We must return to regular order and pass clean, timely appropriations bills. Anything less is political gamesmanship and harmful to Americans.
Democratic leadership has also waited three weeks to act on border funding, and in the eleventh hour -- as the government is on the brink of needlessly shutting down for the second time this year -- they negotiate a bill and attempt to force it through the legislative process.
This is déjà vu all over again: another massive spending bill with limited time to read it. Conference members had just one hour to review the provisions, the bill was filed after 1 am, and members are expected to digest almost 1,200 pages of text in time for a vote at 9 pm.

96% of women who enter Planned Parenthood's doors are sold an abortion, as opposed to receiving prenatal care or adoption referral. In contrast, the pro-life movement supports over 2,600 pregnancy centers, and provided 2 million people with free services in 2017 alone.
Annual reports from @PPFA show that their doctors have performed over 7.6 million abortions -- that's over twice the amount of American deaths than in the Revolutionary War, Civil War, World Wars I and II, Korean War, and Vietnam War combined.
Today and every day, we remember the millions of lives lost to abortion since the Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision 46 years ago. I believe that all men are created equal, even those who are too vulnerable to defend themselves.

It was my honor to defend the right to life today on the House floor. I will continue working to ensure that our taxpayer dollars do not fund a procedure that contradicts the core founding principles of our freedom and nation.
Abortion is not a human right. Abortion is death, and it is the exact opposite of the fundamental right to life. As freedom-loving Americans, we cannot back down from the fight to protect life and to protect those who can't protect themselves.
Unfortunately, @PPFA has a logic problem. CEO @CecileRichards tweeted last week that Planned Parenthood's mission is “providing, protecting and expanding access to abortion and reproductive health care,” calling an abortion procedure a “fundamental human right.”
Our Founding Fathers articulated that all are created equal, and that we are endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights: LIFE, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These are the human rights that encompass the American way and are the logical foundation for freedom.

The numbers don’t lie. Our country is experiencing a real and present humanitarian and security crisis, and the president has proposed real and present solutions. I look forward to his address tonight, and hope to work with my colleagues to implement swift and effective changes.
3) Treacherous conditions and corruption add to the severity of the situation. @MSF_USA estimates that 31% of women and 17% of men are sexually assaulted on their journeys north, and border patrol agents rescue at least 4,300 people in distress each year.
2) Criminals and gang members are taking advantage of a weak border. DHS reported arresting 17,000 adults at the border with existing criminal records, and 6,000 gang members, including MS-13. Each year, criminal organizations gain $2.5 billion in profit from migrant smuggling.
1) Illegal drugs are streaming across the southern border. DHS Secretary @SecNielsen reports that in 2018, agents seized 282,000 lbs of cocaine, 248,000 lbs of meth, 6,500 lbs of heroin, and 2,400 lbs of fentanyl. That amount of fentanyl alone is over 500 million lethal doses.
Tonight, President Trump will address the nation on the state of border security. In anticipation of his remarks, let’s review the facts:
