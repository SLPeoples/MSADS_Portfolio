Thank you @Mubarak_Mosque for inviting me to talk about public service during #WomensHistoryMonth. America draws its strength from our diversity. That’s why we need more women in office and more folks from all walks of life—no matter their race, religion, or creed.
Good government means working across the aisle to get the job done. I was proud to join my Virginia colleague, @RepRiggleman, in sponsoring this legislation. My first bill, the FinCEN Improvement Act, will be on the House Floor this Monday for debate.
Read about some of my incredible colleagues, like @RepSpanberger @RepElaineLuria, in this piece by the @washingtonian. P.S. it's true, we do text each other all day. #InternationalWomensDay
First, my colleagues and I passed a historic reform package that will make it easier to vote, get dark money out of politics, and return integrity to DC. Now, I get to come home to Lady Bear Wanda. Today was a good day.  #FridayFeeling #ForThePeople

Car title lenders in VA are making loans they know can't be repaid. Now, @CFPBDirector is blocking a rule meant to protect buyers from predatory pay day car title lenders. Either @CFPBDirector doesn't understand this issue (troubling), or doesn't care. Neither is acceptable.

Over time, the national memorial will serve as a report on which parts of the country have confronted the truth of this terror and which have not.Here are the photos of the monuments that represent counties in Virginia’s 10th Congressional district.
The memorial is more than a static monument. In the six-acre park surrounding the memorial is a field of identical monuments, waiting to be claimed and installed in the counties they represent.
The names of the lynching victims are engraved on the columns. Nearly the entire inner courtyard of the memorial is filled with columns representing almost 50 Virginia counties where at least one lynching has been documented.
Set upon six acres, the site includes a memorial square with 800 six-foot monuments to symbolize thousands of racial terror lynching victims in the United States and the counties and states where this terrorism took place.
According to @eji_org, “More than 4400 African American men, women, and children were hanged, burned alive, shot, drowned, or beaten to death by white mobs between 1877 and 1950. Millions more fled the South as refugees from racial terrorism...”
This weekend, during the Congressional Civil Rights Pilgrimage to Alabama, I visited the National Memorial for Peace and Justice. This site is the nation’s first memorial dedicated to the legacy of racial terror lynchings.

The fearless students from Parkland showed us what it truly means to be #MSDStrong. They mobilized a nation to stand up and fight for an end to gun violence like we've never seen before. When we come together to demand action, we can pass real gun safety legislation. #NeverAgain
There are concrete, common-sense gun safety solutions that the vast majority of Americans support: universal background checks, an assault weapons ban, funding gun violence prevention research. We honor Parkland by taking action. #MSDStrong #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain
School shootings can’t be the norm. Lockdown drills can’t be the norm. Congress must act. #EndGunViolence #NeverAgain #MSDStrong

We need to make #paidleave accessible for every American family, including Bret and Chad. Congress must pass the #FAMILYAct so that no worker in this country must choose between their job and their newborn child.
#Paidleave is the freedom to start a family.#Paidleave is equality for women in the workplace.#Paidleave is prioritizing workers over profits.#Paidleave is long overdue in our country is supported by a vast majority of Americans.It's time to pass the #FAMILYAct.
In our Commonwealth, 55% of working Virginians do not have access to paid leave programs.The #FAMILYAct would provide workers with up to 12 weeks partial income when they need to take a leave for their health, their child’s birth, caring for a loved one, and more.
This is not good enough.At the federal level, when we pass common sense gun safety legislation, we're saving lives.That's why I'm co-sponsoring H.R. 8 to guarantee universal background checks for every gun sale.

Mr. President: federal workers -- my friends neighbors from #VA10 -- are not your bargaining chips. Drop the politics, let's get to work on bipartisan issues like lowering the cost of prescription drugs rebuilding America's infrastructure. #SOTU

I met with the incredible folks at Northern Shenandoah Valley Substance Abuse Coalition yesterday. We discussed the great work they're doing to fight the opioid crisis, help people in recovery, and what we can do at the federal level. @WinStarVa recap:
I am proud to be a co-sponsor of H.R. 790, a bill that gives a pay raise to our civil servants. We saw during the shutdown how important every dollar of every paycheck is for federal employees.I’m happy to report that it passed the House yesterday!

I presented my first resolution on the floor today. The resolution said shutdowns harm our country and should not be used as a tool to resolve policy disagreements. Unfortunately, 163 Republicans wanted to defend the President instead of our federal workers and their families
The House GOP blocked my resolution. All it said is that government shutdowns are bad.Even after I amended the language for them because I wanted everyone to get to yes.They still picked Trump the Freedom Caucus over federal workers.
If you’ve been watching the House floor, you saw the Freedom Caucus oppose my resolution declaring shutdowns are bad for federal employees and the economy. I didn’t realize this would be so controversial. Read the resolution for yourself:
I’ve introduced my first resolution, H. R. 79, which expresses belief that government shutdowns are an ineffective and irresponsible political solution. We’re debating and voting on the resolution. Tune in live:

Passing common sense gun legislation will save lives.And reversing the ban on the CDC's studying gun violence will go a long way to helping us understand the true dangers of this health crisis. I'm a proud co-sponsor of a new bill that would do just that.

Yesterday the House passed three bills to allow much stronger restrictions and oversight on financial crimes. I'll have the opportunity to continue discussing ways we can protect consumers and workers as a new Member of the Financial Services Committee.
I introduced my first resolution today, expressing my strong belief that shutdowns are detrimental to the nation and should never be used to resolve policy disputes. I hope every member of Congress supports it!

I’ll be on @fox5dc with @FitzFox5DC in a few minutes. Tune in!
