Still fighting to #BringBackOurGirls! #JoinRepWilson
@jbendery @bannerite Friniwkt
Thank you! I am immensely proud of each and every one of you.
Today, I was proud to vote for #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act. I promised I would come to Washington to clean up corruption, get dark money out of politics, and restore voting rights. I urge the Senate to pass this legislation so that we can restore Americans’ faith in government.
Today on International #WomensDay, take a stand with everyone who won’t accept the patriarchal status quo and take action to change the things we cannot accept! via @UN_Women
Please don't try to beat trains. It is better to be safe and humans are nowhere near as fast as a train.
We've got your back!
On #InternationalWomensDay, my thoughts always turn to the #ChibokGirls whose girlhoods were put on pause after their abduction by #BokoHaram. I pray that those who escaped or were freed are able to realize their full potential and worth!
I refuse to give up hope for the 112 #ChibokGirls still missing five years after they were abducted by Boko Haram. #BringBackOurGirls #JoinRepWilson
This is a prime example of the sentencing disparities in this nation that force people of color and poor people to serve much longer sentences for lesser crimes than the ones Manafort committed. RT if you're as outraged as I am.
Keeping hope alive! #BringBackOurGirls @RepSusanDavis
A pension is a promise. A promise that after working hard your whole life, you can retire with dignity. Thank you, @steelworkers, for showing up in force at today’s @EdLaborCmte hearing on the multiemployer pension crisis. #ProtectOurPensions
Congressional inaction on the multiemployer pension crisis could cost as much as $103 billion in lost federal tax revenue and $138.3 billion in increased social safety net spending over the next decade. @EdLaborCmte
Retirees are not the only ones facing catastrophic consequences if Congress does not act on the multiemployer pension crisis. Active workers could lose their jobs. @EdLaborCmte
You can watch the @EdLaborCmte's Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions subcommittee hearing on "The Cost of Inaction: Why Congress Must Address the Multiemployer Pension Crisis" here:
This morning I will convene the first ⁦@EdLaborCmte⁩ Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions Subcommittee hearing! The topic is how to fix the multiemployer pension plan crisis.
Excited to chair my very first @EdLaborCmte Health, Employment, Labor and Pensions Subcommittee hearing on Thursday, March
I'd be ashamed to know so little to nothing about one of the biggest crises on my plate and embarrassed to have such ignorance repeatedly highlighted in public. RT if you agree that under similar circumstances, most people would find themselves out of a job. #DoYourHomework!
I am so pleased to be a member of the Democratic-led House in Congress. We get to set the agenda and lead the fight on important issues. Today the @EdLaborCmte is marking up a bill to ensure hard-working Americans earn a living wage. #RaiseTheWage!
When we put money in the pockets of hardworking Americans, they spend that money in the local economy. That’s one reason I’m proud to support the #RaiseTheWage Act. This bill is good for workers, good for businesses, and good for the economy.
By 2024, $15 an hour is the least a person would need to afford the basic essentials in any place in America; including rural and southern parts of the country. Workers should not be forced to work for poverty-level wages, regardless of where they live. #RaiseTheWage.
Today, a full-time worker making the $7.25 minimum wage has less buying power than that same worker in the 1960s. We need to #RaiseTheWage.
Gradually raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 will give nearly 40 million Americans a raise. That includes more than 164,000 in my district alone. I’m proud to support the #RaiseTheWage Act.
#HappeningNow � The @EdLaborCmte is considering the #RaisetheWageAct, a proposal to gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 by 2024 and give nearly 40 million workers a raise.
@EdLaborCmte will consider the Raise the Wage Act tomorrow. I urge all of my colleagues to support this much-needed
Want big money out of politics?Want clean and fair elections?Want public servants to serve the public, not themselves or special interests? I know that folks back home in Florida do. That’s why I’ll be voting to pass the #ForThePeople Act later this week.
Looking forward to voting to modernize secure our election systems by voting later this week to pass #HR1, the #ForThePeople Act.
Today I honor my grandmother. Frederica Finley Burke, a Bahamian native who migrated to the U.S. and owned an entire block of homes in the district I now represent. She taught me that genteel women can also be forces of power—and how to seriously rock a hat. #WomensHistoryMonth

My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of the devastating tornadoes in Alabama. I hope that they swiftly receive all of the resources and support they need to recover and
112 #ChibokGirls have been missing for close to five years after having been abducted by Boko Haram. I have not given up hope and remain committed to securing their freedom. #BringBackOurGirls  @RepYvetteClarke

Today we commemorate the courageous demonstrators who were beaten by Alabama troopers as they tried to peacefully cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge 54 years ago. Let’s honor their sacrifice by continuing their fight to ensure that everyone who’s entitled to vote can.

February is #HeartMonth, but I urge women to think about heart health every day. It could save your life! #GoRedForWomen all year long! @AmHeartAdvocacy
More than 90% of Americans support universal background checks. That’s why I am voted to pass #HR8, a bipartisan bill to #EndGunViolence and expand background checks – and it’s why I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to do the same.
@HouseDemocrats have already taken a stand to protect our democracy. It’s time for @SenateGOP to do the right thing and reject the #FakeEmergency.
As Black History Month comes to a close, I salute all of the wonderful African-American congresswomen who by virtue of their service to our nation are making history every day.
The abuse or abduction of children anywhere is unconscionable. We must do more to protect the most vulnerable. That's why I continue to fight for the #ChibokGirls and all of Boko Haram's other victims. #BringBackOurGirls @SpeakerPelosi
Today, the House finally passed the first of what I expect will be many measures to reduce and ultimately end the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our nation. We heard you, Americans. #EnoughIsEnough!
The last day of Black History Month! Miss Lael Ponder selected my name and dressed as me for the school’s live Black History Wax Museum Project in District 24!
The litany of abuses reported in migrant detention facilities paints a damming picture. The Trump administration needs to acknowledge that its immigration policy is failing and start treating migrants and asylum seekers with dignity. 
It was such a pleasure to meet with students from @univmiami today! I strongly agree with them that lawmakers must do more to ensure that higher education is affordable and accessible.
After 250 years of fighting for the right to vote, our democratic rights are still under threat. It’s time for Congress to #RestoreTheVote!
For voters today, voters tomorrow, and those who sacrificed so we could cast a ballot, we must #RestoreTheVote.
It is more important than ever to mobilize our electorate around the VRA protect the fundamental right to vote nationwide. #RestoreTheVote
I’m speaking up because our right to vote is under attack. Will you take a stand to #RestoreTheVote?
Congress has the power and the duty to act and restore protections against racial discrimination in voting. We must act to #RestoreTheVote.
For 5 years, GOP leaders in Congress have been complicit in the largest rollback to voting rights in 50 years. It's time to #RestoreTheVRA.
As a former educator, school board member, parent and grandparent of public school students, I know firsthand the impact that underfunding school infrastructure can have on student and teacher performance outcomes, safety and morale.
Making voting more accessible for all is not a “power grab,” it is patriotic! That is why I’m proud to #RestoreTheVote.
Today I #WearBlue to support voting rights for ALL Americans! #RestortTheVote
We owe it to America's children and teachers to significantly increase funding for public school construction and modernization, particularly in high poverty districts. @EdLaborCmte
The Trump administration owes Congress answers: We need to know how many families were separated and their plan to reunify every child with their loved ones. It’s time to end this cruel, government-sanctioned child abuse.
Critical infrastructure like our airports, bridges, highways, tunnels and more can be affected by rising sea levels and extreme weather events. We need to #ActOnClimate now and ensure that Americans have access to a reliable and resilient infrastructure network.
Climate change is not something of the future. It is happening now, and we must act quickly to reverse course. #ActOnClimate
Today, @TransportDems are focusing on ways to mitigate the effects of climate change by reducing carbon emissions and making our infrastructure more resilient. #ActOnClimate

This week, the House will finally take action to confront America’s gun violence epidemic. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act is exactly the kind of commonsense legislation we need in the fight to #EndGunViolence.
Looking forward to fulfilling my constitutional duty as we vote to protect the Constitution’s separation of powers end the #FakeEmergency! 
I applaud law enforcement officials for launching this sweeping operation, which led to dozens of arrests. Hopefully this will help spur the change we desperately need to combat human trafficking in Florida and across the nation.
It was an honor to participate in the unveiling of @univmiami's Black History Wall. Preserving and commemorating our history is crucial to ensuring we don’t repeat the mistakes of the past and continue to take strides toward a more just future.
My heart breaks for the 112 missing #ChibokGirls and their families. We must not let them be forgotten and continue to fight Boko Haram's reign of terror. @RepHankJohnson @GKButterfield @LisaBRochester @RepLawrence @EleanorNorton @SanfordBishop @JimClyburnSC @LacyClayMO1

The administration’s disregard for the dignity and rights of migrants, in particular migrant children, is reprehensible. Even after being ordered by a judge to stop separating families, DHS has continued this callous and inhumane policy.
