Welcomed Gavin Newsom to the U.S. Capitol for his first bipartisan California Congressional Delegation meeting as Governor tonight. We had a good discussion about how Congress and the state can work together on disaster relief, housing, health care and other critical needs.
Vietnam's terrible human rights record makes it undeserving of hosting the North Korea summit. If the summit remains in Hanoi, POTUS should at least secure basic human rights improvements as a prerequisite for enhanced U.S.-Vietnam relations.

I hope that because of his status as a public figure we can shed further light on DHS policies and procedures and that She’yaa can appear as a witness before the Immigration Subcommittee to help draw attention to these issues. Read my full statement here:
Was his arrest in response to his Constitutionally protected speech? It looks like that. If so, that cannot be tolerated in a free society.
Recently he released a song criticizing the activities of the DHS in its treatment of immigrant children at the border. It was just a few days later that ICE chose to arrest him.
And as a successful artist, he is able to give voice to the views of so many Americans who are critical of Trump Administration policies, activity that is protected by the First Amendment.
As it appears he poses no danger to society nor does he appear to pose a flight risk, questions arise as to why this individual remains in custody rather than released on bond while his immigration case proceeds.
I am closely following the case of She’yaa Bin Abraham-Joseph aka 21 Savage. His detainment brings into question POTUS's policies to initiate drastic enforcement actions that interfere with individuals' ability to follow the law and to obtain legal status

We need to know a lot more than we do at the moment. What this will mean for the Special Counsel’s investigation is essential. There should not be any interference by the President. The American people deserve an investigation free from political influence.
But it is clear that what was intended was nothing more than to divide us, and also to distract us from the threat Republicans pose to Medicare and affordable health care before Election day next Tuesday.
It was difficult to follow exactly what the President was proposing, assuming he even knows. He demonstrated difficulties with the facts and the law, but that's not new. I will have to wait to see what he actually rolls out before I can comment further.
No President can amend the Constitution by executive order. This is a ploy to divert the attention of midterm voters from the serious efforts Republicans have already announced to cut Medicare, Social security and Medicaid if they keep control of Congress.

Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s views are far outside the mainstream of the American public. His confirmation could have profound negative consequences for women. Judge Kavanaugh could accelerate the drift to favor corporations over Americans. I urge my Senate colleagues to reject him.
If you are a parent, it's hard to say how this is fair. There's no other area of the law where this happens. H.R. 2043 would help protect these children and other vulnerable groups in immigration proceedings by ensuring access to legal counsel.

The Family Case Management Program (eliminated by Trump) was an effective community supervision program that secured a near 100% court appearance rate for asylum-seekers. If Trump actually cared about ensuring compliance with the law, he could simply reinstate that program.
The solution to family separation is not locking kids in prison with their parents. The Flores settlement is in place for a reason, which is that indefinite incarceration of children in prisons is not a good thing and not consistent with American values.
The Trump Administration's enforcement of their cruel “zero-tolerance” policy is a clear contradiction to the values and beliefs the United States represents #KeepFamliesTogether

119 Republicans signed a letter to Pres. Obama. If those same members don't sign a similar letter now, we can ask whether they believe the rule of law and the prescriptions of the Constitution apply only to Presidents of an opposing political party, but not to those of their own
I plan to once again lead an effort with my colleagues expressing that same sentiment in a letter to President Trump. The Constitution and the War Powers Resolution apply as much to one President as they do the next.
Here’s that letter. As it states, the responsibility to authorize military force against a sovereign nation “is prescribed in the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution of 1973."
In 2013, while President Obama weighed a military strike on Syria in response to Assad’s use of chemical weapons on civilians, 140 members of the House – Republicans and Democrats – sent a letter asserting that Congress must authorize any use of military force.

The Trump Administration ignored these concerns and issued a policy that prioritizes mass deportation and mass detention over common sense and humanity. This is an anti-woman, anti-immigrant and anti-family policy. It is mean spirited, unnecessary and it should be reversed.
And worse, the medical neglect of pregnant women in immigration detention was well documented in a recent administrative complaint to the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
The detention of pregnant women is particularly concerning because these centers often experience outbreaks of chicken pox, tuberculosis and other highly contagious diseases that can have life threatening consequences for the mother and baby.
The so-called “pro-life” Trump Administration’s decision to detain pregnant women is shameful. Pregnant women need specialized medical care and immigration detention facilities are not equipped to provide specialized obstetric care.
