Proud of @EPAAWheeler and @realDonaldTrump’s work to reverse the 2015 Obama-era #WOTUS rule. The new rule will provide "clarity" and "certainty" for our American farmers and ranchers.
77th anniversary of Pearl Harbor – pivotal moment in U.S. history. America lost 2,403 service personnel, 68 civilians and all but 3 ships of the U.S. Pacific Fleet. Despite this loss, we gained something that day, the hard lesson that if America was to lead, we must be prepared.
Later today, @realDonaldTrump plans to sign the Coast Guard Authorization Act into law at the @WhiteHouse.  As an author of the bill and the former Coast Guard Subcommittee Chairman, I appreciate @POTUS strong support for the Coast Guard.
Great American.  #GeorgeHWBush
The Dept of Labor has issued guidelines providing relief for those impacted by the wildfires. Additionally, I am pleased to announce that the House passed legislation today that would, among other things, provide temporary tax relief for wildfire victims.

Proud to support the Coast Guard Authorization Act which passed the House. Next stop → @POTUS desk.  Read more about the bill
Situation at the border is a direct result of the U.S. government continuing to send mixed messages on our immigration process.  The fact remains, these attempts by immigrants to “push their way in” should not be rewarded and cannot be tolerated.
