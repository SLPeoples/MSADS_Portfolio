Democrats rejected the motion, rejecting children who survive an abortion to receive proper medical
Last evening, with the full House in session, I made a motion on the House Floor that would allow members to take an up-or-down vote on the ‘Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.'
I will continue to work with my colleagues to bring this legislation to the House Floor for a vote. Read more here
This legislation is a matter of protecting human dignity and should not be a controversial issue. It amends Federal law so that in the case that a baby survives an abortion, the doctor must do everything in their power to give the baby medical care.

The President is well within his rights to use the National Emergencies Act to combat the humanitarian and national security crisis at our Southern border. Our court systems are the true constitutionally-assigned checks and balances here, not Speaker Pelosi.

Thank you and congrats Skyler on the homecoming, and to you Cydney, on the birth of your twins!
Kansans did not send me to Congress to continue to kick the can down the road. I am not interested in talking-point solutions; I am interested in concrete solutions. Our Border Patrol agents told us what it will require to secure our border, and this is not it.

Today I met with the Kansas Medical Society to discuss rural healthcare issues facing Kansans. We talked about the need for Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) and the Conrad 30 program – which will help address the shortage of qualified doctors in rural communities.
Though outside my district, these growing Kansas communities clearly provide critical economic opportunities throughout the entire State and I appreciated hearing from them.
Many thanks to the dedicated Southwest Kansas community leaders from Dodge City, Garden City, and Liberal who stopped by on their trip to Washington to visit with me.
Thanks to the Kansas RESULTS advocates who stopped by my office today. Always a pleasure seeing Kansans in DC!

It was an honor to meet with M.K. Nava Boker, the Deputy Speaker of Knesset. Now more than ever it is essential for the U.S. to be a strong ally of Israel. Rest assured, I will always be a strong proponent of Israel and her interests.

On this day in 1911, an American hero was born. When President Reagan spoke of a shining city on a hill, I felt like he was talking about Topeka. He inspired me to join the Army and eventually run for office. Reagan’s legacy will live on - and he will always be an inspiration.
“The Republicans have come forward to negotiate in full faith and transparency and I’d like to see the same from the dems,” Watkins said.We have 9 more days until another shutdown. We’ve yet to receive a proposal from House Democrats.

We must come together - both as a nation, and as a body. Tonight, the President outlined a path forward, not for a Party, but for a nation. Watch my #SOTU2019 reaction below.

It is time to be calculated, precise, and absolutely merciless when combatting international
Combatting international terrorism is an ever-evolving dynamic that requires first-hand experience in tactical warfare. It is not enough to simply battle the threats of today; we must be preparing for the threats of tomorrow.
A great event with an even greater cause. All proceeds go to the Kansas Special Olympics and keeping the over 4,000 Kansas athletes with intellectual disabilities on the playing field.
Yesterday I participated in the 15th Annual Topeka #PolarPlunge put on by the @Topeka_Police, @ShawneeSheriff’s Office, Kansas Wildlife and Parks, and the Adjunct General’s office.
Congrats #MVPat. Big things on the horizon KC! #chiefskingdom @PatrickMahomes5
Yesterday I toured the VA Eastern KS Healthcare System facilities in Topeka. They are doing some amazing work with the veterans crisis hotline, which is one of only three in the entire country. I look forward to partnering with them on the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.
Education is the primary avenue for Kansans to achieve the American dream.
Still get chills. Two American heroes.
Absolutely disgusting. This is why the pro-life movement matters and is as important as ever.

Such an honor talking again with @SenPatRoberts. An outstanding mentor. Full of wisdom, advice, and jabs at my Army service. Thanks again Pat.
Another good faith offer from the President. The American people have suffered enough. We have three weeks, put the people before your partisanship Madam Speaker. Let’s reopen the government and secure our southern border.
The US is the global leader and how we are situated in the global landscape is critically important not just for our country, but for liberty and prosperity everywhere. When America leads, the world is a better place.
Was troubled by the disappearance of 14-year-old Chloe. Great work by Topeka’s finest in finding her. @Topeka_Police

As I stated to @41actionnews yesterday, the Democrats need to come to the table for good faith negotiations. What @POTUS outlined tonight is a common-sense path forward. @SpeakerPelosi needs to come to the table and end this shutdown.
Today is an important time for us all to be a voice for the voiceless. #life #prolife

It is time for our politics to represent the best of us, not appeal to the worst of us. For these reasons and many more, I am proud to vote in favor of this resolution.
Members of this body should be held to a higher standard. If we – as members of this great institution – cannot hold ourselves to these standards, how can we expect our nation to?
Today, the House voted on H.Res. 41, a resolution rejecting white nationalism and white supremacy. This type of rhetoric, this line of thinking, has no business being in these halls and the House should disapprove as a response.
Always a pleasure getting to sit down with @JackRCline! I look forward to working together on behalf of @KUnews. Rock Chalk! #RockChalk #ks02
My staff and I are fully devoted to delivering world-class constituent services. This seat belongs to the people of Kansas’ second congressional district. Everything I do will be to serve their best interests.
I have recently accepted the invitation to join the Problem Solvers Caucus, where I look forward to working on common-sense legislation that benefits all Kansans.
My very first vote was against Nancy Pelosi to serve as Speaker of the House. I co-sponsored the no work no pay act, as well as the defund planned parenthood act.
It’s always a pleasure getting to address the second district gop. I can’t thank all of these people enough for the support they’ve shown me over the past year. It’s truly an honor to represent these folks. So let’s talk about what we’ve done so far..
Here at the State Capitol for the @KansasGOP second district re-org. Always a pleasure seeing National Committee Woman Helen Van Etten!
Today is human trafficking awareness day – a day we should all ask ourselves if there is more we can do to combat these truly atrocious human rights offenses.As a Member of Congress, I will support initiatives that can help bring awareness of and an end to human trafficking.
4/4 We must continue to advance U.S. policy that eliminates anti-Semitism throughout all corners of the globe.
3/4 The appointed Envoy must also have extensive distinction in the field of religious freedom or combating anti-Semitism and must focus solely on monitoring and combating hatred toward Jews.
2/4 This timely legislation enhances the role of Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism. It elevates the Envoy to the rank of Ambassador who will report directly to the Secretary of State.
1/4 Anti-Semitism and like-minded hatred do not belong in our society, nor does it belong anywhere around the world. Today I was proud to vote in favor of H.R.221, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act.
It was great sitting down with you @RepDavids I look forward to finding ways we can work together for Kansas.
