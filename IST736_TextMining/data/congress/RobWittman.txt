Under @POTUS we’ve begun rebuilding our military striving towards a #355ship Navy.Retiring a carrier risks this progress moves us away from the 12 carrier fleet we need to secure American interests, project power, support the industrial base.
In honor of #InternationalWomensDay, check out the Navy’s first ever all female flyover honoring the life of Navy Captain Rosemary Mariner, one of the first female jet pilots.
The Chesapeake Bay is a centerpiece of the culture and economy of many coastal communities in VA. With today’s action, we are one step closer to ensuring that the Bay remains the economic foundation of our region that will be enjoyed for generations.

Each year the VA throws away billions of dollars on contract spending due to inefficient procurement rules. We must streamline this bureaucratic process to ensure we don’t compromise the level of care our veterans deserve. @RepJackBergman @RepHartzler

"The nuclear submarine fleet is the priority in the Navy shipbuilding program."  Admiral Viktor Chirkov, Commander in Chief, Russian Navy.  July 6, 2015
Witness at HASC hearing on Nuclear Deterrence: Ballistic submarines on patrol at sea aren't vulnerable to any form of Chinese or Russian attack.    I couldn’t disagree more. Don't just believe me. Trust the facts. Our adversaries are investing in their undersea fleet.
Any attempt to delay the procurement of Ford-class carriers or maintenance timelines for Nimitz-class carriers is strategically and fiscally irresponsible and will undoubtedly be met with the same resistance as it did in
Today’s EO makes it easier for sea service veterans to get high-paying, high-skilled jobs as Merchant Marines. Thank you @POTUS for not only helping our nations veterans transition into the civilian workforce but also revitalizing the vital force we have in the Merchant Marines.
The only way for lasting peace w/ North Korea is complete, verifiable, and irreparable denuclearization.POTUS was absolutely right to walk away from talks when Kim Jong Un took that option off the table.
Preventing acts of mass violence and protecting the rights our Constitution secures are not mutually exclusive policy objectives. H.R. 8 H.R. 1112 fail to fully accomplish either of these critical priorities.
Headed to the floor to speak in favor of S.47 The Natural Resources Management Act. This bill will provide for long term sustainability of LWCF and ensure Americans can enjoy wildlife and the outdoors for generations to come.
On SPF, one of my top priorities has been providing oversight on surface warfare training reforms working towards solutions to systemic problems facing the surface warfare community today. It is absolutely critical that we make these changes to protect our sailors at sea.
We will continue working with the Navy to ensure the proper readiness of our fleet and safety of our sailors.
The Navy has taken steps to correct deficient readiness. However, there are still systemic readiness deficiencies across the entire fleet that will take years of leadership focus and sustained funding to address.
Today @HASCRepublicans Seapower Readiness Subcommittees examine the Navy’s progress in implementing reforms outlined in the Comprehensive Review (CR) and Strategic Readiness Reviews (SRR) to prevent collisions.
Dollars secured in recent funding bills certainly go a long way, but broadband needs to be a part of the conversation for any infrastructure legislation too.
Our focus should be on the smartest ways to couple public dollars with private investment to expand access and enhance economic development.
The most effective way to build out an affordable network—leverage state, federal private dollars. The federal government shouldn’t be the sole provider here. Time and time again we’ve seen government run networks fail to reach the truly unserved.

Tonight, @POTUS outlined a bold, bipartisan agenda, with a clear path forward for America. → My statement:
There’s room for common ground to deliver results for the American people when it comes to: Maintaining military readinessRebuilding our infrastructureLowering health care costs.Let’s’ get to work. #SOTU
I agree that in this political moment we face a critical choice-- will resistance and retribution define the next two years or will we work together to deliver a strong, safe, and prosperous America? I choose the latter. #SOTU
The past 2 yrs of defense spending allowed our military to grow, strengthen prosper. Funding levels should be continued in FY20 and enabled by a budget cap deal to stem the effects of sequestration. Our military depends on it. Our country’s security depends on it #SOTU
We have made such strides towards rebuilding our military, including finally delivering a full year of appropriations for the first time in a decade. We must not lose the momentum that we have worked so hard to build. #SOTU
Thank you @POTUS for affirming the right to life. I know this means a lot to the countless constituents I’ve had call in about late-term abortion this past week. #SOTU
We need a health care system that protects individuals w/ pre-existing conditions and empowers individuals and families to make decisions for themselves based on what best fits their needs, wants, and budget. #SOTU
Other #VA01 projects I’ll be working to include address this Congress: Replacing Norris BridgeWidening depending Virginia portExtending I-95 Express LanesLane expansion of Route 301Addressing I-66 tollsResolving the Coleman Bridge toll#SOTU
.@POTUS is emphasizing how an infrastructure package will unleash economic growth. Broadband investment must be a priority. Rural Broadband will play a critical role in bringing health care costs down, connecting rural economies, unleashing untapped economic growth. #SOTU
I’ve been waiting for my colleagues to come to the negotiation table and finally recognize the crisis at our border for the true threat to our national security and sovereignty that it is. Can’t delay any longer. #SOTU
Our immigration system is broken. It’s very clear border security is national security, and without strong, serious changes we are putting our entire country at risk. #SOTU
Success from reg rollback tax reform is unmatched. To sustain the growth we’ve got to think long term. That means preparing our workforce to meet the needs of a 21st century economy.
A lot gets lost between headlines partisan bickering. But the fact is our economy is producing record job numbers, creating opportunities for Americans from every single walk of life. That's worth celebrating! #SOTU

Without question, the Air Force must start recapitalizing our nation’s refueling capability but we must do so responsibly.
While I’m encouraged that these new tankers were finally delivered to the USAF, I remain concerned that both the remote vision system and the centerline drogue system are not fully ready for operational use.
Today the Air Force accepted its first KC-46 aerial refueling tanker – roughly 17 months later than contractually agreed upon – with significant deficiencies that still need to be remedied.

We've made considerable progress in the last 2 yrs against terrorist organizations around the world. I believe reducing US presence in Afghanistan and immediately removing our presence in Syria will negatively affect the progress made and give more ground to our adversaries
At this time last month, I was in Afghanistan visiting our brave servicemembers and meeting with senior military and diplomatic leaders in the region to receive updates on continued anti-terrorism efforts.
I’m joining my colleagues in Congress by signing a letter to the President requesting a briefing on the strategic reasons for the Syrian withdrawal.
ISIS still has an estimated 20-30k fighters in Iraq and Syria. Allied Kurds fighting against the Syrian regime are abruptly abandoned. Russia retains a stranglehold on the Syrian regime and can expand its malign influence in the Middle East.
I have deep concerns with the President’s decision to immediately remove our military presence from Syria.
I urge Senator McConnell to immediately schedule a vote on this legislation to avoid a partial government shutdown.
I have received countless calls and emails from constituents over the past few days in support of building a border wall, and I cast my vote today in favor of protecting our homeland.
Although I am fundamentally against CRs, it is critical that we protect our nation.
Secretary Jim Mattis has served this nation with honor and distinction. He is an exceptional American and a true patriot. His contributions will not be soon forgotten. Semper Fi.
The bipartisan First Step Act, that is now on its way to @POTUS desk, will reduce recidivism by incentivizing rehabilitation, reform unfair sentencing, and offer more training and work opportunities to allow for a better transition out of prison and back into the world.
When it comes to our prison system, we need to care about meaningful prisoner reformation—not just raw punishment.
It is our job in Congress to fund the amphibious warships, particularly Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA) ships, to enable our Marines and ensure they can get to the fight.
Our Marine Corps’ amphibious ready group (ARG)/Marine Corps air-ground expeditionary unit (MEU) combination provide a viable option for future warfare.
Tax reform at work for Virginia.
We need a healthcare system that empowers individuals and families to make decisions for themselves based on their needs, wants, and budget.
It further showed that government-run healthcare does not sufficiently address the core challenges facing our healthcare system; in many cases, physician choice disappeared and premium costs skyrocketed.
Since the day we were told we had to pass the Affordable Care Act to find out what was in it, the law has failed to deliver on its promises to lower costs, increase access to care, and expand choice.
I’m incredibly proud of the 364 Virginians currently serving in the Peace Corps!
These governing-by-crisis situations are completely avoidable and until Congress can get these bills passed on-time, through regular order, I’ll keep introducing my Stay On Schedule resolution.
In fact, I said it this summer and I’ll say it again now, members of Congress should’ve worked through August to pass all the appropriations bills we’re working to pass now. We shouldn’t have gone home then and we shouldn’t now.
The Majority Leader just announced the next votes in the House won’t occur until Wednesday night. Until then, members of Congress will head home to their districts. We’re just over a week away from a partial government shutdown—we need to stay in town get the job done.
