If anyone has a stake in the future of our planet, it's America's young people. And these inspiring young leaders from Oregon and around the country are fighting with all they've got. #ActOnClimate #YouthGov
Congratulations to fellow Oregonian @kellysue. Can't wait to watch your creative vision come to life on the big screen. #CaptainMarvel #HigherFurtherFaster
Welcome to #RipCity where we’re always proud to stand up for free thought and expression.
The House just passed a bill to implement sweeping reforms fighting voter suppression and corruption. @senatemajldr is refusing to bring it to the Senate for a vote because he wants to make it harder for Americans to vote and keep big money in politics.
Empower women. Listen to women. Support women. Today and EVERY day, I am thankful for all women who work tirelessly to make our world a better place. #InternationalWomensDay
Thank you @PPAdvocatesOR for the important care you provide.
The Trump administration ripped children from their parents' arms and put them in cages. Then, it started blacklisting Americans who were attempting to shed light on these atrocities. I will keep demanding answers.
American farmers and manufacturers are being cut off from foreign markets today because of Donald Trump’s chaos strategy on trade. The trade deficit is surging and Americans are falling behind.
Today, I joined Democratic leaders to introduce legislation that will put real #NetNeutrality rules back on the books, so we can give all small businesses, rural communities, and independent creators a fair shot.
Once you pay your internet bill, you should get the bandwidth you paid for. I introduced the Senate’s first #NetNeutrality bill in 2006, because I believe that Big Cable doesn’t have the right to tell you how you can use the internet.
Families shouldn’t have to choose between getting a loved one the care they need in a nursing home, or signing away their right to go to court if something horrible happens. Today, I called on nursing home providers to justify why they support this misguided policy.
When intelligence leaders mislead the public about surveillance, they fuel the cynicism and mistrust of government that lets wannabe authoritarians gain power.
James Clapper needs to stop making excuses for lying to the American people about mass surveillance. To be clear: I sent him the question in advance. I asked him to correct the record afterward. He chose to let the lie stand.

Any hint of credibility Chad Readler might have had as a nominee disappeared the minute he put his name on the Trump administration’s legal argument that protections for pre-existing conditions are unconstitutional. I'm heading to the Senate floor to speak against his nomination.

Seniors in nursing homes are among the people most vulnerable to the life-threatening consequences of abuse and neglect. Today, @SenateFinance is holding a hearing to address the need to protect America's seniors.
Congress needs to take action to ensure long-term funding for schools, roads, law enforcement and other essential services in rural communities. These county commissioners from Oregon across the country agree: it's time to provide certainty for the #SecureRuralSchools program.
Proud today, and every day, to stand with @PPAdvocatesOR.
.@SenJeffMerkley has worked tirelessly to serve our state of Oregon and is a champion of working Americans everywhere. Looking forward to continue working with him to prioritize the needs of Oregonians in Congress for many years to come.
Climate change is real, it's here, it's happening. To kick the carbon habit, Congress must start with transforming the tax code to support clean, renewable energy. Not the dirty relics of yesteryear. That's the case I made today.
RT @TeamPelosi: It's time to restore #NetNeutrality
It’s time for the NSA to permanently end their phone records program. My full statement here:
Millions of women in America rely on comprehensive health care under Title X. Proud that my home state of Oregon is leading the fight against the administration’s dangerous rule, which will deprive millions of people of the health care they need. #NoGagRule
Just to be clear, Mussolini:   Rounded up Jews and sent them to concentration campsSubverted democracy and suppressed free speechLiterally wrote the book on fascism   The Republican party has truly lost its way.
My mother, Edith, worked as a librarian – a field largely dominated by men at the time. She was always fighting to give her family a better life, and taught me that when we support women and help them succeed, everyone benefits. #WomensHistoryMonth
March is #WomensHistoryMonth I’m reflecting on all of the women who have worked tirelessly to make our world a better place, and those who have impacted my own life.
There will be a lot of PR acrobatics about generic insulin. I’m not going to stop investigating how @LillyPad and other insulin makers keep raising prices on a decades old drug.
Thanks to @KGWNews and @NinaMehlhaf for having me in today to talk about drug prices, the Russia investigation, taxes and more.
We wish the members of Oregon Air National Guard 142nd Fighter Wing a safe and successful deployment. Oregon and our nation owe a great debt to you and your families. It was an honor to join @OregonGuard at today’s mobilization ceremony.
Thanks @KEEN for the incredible welcome today. What a great way to spend a beautiful Portland Friday afternoon talking about support for public lands and how critical outdoor recreation is to Oregon’s economy.  #OregonWay
Today @repblumenauer I met Joan from Happy Valley who told us her account of how the Trump tax withholding manipulation is preventing her middle class family from making necessary home improvements needed to accommodate her ailing father who has moved into her home.
As you can probably tell, I had a great time stopping by @wearewildfang in Portland today. Fantastic to meet with these young leaders, Josie and Lex, who use their female-founded, women-run business to empower women everywhere.
Great discussion in Portland today with @MSAOregon and @repblumenauer about how this tax season, American workers and small businesses are getting hit with unforeseen fees and penalties, and smaller tax refunds thanks to the #GOPTaxScam.
I am deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Norma Paulus. I have many fond memories of her during my time with the Gray Panthers. She had a wonderful heart represented along with Tom McCall Mark Hatfield, a brand of Republican that was the embodiment of the #OregonWay.
No one continues to be hurt more by the War on Drugs than people of color and low-income communities. It's time to end the failed federal prohibition of marijuana and right these wrongs by ensuring equal justice for those hit hardest.Proud to join @SenBooker in this fight!
Yesterday, I took to the Senate floor to tell my colleagues and the public why Andrew Wheeler is unfit to serve as the administrator of the @EPA.Today, I voted NO on his confirmation.
The Senate just confirmed a former coal lobbyist to lead the federal agency tasked with protecting our health and environment.    There have been a lot of bad days for the environment in the Trump administration, but today's vote will have devastating impacts for years to come.
The federal government has to be straight with the American people about threats to our elections. And Congress needs to do its job to make sure Americans’ votes are secure.
For those who don't have time to read, here's all you need to know: Georgia [missing 100,000 votes and excoriated by a judge for poor election security in 2018]: Our voting system is great. DHS:
If you care about the security of American elections and making sure your vote is counted you should read this immediately.
No American president has ever cowered in front of dictators like @realDonaldTrump.
Follow this thread from @WydenPress for live updates from my staff.
I’m heading to the Senate floor to speak against Andrew Wheeler’s nomination to serve as @EPA administrator. Wheeler has spent his career as an industry lobbyist fighting to protect those who endanger our health and pollute our air and water. I will vote NO on his nomination.
Here's the bottom line: the cost of your prescription drugs is skyrocketing because Pharma CEOs want bigger bonuses.

Proud to have worked to build on Oregon’s strong conservation legacy with final passage yesterday of the biggest public lands package in a decade. Once the bill is signed into law, Oregon will have the most wild and scenic river designations in the continental United States.
I am deeply saddened to hear about Secretary of State Dennis Richardson's passing. I so appreciated standing with him at services of the Oregon Fallen War Heroes Memorial in Central Point, which Dennis’s work made possible. My condolences to Cathy and his entire family.

Americans are sick and tired of the Trump administration covering for the Saudi government’s brazen actions. @SenJackReed, @MartinHeinrich, @SenKamalaHarris, @ChrisCoons and I are demanding answers.
Since the Trump administration refuses to willingly release the facts regarding the brutal murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, I am reintroducing my legislation that will require the administration to provide a public report on the murder and who ordered it.
The United States pays many times more for drugs than Germany or France, even though drug makers still turn a profit in those countries. If that’s not price gouging I don’t know what is.
Tune in to @SenateFinance for live updates from my staff.
I’ll be waiting to hear from execs of @abbvie, @AstraZeneca, @bmsnews, @JNJCares, @Merck, @pfizer, and @sanofi about why they are artificially driving up the cost of drugs, putting them out of reach for Americans who need them.
Today, 7 top execs from the largest pharma companies will be testifying before @SenateFinance about the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. It’s time Big Pharma provide American families with answers about the unjustified expense of these medicines.
Drug companies have been getting away with highway robbery, denying access for too many Americans who count on insulin to stay alive. Our investigation will look at how Big Pharma others set these prices. It's time that these companies answer to Congress American families.
ICYMI: last week @ChuckGrassley and I launched an investigation into pharma manufacturers that have sent insulin prices into the stratosphere, and out of reach for Americans who need them.
America’s democracy won’t be safe until the officials responsible for protecting our elections take the threat of hacking and foreign interference seriously. We need hand marked #PaperBallots NOW.
.@EACgov, the federal agency in charge of election security, is now run by someone who refuses to do her job and secure our democracy against those who would hack our elections. She even denies Russia interfered in 2016. (It did)
Covered a lot of ground when I sat down with @registerguard last week in Eugene for an interview - cannabis, hemp, mental health, rural economy, graduation rates, public lands more. Common thread in all that is putting the priorities of Oregonians first.
Before the president agrees to a deal, he should share it with Congress and the American people so we can judge whether it amounts to a better deal than the status quo, or if American workers will be left with more broken promises.
I hope that Trump is actually making progress to address long-standing structural trade challenges that the U.S. and others face with China.
Let’s be clear: what Trump is doing by declaring a national emergency over a border crisis of his own making is unconstitutional through and through.
Thanks to Deschutes County for attending today’s #2019townhall in Bend and the great conversation that shows again how open-to-all town halls give direct democracy the opportunity to be heard loud and clear.
This afternoon’s Crook County #2019townhall in Prineville has been postponed because of the potential for hazardous weather. The town hall will be rescheduled at a later date.
Thanks @HydroFlask for today’s fantastic tour of your Bend operation and for all the employees who took the time to educate me about how your business is growing along with Oregon’s recreation economy.
Reminder that just months ago, my staff on @SenateFinance published a report sounding the alarm about the windfall under the #GOPTaxScam for big banks.
The numbers don’t lie. The #GOPTaxScam is making big banks and their CEOs richer, while American workers are left with one more broken promise from Trump and Republicans in Congress.
A really thoughtful #OregonWay conversation at today’s #2019townhall in Madras that covered the rural economy, wildfires, graduation rates, Russia investigation, public lands more. #ListeningToTheFuture
Proud at today’s #2019townhall in Jefferson County to present the Senate-passed bill with wildfire protections in it for Crooked River Ranch to the homeowners who worked with me to achieve this key milestone.
The Trump administration will stop at nothing to keep women from getting the health care they need and deserve. This program is a lifeline for millions of low income Americans. This latest attack threatens their access to critical reproductive health services. #NoGagRule
Great to meet today in Portland with the @Zapproved team have such a thoughtful discussion about climate change, education, income inequality and healthcare.
Great to meet with students this week at Kalapuya High School in Oregon, who are showing why my legislation to provide alternatives to traditional education to boost graduation rates is so critical to get students excited about learning and help them succeed.
Trump Republicans in Congress have created a tale of two health care systems: one for the healthy wealthy, one for everyone else. The use of these waivers gives conservative ideologues free rein, letting them kick thousands of vulnerable Americans off their health coverage.
The Trump administration has done everything in its power to undermine America’s health care system. Today @FrankPallone and I are demanding @SecAzar follow the letter of the law, ending the harmful use and promotion of Medicaid waivers.
Looking forward to working with you and @fairfightaction to make sure no one’s vote gets lost again.
The sky’s the limit at @NorthMedford HS for #CTE students who are in this amazing rocket design program. Thanks for hosting me today in your planetarium educating me about all the great projects you are working on. #ListeningToTheFuture
Enjoyed #ListeningToTheFuture at @NorthMedford during today’s Jackson County #2019townhall from the school’s very impressive students. Great ?s from everybody about the #GreenNewDeal, the #TrumpTaxScam, healthcare, graduation rates, recreation, public lands protections more.
Voting machine companies like have lobbied state officials around the country to spend millions on new, insecure ballot marking devices, putting our elections at risk and wasting taxpayer money. We need hand marked #PaperBallots NOW.
�There are more than 100,000 missing votes from the November Lt. Governor’s race in Georgia.� The state used insecure, paperless voting machines, meaning votes can't be audited.
Thanks Lane County for showing up strong at @CottageGroveHS for today’s #2019townhall discussion and asking such good questions about the #GreenNewDeal, mental health, cannabis, veterans, homelessness, defense spending, gun violence more. #OregonWay
Very much enjoyed today’s visit with @Bethel_Schools students and teachers at Kalapuya HS in Lane County. Learned a lot about the many creative ways the school is engaging students to lift graduation rates.
No one is criticizing the Absher app over paying parking tickets online. It’s the tracking, controlling, and enabling the abuse of women that is the issue.
ICYMI: I am working with @SenFinance to expand my probe of Russian influence in the NRA and the 2016 election by examining meetings arranged by a conservative think tank for Russian agents Alexander Torshin and Maria Butina.
Very impressed by the ground-breaking work I learned about today at @CaseyEye how it’s making a huge difference in vision research care for people of all ages. Excited by all that’s going on and also what’s planned in the years ahead here in Oregon.
Big thanks to @eROI for hosting today’s great conversation in Portland about diversifying the tech workforce in Oregon nationwide, restoring net neutrality protecting internet data privacy.
Enjoyed celebrating a sweet day for Oregon agriculture this morning in Portland w/ @repblumenauer when @BlueStarDonuts rolled out its new hemp CBD-infused donut. Proud to have helped make this day happen by getting hemp legalization into the Farm Bill.
What a Sunday treat in Portland to drop by @SBellumsBakery in #MultnomahVillage with @smeieran this afternoon for great cupcakes made and sold by hard-working adults with brain injuries.
Direct democracy proved itself alive thriving at last night’s Multnomah County #2019townhall. Great conversation about the #GreenNewDeal, healthcare, LGBTQ rights, gun violence, the Russia investigation more. Thnx @PortlandCC for hosting.
Thanks @OCHINinc for this afternoon’s thought-provoking conversation educating me about ways you’re working on here in Portland to improve healthcare for vulnerable people through innovative technology.
Last month the Trump administration gave the green light for religious-based, taxpayer-funded discrimination in South Carolina, depriving foster kids in need from finding a safe and loving home. Today, this fight goes to the courts.
Powerful conversation today in Portland with the incredible YouthLine counselors at @Lines_for_Life who told @SMeieran I what they’re doing to reduce youth suicide. Great allies in my fight to increase access to counseling and mental health resources for youth.
NEW: After I raised the alarm about the Saudi government helping Saudi fugitives evade the U.S. justice system in Oregon and elsewhere, federal law enforcement agencies have launched an investigation to get to the bottom of these cases and hold the Saudis accountable.
Heading back home for my #2019TownHalls. This is the #OregonWay -  I hope to see you there!
Fitting that Oregon’s birthday falls on #ValentinesDay because we love our state. A very happy 160th to Oregon, the state that always blazes the trail for others to follow.
The only national emergency here is the damage Trump’s fragile ego is doing to the country.
His contempt for laws limiting government surveillance and his dangerous view that the president is effectively royalty and immune to facing justice make William Barr unfit to serve as Attorney General of the United States.    Today, I voted NO on his nomination.
Enough is enough. It's past time for Congress to do its job and implement commonsense reforms to protect American families.
The number of people killed in the #ParklandSchoolShooting: 17   The number of children in the U.S. who have died as a result of gun violence since: 1,200   The number of bills passed by Congress to put an end to gun violence: 0
Proud to have worked w/Morrow County all the local folks who teamed up in the #OregonWay spirit of finding solutions to make this exciting #Wheatridge green energy project between @portlandgeneral @NextEraEnergyR happen in eastern Oregon:
Happy 110th birthday to the @TillamookCheese Creamery. On this #NationalCheddarDay, here’s toasting (naturally with a Tillamook milk shake) to your unmatched ability to make cheddar better.
Another example of unfairness from the #GOPTaxScam: corporations and the 1% got billions in tax handouts, while working Americans got a new source of financial anxiety.
There is still heavy lifting to be done with the #RussiaInvestigation. In my opinion, if it looks like collusion and acts like collusion, it just might be collusion. @allinwithchris
Here’s what I had to say on the Senate floor about how this legislation has the late and legendary Tom McCall’s #OregonWay spirit.
Proud to have worked on this bill, which will continue our state’s legacy of protecting special places for future generations by preserving public lands, protecting recreation jobs, promoting economic growth in rural Oregon providing wildfire safeguards for Crooked River Ranch.
Thrilled the Senate today passed a landmark bipartisan lands package that’s the most comprehensive conservation effort for Oregon by Congress in a decade. #OregonWildlands #WildernessNow
I am demanding that @Google and @Apple pull down apps that promote abusive practices against women in Saudi Arabia.
Trump may not have any idea how important tax refunds are to most Americans, but you can bet he’ll find out if another prolonged #TrumpShutdown causes refunds to be delayed.
�Your tax refund could be delayed again if Donald Trump causes another prolonged government shutdown.�
I’m LIVE on the Senate floor:
I’ll be live on the Senate floor shortly to talk about the Senate’s bipartisan lands package. This legislation provides protections for some of Oregon’s most treasured spaces. #OregonWildlands #WildernessNow
Here it is, signed, sealed, and delivered on hemp paper! My bill to legalize hemp production in the United States, now the law of the land, will help farmers and small businesses in Oregon and across the country pursue new economic opportunities.
Last year, the Senate passed my bipartisan resolutions honoring the work of two pioneers in #STEM: Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper. I will continue working with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that these women get the recognition they deserve for transforming their communities.
On this #WomenInScience day, I'm reflecting on the incredible contributions women have made to the field. Too often, the impact of women in science is overlooked, but by recognizing their work, I hope to encourage more women to pursue careers in science.
It is unconscionable that @Google and @Apple are making it easier to track women and control when and how they travel. These companies shouldn’t enable these abusive practices against women in Saudi Arabia.
Children belong with their families, not in cages. Read more about our legislation to ensure children and their families have the resources they need:
At every turn, the Trump administration has put its hate-filled immigration agenda over the best interests of children. @SenKamalaHarris and I introduced our legislation to ensure that kids have the support and care they deserve.
A great piece by the @latimes about @brendatracy24 – an inspiration to me so many others for her courage and commitment to #SetTheExpectation
The most ambitious crossover event in history. @ChrisEvans #captainamerica
The federal prohibition of marijuana is wrong - plain and simple. Too many lives have been wasted and too many economic opportunities have been missed. It’s time for Congress to respect the will of the voters in Oregon and nationwide, who are demanding common-sense drug policies.
NEW: I introduced S.420, my bill to legalize and responsibly regulate and tax marijuana. It’s time to bring our country’s marijuana policies into the 21st century, and my legislation is the way to do it.
Nancy I are thinking of @RepDebDingell are so grateful for our long friendship. No one in public life did more to stress the importance of vigorous Congressional oversight than @JohnDingell, the importance of which has been shown repeatedly in just the last few days.
I’m blowing the whistle today: Millions of Americans could face the threat of a big surprise tax bill this spring because of the Trump administration and the #GOPTaxScam.
It’s year one under Trump’s #GOPTaxScam, and filing season is open. Let’s check in on how it’s going.(Spoiler alert: Not well.)
#NetNeutrality means that once you pay your internet bill, you get to go where you want, how you want online. This bill lets Big Cable create one internet for those who can afford it, while American consumers are left with something worse.
Republicans are selling fake #NetNeutrality. Accept no substitutes for the Open Internet.
America needs to kick its carbon habit. As Ranking Member of @SenateFinance, I will make it a priority to throw the dirty tax relics of yesteryear into the garbage can and put clean energy front and center for a healthier future for every American. #GreenNewDeal
Today I’m standing with @RepAOC and @SenMarkey to lay out our priorities for a #GreenNewDeal.It’s time for Congress to get serious about tackling climate change and creating more good-paying, sustainable green jobs. #ActOnClimate
Republicans’ health agenda amounts to slashing critical coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions. We will not let them get away with weakening core protections while lining the pockets of Big Pharma and Insurance CEOs.
Lots to celebrate this #NGWSD in Oregon where @OregonWBB @BeaverWBB lead the Pac-12 – one of many outstanding examples in our state of women excelling in sports. #GoDucks #GoBeavs
Listen to @RepCummings. The right to vote is the essence of our democracy. It's up to us to defend it.
This is more than an oversight. It’s flagrant, willful disregard for the safety and security of Americans. Meanwhile, instead of policing these carriers, @FCC and @AjitPaiFCC have been rewriting the rules to help phone companies rake in more profit.
This scandal keeps getting worse. Carriers assured customers location tracking abuses were isolated incidents. New evidence shows that hundreds of people could track our phones, and they were doing it for years before anyone at the wireless companies took action.
Read more about my legislation here:
When it comes to wine, craft beer, cider and spirits, Oregon does it best. It's time to level the playing field for craft beverage makers. I’m introducing my bill to allow these small businesses to continue to grow and create good jobs in Oregon.
Let's be clear on how cruel this is. The Trump administration didn't have to do this. It’s going out of its way to wipe out consumer protections and enable the worst abuses by financial predators.Working people will suffer because of this.
I have the only bill in Congress that will take the necessary steps to safeguard our elections by mandating #PaperBallots for all elections implementing rigorous audits to ensure every American’s vote is counted. It’s time to secure America’s elections.
.@staceyabrams I couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s time for Congress to get serious about protecting our democracy and fighting voter suppression. #AbramsAddress
My full statement on the #SOTU:
Wishing a happy Lunar New Year to those celebrating in Oregon and around the world! #YearOfThePig
.@SecPompeo do your job. Hold the Saudi government accountable for helping violent fugitives escape justice in the United States.
Republicans are denying voters what they chose at the polls: better health care.It’s no wonder Americans are fed up with our broken health care system.
We have invited @abbvie, @AstraZeneca, @bmsnews, @JNJCares, @Merck, @pfizer, and @sanofi to testify before @SenateFinance. They will come before the committee one way or another.
Last week, pharma execs refused to face members of @SenateFinance to justify the skyrocketing cost of their prescription drugs. Enough is enough. @ChuckGrassley and I are calling on companies to provide answers to the American people.
The Saudi government is torturing women’s rights activists on their own soil. Meanwhile, they're protecting accused rapists and killers from facing justice in the United States. This is abhorrent.
Just in case it wasn’t clear, Bernhardt has no place serving as the trustee of our most precious natural resources.
David Bernhardt checks all the boxes for another corrupt Trump cabinet nominee:Former oil lobbyistUndermining environmental protections to benefit corporate pollutersHad a front row seat to scandals at Bush's and Trump’s Interior Departments
Imagine if you put the same effort into reuniting children ripped away from their parents.
Thanks to my Senate colleagues @SenBlumenthal and @ChuckGrassley who continue to fight for transparency on on this issue through their work on @senjudiciary.
ICYMI:
Trump's attempts to discredit and limit the #MuellerInvestigation make it clear he's terrified of the details being made public. Two weeks ago, I said I'd fight to ensure the report is available to be seen by the American people. That is now more critical than ever.
Read more about my bill to enhance election security and implement paper ballots for all elections:
.@staceyabrams @fairfightaction I couldn’t agree more. It’s time to secure our elections and make paper ballots the law of the land. And I have the bill to do it. #FairElectionsNow
Thrilled to hear these books from @librarycongress will make their way to students and folks in Umatilla looking to promote learning and broaden horizons. I look forward to sending more in the future!
It’s time for lawmakers to hold @DeptofDefense accountable for wasting taxpayer dollars. Today, I’m joining my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to call for a timely audit of the #DoD to shed light on how these funds are being used.
.@SenSchumer, @SenSherrodBrown I are calling on the Trump administration to tackle China's trade cheating and not settle for a weak deal that shortchanges American workers.
Let me be clear: I will hold the Saudi government accountable for subverting the rule of law in the United States.
America is learning what Oregonians already know: there is growing evidence that Saudi Arabia is aiding and abetting Saudi nationals who are committing violent crimes on American soil, and abusing modern diplomatic privileges.
It is deeply troubling that individuals closely associated with the Trump campaign appear to have used shady, likely illegal tactics to undermine #NetNeutrality and to deprive Americans of internet freedom.
But I have deep concerns about Trump’s knee-jerk, politically-motivated plan. If done too quickly or with political rather than strategic goals in mind, withdrawing from the Middle East could pose a significant threat to U.S. national security.
The safe withdrawal of U.S. troops from the Middle East must be a priority for Congress. @senatemajldr’s proposal puts us on a path to endless presence of American troops, leaving them in harm’s way.
Last year, the Senate voted on a bipartisan basis to throw out Trump’s #DarkMoney rule. I hope this time around, Senate Republicans will support this legislation to increase transparency in our elections take our democracy back from over powerful insiders foreign meddlers.
In a gift to foreign meddlers and special interests, the Trump administration has turned a blind eye to illegal campaign spending in America. @SenatorTester and I are fighting back with legislation that would shine a light on #DarkMoney.
I’m calling on @Interior and @USDA to distribute federal funds for schools and infrastructure projects that were delayed during the #TrumpShutdown, leaving rural communities in Oregon and across the country hamstrung.
I grew up witnessing the gender pay gap firsthand. My mother was a librarian, and despite working just as hard as her male colleagues, she never earned the same paycheck. I will keep fighting to ensure that women aren’t cheated out of the resources they need for their futures.
It's outrageous that today, many women are not earning equal pay for equal work. When women succeed in the workplace, everyone benefits. I'm cosponsoring the #PaycheckFairness Act to guarantee that women are able to hold their employers accountable if they don't earn #EqualPay.
Any claims that the NRA played no official role in the 2015 Moscow trip are not credible.
At today’s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, I pressed FBI Director Wray about whether he will further examine evidence showing that the Saudi government has helped Saudi nationals accused of serious crimes flee the country, including my home state of Oregon.
Exactly why I said last Friday that I’m going to pull out all the stops to make sure the Mueller report gets to the American people.
Great meeting with @OSBANews today to discuss the importance of funding key education programs, investing in our rural schools innovative ways to increase graduation rates across the state of Oregon. I will continue fighting Republican attempts to slash these vital resources.
ICYMI: With the decision in #SouthCarolina last week, the Trump administration made it clear it would rather green light discrimination over the best interests of vulnerable kids. I will continue fighting this immoral policy.
Make no mistake: I will continue fighting to pass legislation to ensure that Americans and their families are able to access the life-saving medications they need.
Pharma companies claim they want to make their products affordable for everyone, but they couldn’t be bothered to show up today to discuss how we can make that a reality. Today’s hearing is just the beginning, as the @SenateFinance committee tackles rising drug costs.
This morning @SenateFinance held a hearing to address skyrocketing prescription drug prices, but not a single one of the largest drug companies were willing to testify. In 1994, even the Big Tobacco CEOs were willing to come to Congress and testify.
The #TrumpShutdown created regulatory paralysis for craft beverage producers across Oregon. @repblumenauer I are calling on federal regulators to work through their backlog of paperwork to help small businesses left hamstrung by Trump’s political games.
What's worse is that after blowing a $2 trillion hole in the budget, Republicans are saying there isn’t enough money for critical programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and infrastructure.
Turns out the #GOPTaxScam was, in fact, a scam.
|￣￣￣￣￣￣||   Protect        ||   Americans'  | |   Privacy        || ＿＿＿＿＿_| (\__/)  || (•ㅅ•) || / 　 づ#DataPrivacyDay
Today is #DataPrivacyDay. I will continue pushing my colleagues in Congress to step up and take action to put real protections in place to secure Americans’ private data. In fact, I have the bill to do it:
I’m demanding that the Trump administration immediately provide back pay to the federal workers hurt by the #TrumpShutdown, who were forced to go without pay for over a month thanks to Trump’s temper tantrum.
On this #HolocaustRemembranceDay, I’m reflecting on the consequences of failing to stand up to prejudice and hate. As the son of parents who fled Nazi Germany, I will continue fighting to ensure that America remains a place where all are welcome, and all are equal.
I joined @allinwithchris to discuss how I will lead the fight in the Senate to ensure that the Mueller report is made public.
You forced hundreds of thousands of families to go without paychecks and access to vital government services. You made millions of Americans suffer to help Trump secure a racist talking point.
This one is disgusting, even for Big Coal execs:   First the coal companies inflicted horrific black lung disease on a growing number of the miners, then they used their lobbying power to slash their contribution to the miners’ health care.
The bills @SenJeffMerkley and I introduced will force the Justice Department to get to the bottom of what happened, and create tough consequences for any government that helps flout the U.S. justice system:
More than a month after the @Oregonian spotlighted how Saudi Arabia’s government apparently helped accused criminals flee the U.S, the Trump Administration has failed to explain what, if anything, it’s doing to ensure these men face U.S. justice: 
Ending the #TrumpShutdown means relief for the thousands of federal workers who are struggling to put food on the table, and the taxpayers who rely on the vital work they do. Wasting $5 billion on a border wall is a bad idea today, and will be a bad idea three weeks from now.
One more Oregon casualty of this month-long senseless #TrumpShutdown is damage to job-creating start-up businesses like this one in Portland:
This witch hunt sure has turned up a lot of witches.
Make it happen today: open the government @senatemajldr.
More than two weeks after this #RonReport from my #2019townhall in Clatsop County, the continuing #TrumpShutdown is causing even more pain in Astoria:
When I had my #2019townhall this month in Tillamook County, I heard a lot of concern about the #TrumpShutdown on the @USCGPacificNW other federal workers. Here’s unfortunate but unsurprising new evidence of the shutdown’s impact there:
The damage from this #TrumpShutdown on Oregon’s businesses and the jobs they create throughout our state is undeniable:
.@senatemajldr open the government.
