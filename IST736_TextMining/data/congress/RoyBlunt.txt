As a former election official myself, I know how important it is for state and local officials to be directly accountable to voters. That's one of many reasons HR1, which vastly expands federal control over state and local election administration, is a terrible approach.

#GreenNewDeal could cost up to $93 trillion over the next 10 years – the equivalent of $65,000 per household annually. However, there’s nothing in the plan that says how families are supposed to pay for all the added costs they’d face.
#GreenNewDeal calls for the U.S. to use 100% renewable energy by 2030. The problem is that even President Obama’s former science advisor has said that’s not feasible.
The Democrats’ #GreenNewDeal goes far beyond the mainstream and includes policies completely unrelated to the environment, like single-payer health care and a federal jobs guarantee.

This shortsighted policy will not only mean fewer life-saving organs in our part of the country, it will adversely affect health outcomes throughout the Midwest.
Changes made to the national liver allocation policy penalize successful organ transplant areas and reward underachieving ones. These changes also disregard the recommendations of a panel of transplant specialists and medical experts.
The Midwest has established some of the best transplant centers and procedures in the nation. Our medical and transplant professionals have also achieved the highest rates for organ donation in the country.

The families I talk to are tired of the broken appropriations process and so am I. If Congress does the job it’s supposed to do, we should be able to debate and vote on every appropriations bill individually and get them to the president’s desk on time:
The bill also prioritizes programs that help ensure firefighters have the equipment and training they need to keep people safe, and gives law enforcement additional tools to combat major drug-trafficking organizations across the country and protect victims of child abuse.
50% of rural Missourians still lack access to broadband services. To help end the digital divide, the bill focuses resources to expand broadband to these communities. It also prioritizes programs that support #MOAg, a top economic driver in MO
The bill includes much-needed resources for BUILD grants, a program that invested $90 million in infrastructure projects in Kansas City, Scott City, Maryville, Sedalia, and McDonald County last year.
Like any agreement in divided government, the funding bill signed today is not perfect. But, it does prevent another shutdown, and provides funding to increase security at the border and support programs that greatly benefit MO
Under new national liver allocation policy, our state could lose up to 32% of livers from MO donors. In the @KCStar, Sen. @JerryMoran and I outline why this is bad policy how it was brought about by a flawed decision-making process.
Democrat obstruction is about two things: stopping the president from putting his team in place and wasting time the Senate should be using to do its work. Americans deserve better.
President Trump submitted 1,136 nominations in his first Congress. President Obama submitted 1,132 nominations and ended up with 206 more confirmations than President Trump. It’s totally unacceptable.
In every election, one thing is certain: at least one party will not be happy with the results. That does not give them the right to stand in the way of what voters decided. That’s exactly what Senate Democrats have done by abusing the confirmation process.
Bill Barr is undoubtedly one of the most qualified nominees to come before the Senate, having already held the position of Attorney General. Proud to have voted for his confirmation earlier today.
