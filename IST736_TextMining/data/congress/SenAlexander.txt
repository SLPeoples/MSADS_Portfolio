The weather is getting a little warmer, which means I have a lot more of the people for whom I work, Tennesseans, come to see me in Washington! Here’s a quick recap of just a few of the things I focused on this week.
I've been reading the recommendations to #LowerHealthCareCosts from 400+ docs, nurses, patients, insurers, employers and elected officials. As we work towards bipartisan legislation, my priority is for Americans to have better health outcomes better experiences at a lower cost.
Earlier this week I met with David Salyers, the new commissioner of @TNEnvironment, we discussed timely decisions to support cleanup in Oak Ridge and the Foothills Parkway. It was good to see David, and I thanked him for working for Governor @BillLeeTN and our great state.
It was good to talk with leaders of #HBCUs today. We discussed the specific challenges students who attend HBCUs typically face and how my work to simplify the #FAFSA will help more students get access to college. #MakingCollegeWorthIt
Thank you, @RepAdams, and the many representatives from #HBCUs for meeting with me to discuss updating the #HEA and my work to simplify the #FAFSA. #MakingCollegeWorthIt
I’m glad I had the chance to meet TN students Inshira Aden last night. Out of 100s of applicants from our state, these 2 student leaders were picked to attend the US Senate Youth Program. They are spending the week in Washington to experience their national government in action
Governor @BillLeeTN announced yesterday that @STULZ_USA is investing $2 million dollars and creating 250 new jobs in Dayton at its new manufacturing plant. Learn more via the @Chattanoogancom:
Here is what I want parents in Tennessee, in Washington, in Texas, everywhere in our country to know: Vaccines are approved by the @US_FDA, and meet the FDA’s gold standard of safety. #VaccinesSaveLives
Following the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, polio was eliminated in the United States in 1979, and since then, from every country in the world except for three. Polio is just one of the diseases we have eradicated in the United States thanks to vaccines. #VaccinesSaveLives
The science is sound: Vaccines save lives – the lives of those who receive vaccines and the lives of those who are too young or vulnerable to be immunized. #VaccinesSaveLives
I’ve heard a lot of good feedback today about the hearing I chaired yesterday in the Senate health committee to discuss vaccines. I want Tennesseans and the rest of our country to know that vaccines save lives. #VaccinesSaveLives

He provided crucial advice to Congress as we passed legislation to combat the opioid crisis. The @US_FDA is in better shape today because of @SGottliebFDA’s leadership.
Over the last two years @SGottliebFDA has taken the lead on implementing the 21st Century Cures Act to bring more medical devices and prescription drugs to market faster in order to save patients money.
Dr. @SGottliebFDA has been one of President Trump's best appointments. I am grateful for his service.
Internet fraudsters who claim that vaccines aren’t safe are preying on the unfounded fears and daily struggles of parents, and they are creating a public health hazard that is entirely preventable. #VaccinesSaveLives

Six Tennessee organizations have been awarded federal funding from the @NationalService to help involve more seniors in their local communities.
I do not know of a more inspiring example of the American character than the heroism of this 26-year-old East Tennessee soldier.
I was glad to introduce a bill with @MarshaBlackburn to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Master Sergeant Rodrick “Roddie” Edmonds, a lifelong Tennessean, in recognition of his heroic actions during World War II.
The science is sound: Vaccines save lives – the lives of those who receive vaccines and the lives of those who are too young or vulnerable to be immunized. #VaccinesSaveLives
It is important for those who have questions about vaccines, especially parents, to speak with a reputable health care provider. As with many topics, just because you found it on the internet doesn’t make it true.
Charlatans and internet fraudsters who claim that vaccines aren’t safe are preying on the unfounded fears and daily struggles of parents, and they are creating a public health hazard that is entirely preventable. #VaccinesSaveLives

Vaccines have been so successful that, until recently, Americans have lived without fear of getting measles, polio, or rubella. But, there is a lot of misleading and incorrect information about vaccines that circulates online, including through social media.
We know that some Americans are hesitant about vaccines, so today I want to stress the importance of vaccines: not only has the @US_FDA found them to be safe, but vaccines also save lives.
And even though 91.1% of Americans had been vaccinated for measles in 2017, according to the @CDCgov, we continue to see outbreaks of this preventable disease because there are pockets in the United States that have low vaccination rates.
Four years ago, this Committee held a hearing on vaccines, following the 2014 outbreak of measles – the worst outbreak since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000.
And in 1980, smallpox was declared eradicated from the world by the @CDCgov and the @WHO. This is a remarkable demonstration of modern medicine.
Before the vaccine for measles was developed, up to four million Americans each year contracted the highly contagious, airborne virus. In 2000, the @CDCgov declared measles eliminated from the United States.
Following the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, polio was eliminated in the United States in 1979, and since then, from every country in the world except for three. Polio is just one of the diseases we have eradicated in the United States thanks to vaccines.
His mother took him to Warm Springs, because that is where President Roosevelt received treatment for polio. Fortunately, because of her dedication, Leader McConnell is able to walk today, but thousands of others were not as lucky.
It was not that long ago that, as a boy, I remember the terror in the hearts of parents that their children might contract polio and put my classmates in iron lungs. @senatemajldr contracted polio when he was young.

…and determine whether we can both build the 234 miles of border wall that the president requested and avoid this dangerous precedent.
It may be a couple of weeks before the Senate votes on a resolution regarding the national emergency declaration so there is time for the president’s lawyers to take another look…
It avoids taking money for military construction projects specifically approved by Congress such as military barracks and hospitals. And it also avoids months or years of litigation, which could make it unlikely the full 234 miles are ever built.
Using authority already approved by Congress avoids the constitutional crisis of separation of powers. It avoids establishing a dangerous precedent, which could be misused by subsequent presidents.
There is a way the president can avoid this dangerous precedent completely: he can use the congressional funding authority he already has to build the 234 miles of wall that he asked Congress to approve in his January 6 letter to the Senate.
The late Justice Antonin Scalia said, “genius of the American constitutional system is the dispersal of power. Once power is centralized in one person, or one part of government, the Bill of Rights is just words of paper.”
Separation of those powers is a crucial constitutional imperative that goes to the heart of our freedom.
The Constitution gave that responsibility exclusively to a Congress elected by the people, and every one of us United States senators has sworn an oath to support that Constitution.
After an American revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive who could tax the people and spend their money any way he chose.
There is no limit to the imagination of what the next leftwing president could do to harm our country with this precedent.
If President Trump can build a wall when Congress has refused to provide the funding, then the next president can declare a national emergency and tear the wall down or declare a climate change emergency and stop oil exports and offshore drilling.
There has never been an instance where a president has asked for funding, Congress refused it, and the president then used the National Emergencies Act to justify spending the money anyway.
I support what the president wants to do on border security, but not the way he has been advised to do it.

From @JSunNews: Shiloh National Military Park expansion bill passes Congress. The bill would designate battlefields at David Bridge and Fallen Timbers, and the Russell House in Tennessee and Mississippi as part of Shiloh.
That is why I’ve invited my Democrat colleagues to join me, @SenatorLankford and @RoyBlunt in supporting their resolution to reduce post-cloture debate time for nominations and work in a bipartisan way to restore the prompt consideration of any president’s nominees.
The Democrat minority is determined to make it nearly impossible for @POTUS to form a government, to fill the 1,200 federal government positions that require confirmation by the U.S. Senate as part of our constitutional responsibility to advise and consent to nominations.
This is a problem not just for our Committee’s nominees—it is a problem for the entire Senate.
This meant these well-qualified nominees never received their confirmation, and had to be sent back to the president to be re-nominated at the start of the new Congress. Five of these nominees have been waiting over a year for their confirmations.
This Committee has already approved all but three of these nominees last Congress, but unfortunately, the Democrat minority has prevented these nominees from being considered on the Senate floor.
Today, the Senate HELP Committee advanced 11 of @POTUS’s well-qualified nominees to the full Senate for its consideration.

This week, all the attention was on the border wall, and that was important—Congress passed a bill with 22 billion new dollars for border security, including 55 miles of physical barrier. But we also got a lot of other things done.
Our country has most of the best colleges in the world. Students should be able to afford them, and borrowers should not be crushed by debts. #MakingCollegeWorthIt

When a student asks me these three questions about college: “Can I afford it? Is it worth it? Can you make it simpler to apply for aid and pay back loans?” I want to be able to answer yes. #MakingCollegeWorthIt
This legislation is a significant down payment on border security and a response to a major national problem. I congratulate @SenShelby, @SenatorLeahy and the committee for producing this result, and I hope the president signs it.
There are also funds to secure the ports of entry, through which so much of drug traffic travels.
In this bill, Congress responds with $22 billion for border security, which includes 55 new miles of physical barrier or wall on the southern border, an increase of 5,000 detention beds, and funding for technology and more border agents.
In his State of the Union address, @POTUS did a good job of establishing the need for increased border security.
Today, I voted for legislation that @POTUS will sign to provide increased border security at our Southern border and fund the government.
I'm glad Bill Barr was confirmed to serve as U.S. attorney general. He is widely respected, has shown great intelligence and integrity and has shown he understands that the job of the attorney general is to be the attorney for the US, not just for the president.

Now that we have started to turn the train around and head in a different direction on the use of opioids, everyone – doctors, nurses, insurers, and patients – will need to think about the different ways we should treat and manage pain.
And fourth, the new law requires the Secretary of @HHSGov to report the impact on pain patients that Federal and State laws and regulations that limit the length, quantity, or dosage of opioid prescriptions.
Second, we included provisions to encourage new pain management strategies, such as physical therapy. Third, the new law requires experts to study chronic pain and report to the Director of the @NIH how patients can better manage their pain.
First – We gave the @NIH more flexibility and authority to spur research and development of new non-addictive painkillers. We have backed up those new authorities with substantial funding – most recently $500 million to help the NIH find a new non-addictive painkiller.
We also took steps to ensure our new law wouldn’t make life harder for patients with pain, but now we need to take the next step to try to find new ways to help them.
Last year, Congress passed comprehensive opioid legislation to combat this crisis, which @POTUS called “the single largest bill to combat a drug crisis in the history of our country.”
More than 70,000 Americans died from drug overdoses last year, including prescription opioids, making it the biggest public health crisis in our country.
These Americans need more effective ways than opioids or other addictive painkillers to manage pain. Opioids, which are commonly used to treat pain, can lead to addiction and overdose.
We are holding this hearing to better understand the causes of pain, how we can improve care for patients with pain, and where we are on developing new medicines and ways to treat pain.
But on the theory that every action has an unintended consequence, we want to make sure that as we deal with the opioid crisis, we keep in mind those people that are hurting.
Here is the reality: we are engaged in a massive effort to make dramatic reductions in the supply and use of opioids – the most effective painkiller we have.
A new report released in 2018, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, says that about 50 million Americans have chronic pain, and nearly 20 million of those Americans have high-impact chronic pain.

Dan wrote, “She is not an abuser, and is doing everything right. Now it’s harder for her to get the medicine she needs.”
Dan, a constituent of mine who lives in Maryville, recently wrote me on @facebook about his wife, who has a rare disease that causes her chronic pain. Dan is concerned because it has become more difficult for her to access painkillers.

.@JerryMoran’s resolution to honor the 100th anniversary of @FarmBureau, which I co-sponsored, was passed today by the U.S. Senate. With more than 66,000 farms in Tennessee, farmers are critical to our economy and contribute tens of billions of $ each year.
I'm cosponsoring @senrobportman's Trade Security Act, a bipartisan bill that would increase Congressional oversight of tariffs. No state would be more damaged by these tariffs than Tennessee - in many ways we are the nation's number one auto state.
This week I announced my three main priorities as I work to update the Higher Education Act:-Simplifying the #FAFSA - A new, simple repayment plan for federal student loans-A new accountability system for colleges #MakingCollegeWorthIt
