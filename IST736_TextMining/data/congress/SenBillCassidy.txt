Congratulations to John Fleming, who was just confirmed by the Senate by a strong bipartisan majority to be President Trump’s Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Economic Development. I know he’s going to work hard for our country and make Louisiana proud.
Justice Guidry is exceptionally qualified and has served our state well for decades. I look forward to seeing him confirmed soon.
The Senate Judiciary Committee just approved Greg Guidry, President Trump’s nominee to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Next step is a vote by the full Senate.
@CNNPR My on-the-record statement was in the hearing, and it is clear. The only thing that needs clarifying is your reporting.
CNN mischaracterizes me, refuses to correct. “School” vaccination policies protect lives. Parents should have a right to medical exemptions. States have a right to issue non-medical exemptions to school policies, but should recognize associated risk of disease outbreaks deaths.

150 mil. people get their health insurance through their job, and most of them like their plan. But the Democrats' "Medicare For All" proposal would make these  plans illegal, and require taxes on families to double or triple. So if you like your plan, too bad, you can't keep it!

Shocking: CBO was scandalously off in Obamacare
President Trump’s nominees have faced 128 cloture votes in the first two years of his administration compared to 24 for all six of his predecessors combined in their first two years.
HELP Committee advanced 11 nominees today, most for 2nd time. These nominees have been delayed a combined 10 years since they were nominated by the president, thanks to Senate Democrats deliberate obstruction of the process. This is partisan politics and it’s bad for the country.

Let’s make health care better for patients by unrigging the system, lowering costs, and giving patients the power.
A one-size-fits-all, DMV-style, “Medicare for all” health care system would be great for government bureaucrats ignorant politicians who want to control what food you eat, what medicine you can have whether you should have children, but it would be terrible for everyone else.
Health care should be personalized, customized, innovative, and cutting edge. It should be about giving patients the power to make their own choices about their own treatment.
Banning private health insurance plans and forcing Americans to ask the government to see their doctor or get a test won’t make things better.
Socialism won’t solve the problem of sky-high health care costs, it will make things worse.
As Claire McCaskill said this week, Democrats’ new plan will “make ObamaCare look like a very light touch.”
Unfortunately, Democrats’ so-called “Medicare for all” plan would actually mean Medicare for none. It would require taxes on families to double or triple.
I welcome Democrats to the coalition to repeal and replace Obamacare. Only took 9 years!
