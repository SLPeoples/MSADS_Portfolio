Courts holding Trump accountable for thousands of separated children, as his immigration henchmen defy decency, humanity, the law. Cruelly torn from their parents, these kids deserve justice.
Placing journalists, attorneys, activists on a watch list may be a favorite move of one of the President’s many friends who are autocratic rulers, but it is not a tactic we should tolerate in our democracy.
Trump's vanity project to build a border wall gives new meaning to "no shame." Trump's reckless self-centered demagoguery is endangering our national security creating a true national emergency. Republican colleagues must vote with us to stop it next week.

And this is just the beginning. Cohen also told the House Committee that there are more Trump crimes under investigation by SDNY we don’t yet know about.
Cohen also testified that some of those reimbursement checks were signed by Donald Trump, Jr.—implicating Don Jr. in the ongoing Southern District of New York criminal case.
Cohen testified today that President Trump personally directed Cohen’s messaging to Congress, his lawyers reviewed edited Cohen’s statement—implicating Trump in a criminal conspiracy to commit perjury, making false statements, obstruction of justice.
These facts, if corroborated by other witnesses/docs, are completely damning overpowering in impact. If true, Cohen’s testimony reveals that the President of the United States has brazenly repeatedly violated the law lied to the American people.
There should no longer be doubt in anyone’s mind that collusion with Russia links directly to President Trump himself.
Per today’s testimony, Roger Stone, who was coordinating w/WikiLeaks, told Trump about releasing illegally hacked emails before it happened— before Trump made a plea for hackers to commit the crime again—implicating Trump in a conspiracy to violate Computer Fraud Abuse Act.
According to Cohen, Donald Trump, Jr. told President Trump about the June 9th Trump Tower meeting before it happened, Trump approved it—implicating the president in violations of federal campaign finance laws.
Cohen’s testimony is a bombshell. As set forth by him today, powerful compelling facts implicate President Trump in serious violations of the law.

Trump should think twice before dangling more pardons witnesses should think twice before lying to the Special Counsel in the hopes of getting a pardon. The prospect of state prosecutors bringing charges should be a warning: best to cooperate.

It’s clear the American people want to see the Mueller report. The time is now for Congress to pass the Blumenthal-Grassley Special Counsel Transparency Act. Americans have a right to know the facts.
I asked Barr whether he would at least allow Mueller to testify to Congress about his findings. He refused to commit. The American people deserve transparency. I’ll be voting no.
I am deeply concerned that Barr will do the President’s bidding put Trump’s interests ahead of the public’s interest.
Trump’s threats to derail or even obstruct the Russia investigation—as recently as the #SOTU—shows the need for full disclosure of findings evidence by the Special Counsel, which Barr has refused to commit to. I urge my colleagues to oppose him.
No commitment from AG nominee William Barr to disclose the Special Counsel report means he is likely to be Trump’s lawyer at DOJ, not the people’s lawyer.
#EnoughIsEnough Today the tireless work of countless Americans has led to the 1st hearing on gun violence prevention since Sandy Hook other senseless shootings. My House colleagues have opened a dialog to enact commonsense gun reforms—the Senate must do the same.
If he really wanted to unify the country, he wouldn’t threaten to undermine women’s healthcare/reproductive rights, or falsely vilify women kids seeking asylum as they flee persecution. Actions speak louder than words. Trump’s actions betray his words tonight American values.
His call for an end to the Russia investigation is another effort to derail even obstruct or avoid any accountability for potential wrongdoing. That line shows all the more reason why the Special Counsel must release a report w/all the facts evidence directly to Americans.
This #SOTU speech was a tale of two countries. President Trump’s calls for unity seem deeply hollow empty when he appealed to policies that critically divide us. He wants to build more walls—not bridges.
The Agent Orange Exposure Fairness Act will remove arbitrary obstacles barring Vietnam veterans, like my #SOTU guest, Gerry Wright, from obtaining the disability benefits needed to address the serious, ongoing health impacts of Agent Orange exposure.

Americans deserve to know what is in the Special Counsel’s report. That’s why Senator @ChuckGrassley I have introduced legislation requiring complete full disclosure of the findings, in service of transparency the public’s right to know the facts.
For me, the issue of releasing the Special Counsel’s report is a defining definitive test of a larger question: will Mr. Barr be the people’s lawyer or the President’s lawyer? The answer is unclear that’s deeply concerning.
I disagree with William Barr on policy issues from women’s health care reproductive rights to criminal justice reform civil rights. And importantly: I disagree with his decision not to commit to releasing the Mueller report or comply with a subpoena to release the findings.
Today I met with William Barr to ask him again to commit to release the complete Special Counsel’s report directly to Congress the American public. He chose not to. This issue is transcendent at this point in our history. Therefore, I cannot support Barr’s nomination for AG.

Americans deserve more “bang for their buck” than a wasteful wall from sea to shining sea. Wise investment should be the watchword for agreement before February 15.
Transparency is the linchpin of good governance. Senator Grassley I have introduced the Special Counsel Transparency Act to guarantee a Special Counsel's complete report, with findings evidence, is given to Congress made public.
If only the AG decides what to do with the Special Counsel's findings, we'll get the "Barr Report" not the "Mueller Report." Denying Congress the American people vital transparency. 
This decision reflects continued disregard for US allies abandonment of intl agreements. Congress must look ahead to the negotiation of the New START Treaty extension to ensure Trump Admin will restrain Russia.
