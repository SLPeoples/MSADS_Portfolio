President Trump’s national emergency declaration is a complete abuse of power. No President can be allowed to spend taxpayer dollars without authorization from Congress.
This bipartisan agreement will keep the government open and invest in effective border security, instead of funding President Trump’s wall, which security experts say will not work.

He also missed an opportunity to speak to America’s middle class families who are struggling to make ends meet.

All children should be safe and well-cared while in the custody of the U.S. government.
GAO will be conducting an independent investigation into the conditions migrant children face in CBP custody.  I requested this investigation with 21 of my colleagues in the hope that it will prevent future tragedies like the deaths of Jakelin Caal and Felipe Alonzo-Gomez.
Cruelty and callousness towards migrant children is a feature of this Administration’s policy, not a bug. The architects of this morally bankrupt policy have stained our nation and dishonored our values.
This would represent another outrageous attack on vulnerable children and victims of domestic violence. The DOJ should disavow this action, and if they refuse, then Congress should act to block it.
Also, I urge State Department and administration officials to immediately brief members of Congress on the national security implications of pulling out of the treaty, and how they plan to preserve and protect remaining global nonproliferation equities moving forward.
I urge the State Department to actively pursue negotiations with Russian counterparts to secure commitments before the treaty formally expires in six months.
This decision threatens the broader system of nonproliferation treaties the United States has spent decades building.
Unbound by the restrictions imposed by the treaty, Russia will be free to build as many intermediate-range missiles they want, putting our European and NATO allies at direct risk of further Russian aggression.
The President should affirm and rely upon the diplomatic arm of the United States’ national security apparatus. Negotiation takes hard work and tough decisions; walking away is not the answer.
Failing to come to a resolution with Russia for their violations makes us less safe. The U.S. should remain party to the treaty and work with the Russians toward a mutually beneficial agreement within the parameters of the treaty.
The Trump Administration’s decision to withdraw from the INF Treaty demonstrates their continuing retreat from United States global moral leadership.

Now with the government about to reopen, Democrats and Republicans can discuss ways to effectively secure the border instead of building a wall that security experts say won’t work.

This Administration doesn’t understand the struggles of middle-class families and they won’t even try. Their agenda is by and for the super-rich and special interests.
And the agency should abandon its ill-conceived plan to gut the bipartisan, and industry-backed mercury rule.
EPA’s mission is to ‘protect human health and the environment.’ Under Trump, the agency continues to do just the opposite. EPA should hold polluters accountable by levying appropriate fines when they break the law.
Ed Roberts revolutionized the independent living movement, crafting what we know it to be today. While much progress has been made, there is more to do and honoring his legacy means continuing to fight for #peoplewithdisabilities.

In addition to his national service in the Senate and on civil rights, Harris served his country in the United States Army Air Corps. It's only fitting that Harris passed away on the national day of service he helped to bring into existence.
Harris met my father in the 1950s when they were young lawyers. They enjoyed a long friendship. My family appreciated Harris' support for Governor Casey over many campaigns and his service as U.S. Senator and as Sec. of the Department of Labor and Industry for our Commonwealth.
Harris stood with Dr. King during difficult times and never wavered in his enduring belief in civil rights. He worked with Sargent Shriver to found the Peace Corps, improving the lives of countless vulnerable people throughout the world.
From his work on the Civil Rights Commission in the 1950s to his work as Special Assistant to Pres Kennedy for Civil Rights and through his friendship with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr, few Americans are more responsible for advancing the cause of civil rights than Harris Wofford.
Harris Wofford was a champion of justice and a man of uncommon courage who dedicated his life to service.

The House did it’s job by sending the Senate a Republican-supported bill to open the government but the @senatemajldr refuses to let us vote.
I have supported increased funding for border security, but I won’t vote to fund a wall that security experts say won’t work.
President Trump must end the shutdown he created and open the government. Once the government is reopened, Democrats and Republicans can talk about a range of ways to secure the border and reform our immigration system.
This Administration schemed to deny vulnerable children their right to asylum and then tried to cover it up. Secretary Nielsen is complicit in a policy of cruelty towards migrant children. She lied to the American people and is unworthy of their trust.

The MATS rule has received bipartisan support in the Senate, industry is by and large already in compliance and electricity prices are low. It's a moral outrage that the President has chosen, once again, to hurt people in order to please a special interest.
Instead, they have once again chosen to put the interests of polluters above public health; this time deciding to expose more unborn children to mercury pollution.
I’m not satisfied with Andrew Wheeler’s testimony at EPW today. The Mercury and Air Toxics Standard has enormously benefited the health of our children by protecting them from harmful pollutants. The Trump Administration should not tamper with it.
The Republican Party in this town has no credibility to say that they believe in protecting people with pre-existing conditions.

That legislation passed with 68 votes in the Senate and provided $40 billion in funding for border security. It also provided order, rules and certainty for individuals and businesses and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.
Once the government is reopened, Congress should have a substantial debate on how to fix our broken system and begin work on legislation that mirrors the bipartisan 2013 comprehensive immigration reform bill.
Instead of continuing his shutdown, President Trump should commit to signing the Republican bills passed by the Democratic House that would reopen the government and secure the border with over $1 billion in funding.
President Trump shut down the government to force the construction of a wall that security experts say won’t work. A concrete or steel wall is not border security.

Congratulations to Dillon and Jacob- you do Pennsylvania proud.
He also stated that he does not think it’s the “smartest way to use taxpayermoney on infrastructure.”
Former Commissioner of @CBP Gil Kerlikowske said in January 2017, “I think that anyone who’s been familiar with the southwest border and the terrain ... kind of recognizes that building a wall along the entire southwest border is probably not going to work.”
Building a wall is a waste of money. If the president is serious about stopping illegal activity, we should be investing in border infrastructure and security technology at Ports of entry, where most illegal smuggling happens.
The 2013 comprehensive immigration bill got 68 Senate votes. It provided $40 billion to secure the border and included a pathway to citizenship for immigrants.
