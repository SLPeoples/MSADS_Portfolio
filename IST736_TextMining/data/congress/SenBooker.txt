Happy #InternationalWomensDay! Today and everyday – may we all celebrate, honor, and cherish the incredible women around us by fighting to make sure they have equal opportunity to pursue their dreams.
TODAY at 12:45PM: I'll be sharing more about the Next Step Act at a press conference with my House partner on this bill @RepBonnie. Tune in LIVE:
My incredible Chief Counsel Tona Boyd is on her way right now to the Senate floor to officially introduce my new criminal justice reform bill: the Next Step Act!
RT @RepBonnie: So excited to introduce the #NextStepAct with my colleague @SenBooker.
I want to especially thank my House partner on the Next Step Act – @RepBonnie – for joining me in this work of introducing the most comprehensive criminal justice bill in decades. We hope this bill garners the same kind of bipartisan support as the First Step Act.
The Next Step Act would improve the reporting of police use-of-force incidents (currently DOJ is required to report use-of-force stats to Congress, but states local law enforcement agencies don't have to pass that info on to federal authorities, creating a big gap in data)
The Next Step Act would ban racial and religious profiling.
The Next Step Act would provide better training for law enforcement officers in implicit racial bias, de-escalation, and use-of-force.
The Next Step Act would improve the ability of those behind bars to stay in touch w/ loved ones, by banning the practice of charging high rates for phone calls (&gt; $400-$500 / month) ensuring authorities consider where someone’s kids are when placing them in a federal facility.
The Next Step Act would ensure that anyone released from federal prison receives meaningful assistance in obtaining a photo-ID, birth certificate, social security card, or work authorization documents.
The Next Step Act would create a federal pathway to sealing the records of nonviolent drug offenses for adults and automatically sealing (and in some cases expunging) juvenile records.
The Next Step Act would reinstate the right to vote in federal elections for formerly incarcerated individuals (blacks are more than four times as likely than whites to have their voting rights revoked because of a criminal conviction).
The Next Step Act would remove barriers for people with criminal convictions to receive an occupational license for jobs, such as hair dressers and taxi drivers.
The Next Step Act would “Ban the Box” by prohibiting federal employers contractors from asking a job applicant about criminal history until final stages of interview process, so formerly incarcerated individuals get a more objective shot at finding meaningful employment.
The Next Step Act would end the federal prohibition on marijuana, expunge records, and reinvest in the communities most harmed by the War on Drugs.
The Next Step Act would eliminate the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences (currently it is 18:1 but this bill would bring down to 1:1) AND make it retroactive.
The Next Step Act would reduce harsh mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenses: the 20-year mandatory minimum would be reduced to 10 years, the 10-year mandatory minimum would be reduced to 5 years, and the 5-year mandatory minimum would be reduced to 2 years.
I supported the First Step Act - a historic criminal justice bill recently signed into law – but that's just the beginning. Today I'm introducing a new bill – the Next Step Act – to push for bolder, more progressive criminal justice reform. Here's what we're fighting for:
40% of low-income students who get accepted to college never enroll because it’s too expensive. Going to college needs to be affordable – that includes tuition AND cost of living. That's why I'm co-sponsoring the #DebtFreeCollege Act w/ @SenBrianSchatz @repmarkpocan
The Internet shouldn't belong to big corporations – it should belong to all of us.  #NetNeutrality is the free speech issue of our time. I'm joining @SenMarkey and 40+ senators on the Save The Internet Act of 2019 to finally return the internet to the American people. #SaveTheNet
For too long, millions of Americans their families have been devastated by a fractured criminal justice system that overwhelmingly hurts people of color, the poor, mentally ill, abused addicted. Thanks to @Cut_50 NJ’s @wwngup1 for telling their stories. #DayOfEmpathy

Today, we honor Rev. Charles Boyer @RevCharlesBoyer for #BlackHistoryMonth, the founder of Salvation and Social Justice, and Pastor of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal in Woodbury NJ. His message of faith, love, and unity is needed now more than ever.
In this moment in history, during this crisis of conscience, I don't believe William Barr will lead the fight to protect our most vulnerable rights communities. I do not believe he will fight for equal justice under law. He does NOT have my vote to be the next Attorney General.
When I think of how bright our future is, I think of people like Rashad Wright and his artistic gifts. Well known for his talent in spoken word.  At the age of 24 he was selected as Jersey City’s poet laureate. Celebrating him this #BlackHistoryMonth!
Today, we honor @PrincipalAkbar, Principal of Newark West Side High School. Mr. Cook installed laundry machines in West Side’s basement to reduce bullying of students who couldn't afford to wash their clothes. His tireless work is an inspiration to us all. #BlackHistoryMonth
Today for #BlackHistoryMonth we recognize Sheila Oliver @LtGovOliver as the first African American to serve as Lieutenant Governor of NJ the first African American woman to serve as Speaker of the NJ State Assembly. Thank you for breaking the glass ceiling in government!
Happy Lunar New Year to all who celebrate. Wishing you and your family a year of great happiness and prosperity!
Proud that today New Jersey signed a bill to raise the state's minimum wage to $15/hr. It’s time we do that on the federal level for ALL workers! #FightFor15
A young man once wrote to Rosa Parks: "I wonder, will there ever be a time when all people will be treated equally? I believe that we as a people and the world are divided. I am fearful." Rosa Parks responded: "Let love, not fear, be our guide."
Finally – looks like President Trump is agreeing to #EndTheShutdown. It's infuriating that he put 800,000 American workers through over a month of hell for no good reason. This can never happen again.
"This is about our safety security our jobs our entire country’s economic stability. No one will get out of this unscathed if we do not stop this shutdown…There is no excuse to continue this. This is not a political game. Open the government today."
Major airports in NJ / NY area are experiencing serious delays – and the FAA has completely halted flights at LaGuardia. People's lives and livelihoods are being put at risk. The shutdown must end — now.

The #TrumpShutdown has thrown thousands of federal workers their families into crisis forcing them to make sacrifices that grow by the day—this must end. McConnell must call a vote on bipartisan legislation that passed the House to reopen the government.
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could reopen the government end the pain so many Americans are going through by bringing to Senate floor bipartisan legislation to reopen the government that the House already passed. We must end this #TrumpShutdown now.
The #TrumpShutdown is now officially the longest government shutdown in US history. The longer this continues, the more American lives will be hurt. McConnell must bring bipartisan legislation that already passed the House to the Senate floor for a vote to reopen the government.
Today is Day 22 of the #TrumpShutdown—now officially the longest government shutdown in US history. McConnell must bring the bipartisan legislation that already passed the House to the Senate floor for a vote to reopen the government. This can't continue.
Trump continues to lie stoke fears about an imaginary "crisis" at our southern border. The real crisis is with the thousands of federal workers their families who are going unpaid, can't make rent pay their bills as a result of the #TrumpShutdown.

We're 12 days into the government shutdown the impact is being felt across the country. 800,000 federal employees still don't know when they'll receive their next paychecks. Trump must end his #TrumpShutdown over his wasteful ineffective border wall.
Nearly 1 in 3 American families have 0 to negative wealth the wealth gap continues to grow, undermining equal opportunity. My bill would create a savings account for every American child to invest in themselves through things like buying a home or paying for higher education.
Happy New Year! Here's to a world full of more love, peace, and service in 2019.
The Senate took a bipartisan step toward fixing our tragically broken criminal justice system. This is a big victory for justice and our country—but we still have so much more work to do.
The Senate voted unanimously to keep the government open—but Trump decided to shut down the government over his wasteful border wall. Now 800,000 federal workers don’t know when they’ll receive their next paychecks. He must end his #TrumpShutdown.
President Trump said he would be ‘proud’ to shut down the government over his senseless wasteful border wall—but real people families are being hurt including low-wage workers who likely won’t get back pay. Trump must end his #TrumpShutdown now.
8-year-old Felipe Alonzo-Gómez is the second child this month to die in #CBP custody under this admin. This is horrifying. My heart breaks for these young children their families. We need answers—our government has a responsibility to keep children safe.
