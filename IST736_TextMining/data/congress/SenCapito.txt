I know things were busy in West Virginia at the state legislature this week, so make sure you didn’t miss this important broadband announcement!
Today on #IWD2019, I’m honoring some of the important women in my life: my mom, my daughter, my daughters-in-law, and my four incredible granddaughters.
Thinking of miner Adam DeBoard and his loved ones after yesterday's accident. Praying for peace and comfort during this heartbreaking time.

Unreasonable. Unaffordable. Unrealistic. #GreenNewDeal
This is why I support @POTUS’ emergency declaration. I wish he didn’t have to go this route, but the facts are undeniable. We have a security and humanitarian crisis at our southern border.
Welcome to West Virginia, Kayla! #GirlsInSTEM ��
.@US_EDA has played a tremendous role in economic development in West Virginia. Today, I spoke on the @SenateFloor about how we can continue working together to drive growth and opportunity in #WV. Watch my full remarks here:
I’m back on the @SenateFloor this morning to speak in favor of John Fleming’s nomination to lead the @US_EDA. Tune in here around 10:40 a.m.:
Awesome news! Congrats! #WestVirginiaProud #GoHerd
West Virginia is behind you, Alex! You got this!
Great meeting these two George Washington High Patriots, Azeem and Adam, West Virginia’s delegates to the @SenateYouth. I’m encouraged and impressed by their interest and enthusiasm for public service.
Here’s one of the practical policies I’m sponsoring to address environmental issues instead of the unrealistic #GreenNewDeal. You can learn more about the USE IT Act here:
We don’t need a $93 trillion turn toward socialism that fundamentally alters the foundations of our country. We are capable of making investments in technology and infrastructure to address our nation’s challenges in a common-sense and bipartisan way. #GreenNewDeal
Some say the #GreenNewDeal at least has Congress finally talking about climate change. That’s a huge disservice to those of us who have been working in a bipartisan fashion to deliver real solutions since before anyone had ever heard of the Green New Deal.
We knew it was going to be expensive. We knew the goal was to eliminate the coal and gas industries – along with the good-paying jobs they support in energy states like WV. This #GreenNewDeal is a massive shift to the left that goes far beyond anything Dems have proposed before.
I’m live talking about the #GreenNewDeal on @Senatefloor now. WATCH:
My staff and I loved meeting with West Virginians this morning and hearing about the issues they’re passionate about! #WestVirginiaWednesday

Whether it was finalizing the border security agreement or making big broadband and economic development announcements, a lot happened this week. Get details on all the issues you care about in this week’s newsletter:
What a week! Rather than just tell you about everything that happened this week in Washington, I thought I’d show you. Take a look at this special weekly video message.
.@POTUS is doing what he said he would. That matters to West Virginians.
Great with @WEN_National. I loved discussing the future of West Virginia’s energy industry, including pipelines and a natural gas storage hub. We also talked about working in a male-dominated field and how we can encourage more women to become involved in STEM.
This package also makes huge strides for rural broadband deployment, including $550 million I secured for a new pilot program. I’m really excited about this and how it can change underserved communities in West Virginia. #CapitoConnect
The gov’t funding deal the Senate just passed makes a significant down payment on @POTUS’ border security goal, and to help further achieve that goal, I plan to support his national emergency declaration. Full statement on the agreement I helped negotiate:
We’re still having fun, and you’re still the one! My valentine for the past 45 years. Love you, Charlie!
Awesome news from @archcoal! A new coal mine will be opening up in Barbour County! New jobs in the mining industry in West Virginia.
I am proud to have been a part of this process, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan deal.
Though conferees compromised on details, we did not compromise our principles. Passing this conference agreement is in our national security interest. It will provide the resources, the direction, and the support that @POTUS has said many times he needs to protect our nation.
This bill includes the highest level of funding ever in a Homeland appropriations bill to combat the opioid epidemic — more than $700 million.
Another government shutdown cannot and should not be allowed to happen. We need to provide certainty to our federal workers and to the American people who they — and we here in Congress — serve.
To my friends who — like me — want more money for the wall: This agreement is better for the wall and better for @ICEgov than any other alternative. Rejecting this agreement would cost dozens of miles of new wall and jeopardize ICE’s ability to detain dangerous criminals.
On the border itself, I have been clear that our agreement had to include three elements:   Physical barriers Technology  Personnel
However, it’s important to understand the difference between compromising on details and compromising on principles.  While this agreement may compromise on some of the specifics, it does not compromise on our commitment to secure our nation.
This agreement is a compromise between Republicans and Democrats and between the House and the Senate.  Because it is a compromise, none of us got everything that we wanted.
I’ve been a part of border security negotiations from Day 1, and I’m ready to get this deal across the finish line. Hear how this compromise addresses our homeland security when I speak on the @SenateFloor at 11:15 a.m. Watch live here:

I've said all along that I thought we could get this done, and I remain cautiously optimistic. Looking forward to continuing to work with my colleagues to finalize an agreement that keeps the government open and secures our borders.
Greet meeting with @Counties_of_WV this morning in Charleston! I’m proud to work with these local leaders to leverage federal resources, especially on issues like broadband, opioids, and economic development.

I’m very encouraged by @POTUS’ childhood cancer initiative. Last June, the President signed my Childhood Cancer STAR Act, and I know this push will only build on the progress we’ve made.

HAPPENING NOW:
Today is the first day of conference committee discussions regarding Homeland Security funding. As one of seven senators in these discussions, as the Senate Homeland Security Approps chair, I’m committed to working towards a solution. Watch live now:
Beginning in the early 1990s, we built barriers in 4 sectors at our southern border. Since each was built, those sectors have seen massive drops in apprehensions of people crossing the border illegally. Let’s admit that physical barriers need to be a part of the solution.
Most importantly, I had a chance to extend my thanks to these leaders and to the men and women of their organizations. They performed their duties w/o pay during the shutdown. Their commitment to their mission never waned.
I heard directly from CBP that they can’t do their jobs as effectively w/o physical barriers. Coasties, CBP, the American people expect us to work together to find a solution—including physical barriers, advanced technologies at ports of entry, more boots on the ground.
This morning, I had two phone calls to ensure I have the most up-to-date information going into today’s conference committee meeting. I spoke with Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan and @ComdtUSCG.
@Peggynoonannyc Country roads, take me home!

Honored to have been a part of this special day with my friend, @WoodyWilliams45.
Today in @EPWGOP, we’ll be hearing from Nicole Nason, nominee to be administrator of @USDOTFHWA. I met with Nicole last week and am looking forward to working together on Appalachian Highway concerns. Watch the hearing at 10 a.m. here:

Border security IS critical to the safety of our nation. As a conferee in the DHS appropriations bill negotiations, I will continue to advocate for this national priority.
I wrote a bill with funding for physical barriers in June, which passed with bipartisan support. I’m committed to do it again. #LetsGetToWork
As chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations subcommittee, I have worked extensively over the past year with @DHSgov, Border Patrol, Democrats, and Republicans alike.
Proud to say I will be one of seven senators serving on the conference committee to negotiate the Homeland Security Appropriations package.
My full statement on the agreement to reopen the federal government:
HAPPENING NOW: Speaking on the @SenateFloor about the deal reached to end the partial government shutdown. WATCH LIVE:
Loved being in Martinsburg today to honor Medal of Honor recipients. And it’s always good to see my friend @WoodyWilliams45. Thank you to all the veterans on hand today for safeguarding our freedom. Congratulations on the new Medal of Honor Wall!
Catch me on @Talkradiowrnr today at 9:15 a.m. I hope you’ll tune in as we discuss yesterday’s Senate votes and what I’m doing to move forward so federal workers can get back to work and we can secure our border. Listen here:
I just got off the Senate floor. Here’s why I voted for @POTUS’ compromise bill. Read more about my vote here:
The president’s proposal represents an honest effort to reopen the government and strengthen border security—a good faith offer that includes both Republican and Democrat priorities.
GOP BILL: End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act (aka @POTUS’ proposal) would immediately reopen the closed portions of the government and fund border security.DEM BILL: Would fund the government through February 8 without funding for any physical barrier at the border.
This is one of the reasons I care so deeply about border security. Stopping drugs at the border means stopping them before they get to West Virginia communities.
I believe we should embrace that spirit of compromise to end this shutdown and secure our border. What can’t be compromised is our nation’s security.
No one — not the president — not any senator — and not any representative gets everything they want in this bill. That is the nature of compromise.
.@POTUS has made a significant concession by asking that we include a provision giving three years of certainty to those covered by the DACA executive order — as well as some who have been on Temporary Protective Status. That provision is included in this amendment.
The amendment that Dems have proposed reopens the government through February 8th. It provides no new resources to address the security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border. Passing the Schumer plan would put us in the same situation on February 8th that exists today.
The combination of technology and personnel — both at our ports of entry and along the border —along with the border wall system will enhance our security and choke off a major source of the heroin and fentanyl that has devastated families in West Virginia and across the country.
We have 654 miles of physical barrier in place today. If we pass this amendment, we can build 234 more miles in areas like the Rio Grande Valley, where career Border Patrol personnel tell us it is needed most.
We are here in this body to work together. To get over any rifts we may have, and to move forward to do the people’s work. We have to fix this situation, and we have to fix it now. We can do that with the president’s proposed compromise.
A shutdown is no way to govern. It’s a disservice to our federal workers. It shows our inability to do our job with those on the other side of the aisle. It’s a signal to the American people that we think this confusing and ineffective way to run the government is OK. It’s not.
In the past several days and weeks, there has been a lot of talk about who has leverage, who is “winning,” and what the political stakes are. Those are not the questions on the minds of federal workers.
