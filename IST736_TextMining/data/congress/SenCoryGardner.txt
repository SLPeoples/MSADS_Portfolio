Decreasing pressure without concrete steps toward denuclearization by Kim Jong Un’s regime is a step in the wrong direction.
Maximum pressure means that we must utilize every tool at our disposal in equal measure—economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and robust military posture—to achieve our goal of complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.
The reason why these exercises are necessary is because of North Korea’s historically hostile behavior and repeated violations of international law.
I oppose any steps toward normalization without denuclearization of the North Korean regime—the United States should not sacrifice joint military readiness with our allies to appease Kim Jong

The passage of this bill is a major victory for our nation’s global standing and a genuine bipartisan success on behalf of the American people. @SenMarkey and I have worked tirelessly to advance this legislation and I look forward to ARIA being signed into law.
Therefore, ARIA establishes provides new resources for a long-term strategy to enhance security cooperation with our allies; to promote American businesses through trade opportunities; to project American values of democracy, human rights, the rule of law in the region.
ARIA is important because the Indo-Pacific is home to half of the world’s population GDP, the world’s largest standing armies, six US defense treaty allies. The security economic future of the US depends on having the right policies to ensure a free open Indo-Pacific.
After years of bipartisan work, ARIA is now headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law. This crucial legislation - endorsed by the Administration, policy experts, and the business community - will ensure the US remains the leading Pacific power for generations to come.
I urge President Trump to immediately halt any plans to withdraw US troops from Syria and to consult with Congress on a long-term Syria strategy that protects US national interests and denies a win for Vladimir Putin, Bashar al-Assad, and the Iranian mullahs.
The US is the only global power able to stop Russia, Iran, their terrorist proxies in Syria from total control of a region vital to national security. We've made significant progress in our fight against ISIS but the fight isn't over, a US withdrawal will embolden bad actors.

While we are debating criminal justice reform, we need to address the threat of prosecution by the federal government for people in Colorado that are operating legal businesses under state law - and it’s not just Colorado.
