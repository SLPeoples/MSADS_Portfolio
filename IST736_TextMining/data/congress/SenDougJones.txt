Far too many Alabama hospitals have closed down. Far too many Alabamians go without access to quality, affordable health care. It’s long past time for Alabama to #ExpandMedicaid.

“What are you doing on Capitol Hill to bring forth bipartisanship?”
“Do you have any advice for students who are looking to pursue a career in public service?”
“What do you think we can do to reduce the amount of student debt in the U.S. so that it is not such a big problem in our lives?” “Find ways to actually bring down the cost of higher education, increase the availability for grants/scholarships, increase loan forgiveness.”
A big hello to Murphy High Panthers! �� Sen. Jones held a virtual town hall w/ @murphyacademies. Students had great questions on topics from college debt to the importance of bipartisanship. Here's a look at what they asked:

“How many more rural health care providers need to close for meaningful action to be taken?” Jones said. “This should be a wake-up call — actually, another wake-up call.”
“88% of Alabama’s rural hospitals are operating in the red, which means that they are not receiving enough reimbursement to account for the cost of care.”  7 rural AL hospitals have closed since 2011 -- it’s long past time to #ExpandMedicaid increase access to health care.

There is more to be said that just can’t be done in a few tweets, so I’d urge you to read my full statement here: -- Doug
After thorough consideration, I have concluded that Mr. Barr is qualified for the position his record strongly suggests he will exercise independent judgment uphold the best interests of the DoJ. I will vote to confirm Mr. Barr as AG of the United States.
Finally, in my conversation w/ Mr. Barr, I stressed how important the DoJ’s civil rights functions are to me the people of Alabama. Mr. Barr assured me of his commitment to protecting civil rights, including the vigorous enforcement of voting rights protections.
Some have expressed concerns about Mr. Barr’s views of executive power, which frankly are much more expansive than my own. In his hearing in my conversation w/him, he reiterated that he believes no one -- including the President of the United States -- is above the law.
As a former US Attorney, I believe the most important responsibility of an AG l is to uphold the rule of law to do so w/a commitment to transparency independence. We live in deeply divided times, but it is in precisely this environment that these principles are critical.
I have spent nearly two months examining Mr. Barr’s record, watching his hearings, and listening to considering the input of my constituents leaders in the justice community. I have spoken with Mr. Barr and asked him some tough questions of my own.
