Encouraged to see young cattle producers visiting DC this week with @MSCattlemen advocating for commonsense and beneficial agriculture policy.
This is good news for MS agriculture. Thank you @POTUS for signing this important legislation.
It's an honor to serve with such talented and intelligent women. I hope our service inspires other women to have confidence in going for their goals. #InternationalWomensDay

Congratulations Dr. Alicia Oliver on being named the American College of Veterinary Pathologists (@ACVP) Mentor of the Year. I appreciate you and Dr. Kent Hoblet’s leadership at @cvm_msstate.
Great meeting with Chief Phyliss Anderson of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians. We talked about the future of tribal education and healthcare in Mississippi.
The Green New Deal is unrealistic, unworkable, and unaffordable. The $65K per year burden this scheme would put on families is well above the median household income in Mississippi.
There’s no place like Southwest MS.  Thank you @NatchezInc and Adams County for bringing a little piece of home to DC. I enjoyed our visit.
I applaud @realDonaldTrump for taking action to address the tragedy of veteran suicide. Our nation's heroes and their families should benefit from this initiative to end this national tragedy.
Enjoyed visiting with Jan Reid-Bunch of @JDRF to talk about the strides being made in juvenile diabetes. The research for a cure is so encouraging.
Today Mary Nelson of Greenville and Tiffany Alsbury of Brookhaven stopped by my office to share their stories. These women are living with lupus and I am blown away by their fight and courage. @LupusOrg
Manufacturing is a solid and growing sector in our state’s economy, and this investment will help ensure small and medium-sized companies and the workforce in Mississippi can adapt to meet changing market demands.
#CWD has hit home, but MS is well-positioned to lead the fight w/the @msstate @cvm_msstate @MSUExtService other assets. I've introduced the DEER Act to provide resources to state departments of wildlife agriculture for #CWD response activities.
Congratulations on a stellar regular season! #HailState
A member of my staff, Lindsay Linhares, will be among the alumni recognized by @MSState. She’s among a strong class of @MSStateAlumni honorees who continue to use their degrees to serve. 
Hats off to the crew of the Jacob Poroo, a @USCG fast response cutter homeported in Pascagoula, for their vigilance and excellent work to foil three Mexican boats illegally fishing for red snapper and sharks in the Gulf of Mexico.
A pleasure to visit this week with members of the MS Wing @CivilAirPatrol, which has 19 squadrons across the state. Thanked them for all their work in our state and for the nation and gladly accepted their invitation to join the CAP Congressional
Mississippians are proud of the achievements of so many African Americans from our state, who have influenced not just our country but the world. I’m pleased the Senate has passed this resolution recognizing Black History Month.
Enjoyed my visit with Nickie White with the MS National Guard Non-Commissioned Officer Association. I appreciate the work this organization does to ensure non-commissioned officers are well represented.
Combatting the #opioidepidemic more effectively will mean improving outreach to rural areas. The good news is that @UMMCnews @HHSgov/SAMHSA are making progress in Mississippi.  Discussed this issue at a hearing today.
I’ve introduced a bill to establish a unified framework for combatting chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer.  Mississippi is on the geographic eastern-leading edge of the spreading #CWD epidemic, which now affects at least 25 states.
Happy to support the confirmation of another Trump nominee.  Under @EPAAWheeler’s leadership, @EPAGov will continue to cut burdensome red tape while promoting balanced protection of the environment.
In honor of Rare Disease week,  I have joined the Rare Disease Congressional Caucus.  @RareAdvocates remains fervent in advocating for programming and research for patients dealing with rare illnesses. #RareDC2019

Appreciate the Mississippi Association of Broadcasters meeting with me to discuss policies that will help them best serve Mississippians. Happy to see this group committed to improving coverage and access for our state.
Filling American jobs with legal workers is important. The E-Verify system is an effective tool to maintain a legal workforce and reduce unauthorized employment.  E-Verify can also help ensure that individuals entering our country illegally aren’t rewarded for breaking the law.
Veterans hold a special place in my heart.  I’m always happy any chance I get to visit with them and hear their stories, especially as the @AmericanLegion celebrates its 100th anniversary.
We’re all moved in! Come by and visit us in Hart 702 anytime you’re in DC.
I saw a few familiar faces in this group today. We discussed the importance of maintaining a strong forestry industry in Mississippi.
It’s happening. We’re moving offices!
Tonight I voted to protect life. I’m ready to keep fighting until the Senate can agree on this issue. #BornAlive
Headed back to DC after a productive week of meetings with constituents, including this group from Southern Ag Credit and @MSLandBank. (pictured left to right: Joe Hayman, Kevin Rhodes, Reggie Allen, Craig Shideler)
Today the Senate will vote on @SenSasse’s bill protecting babies who survive attempted abortions. In these cases, healthcare practitioners should provide medical care to protect them. The choice to protect life shouldn’t be a partisan one.
Federal dollars shouldn’t be spent where abortions are performed. Happy to see @HHSGov moving forward with this final rule.
Congratulations Oxford High School on another regional @DOE_SC_NSB victory! Hope we get a chance to meet when you come to D.C. @OxfordSD #NSB2019
These are the kind of homecoming stories we’ve been waiting for. Thank you for your service and welcome home! @155ABCT | @dailyleader
In celebration of #NationalFFAWeek, I commend @MSFFA and @NationalFFA for the work they do to prepare our future leaders.
Thanks to Oxford Lafayette County Economic Development for the opportunity to visit with you about the economy, border security and my work in DC.
Today the @USCGReserve celebrates 78 years of readiness and assistance to the @USCG. Thank you for your continued sacrifice and service.
Presidents Day recognizes the contributions 45 Commanders in Chief have made to our nation. One of my favorites is President Reagan for his commitment to our military and economy. Who’s yours?
Great to have Clay County Sheriff Eddie Scott and his family, who were in D.C. to discuss public safety and border security w/@realdonaldtrump. This week, Congress also voted to increase funding for local law enforcement.
Great meeting with Mayor Flaggs and the Vicksburg delegation to learn more about the exciting developments coming to the city.
This week, I met with students and teachers from the Sacred Heart High School in Hattiesburg.  I always enjoy the opportunity to visit with groups like this one.
On her 199th birthday, we celebrate #SusanBAnthony’s contributions to the suffrage movement and her dedication to protecting the unborn.
Completing the FY19 funding bills will bring greater certainty to priority projects and programs in MS. The bill that doesn’t have everything @POTUS or I wanted, but the overall package funds physical barriers, law enforcement, and detention facilities to improve border security.
Roses are red. Violets are blue… the look you give when you think your crush is looking at you. #ValentinesDay #CaptionThis
I’m proud to have voted to confirm William P. Barr to be Attorney General. He will lead @TheJusticeDept with integrity and impartiality, which is what the American people expect and deserve.
It’s all about having heart, and @SOMississippi's Brooks Chance of Ridgeland has it.  Loved visiting with him, his mother and other #SpecialOlympics advocates this week.
Congrats on another successful test @NASAStennis.
77 percent of voters think babies who survive failed abortions should receive medical treatment.  Public policymakers should start thinking like
More and more Americans are optimistic about their personal finances as pro-growth policies boost the economy. Let’s keep growing!
It was an honor to say thank you to #GulfCorps for all its work.  Congrats and good luck to Corps Member of the Year, Jamine Poole!
Contact your local @usdafsa office for more information.
Pleased with Senate passage of @TimScott’s HBCU PARTNERS legislation. Mississippi’s strong HBCU system can benefit from a comprehensive strategy by federal agencies to engage and support these schools as they prepare new generations of students to reach their full potential.
Happy 320th birthday, Biloxi! We celebrate your long and colorful history—and your bright future as a gem on the Gulf Coast.
Happy the Senate approved this package. It is fitting that we offer a couple of additional days of duck hunting for servicemembers, veterans, and youth. It is a gesture of appreciation that can also generate additional economic activity in states where hunting is a way of life.
The Evers home has been integral in telling the story of this family’s pursuit of equality and justice during the civil rights movement. I look forward to the House of Representatives embracing this effort to honor the Evers and their work as part of Black History Month.
Appreciate the opportunity to talk with @NRA's @DLoesch on the GRIP Act and what Republicans need to do to keep the far left from implementing unreasonable gun laws. #2ndAmendment Watch here:

Congratulations to fellow @SouthernMiss alum Dr. Beverly Cotton of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians on being appointed new director of @IHSgov Nashville Area. Looking forward to your leadership and working with you. #SMTTT
My bill to protect #SecondAmendment rights has been referred to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. It would prohibit states from using federal money to track law-abiding gun owners.
Better watch out. Not knowing what’s in something has never stopped them before.
We remember the sacrifices made to build and advance America's space program. @NASA
Enjoyed speaking with HBCU leaders today, especially Dr. Lee of @AlcornStateU and Dr. Briggs of @MVSUDEVILS. HBCUs are an important part of our Mississippi institutions.
On his birthday, we remember President Ronald Reagan, a true example of service to God and country.
Federal law prohibits the government from tracking law-abiding gun owners that ban extends to using federal dollars on the local or state level. My bill would ensure local gun control schemes don’t wrongfully exploit federal resources to track.
Happy to see @USDA working to increase access to high-speed broadband in rural communities. Check out what they have to offer.



Glad to see Roy James, Plant Manager of Vicksburg Forest Products, will join @realDonaldTrump and @FLOTUS for #SOTU.  Yet another example of the benefits of Opportunity Zones and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
It’s shocking that anyone could condone late-term abortions. Thank you @SenSasse for pushing for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. I’m a cosponsor and we need to get this done.
On what would have been her 106th birthday, we remember Rosa Parks for her contributions to the civil rights movement.
.@USDOL is recognizing businesses for putting our veterans to work. I encourage Mississippi businesses that hire and retain veterans to apply to the 2019 #HIREVets program.
Plenty to talk about at @BeefUSA #CattleCon19 with the new #FarmBill and what it does to meet the needs of domestic producers.
Happy to be represented as the @FHLBDallas and @BankPlus support local nonprofit projects in MS that can have lasting benefits for many people.  I applaud this effort.
It’s National #WearRedDay! Join @nih_nhlbi and @JHS_HeartStudy in raising awareness to prevent heart disease, which claims too many Mississippians. #HeartMonth
Mississippi benefits from Republican pro-growth policies. Continued growth will increase the 11,000 jobs already added in our state since the historic tax package was passed in 2017.
Happy to cosponsor @SenCoryGardner's  bill to expand training track programs to encourage more doctors to perform their residencies in rural areas. This could have long-term benefits for rural MS
Thank you @SenJoniErnst for your leadership. I’m happy to cosponsor this bill. It shouldn't take a law to emphasize the protection of our citizens is a priority for any federal agency, especially in cases of illegal immigrants committing serious crimes.
Enjoyed my conversation with @PYNance of @CWforA.  We discussed the role of conservative women in the 116th Congress and some of my work in the U.S. Senate. Listen here:
See their rankings here:                                     
Nine Mississippi colleges universities have been recognized as military-friendly schools for their dedication to active military veterans who desire to pursue a secondary education.  I’m proud of these institutions that make our servicemembers a priority.
Last week, Mississippi received a $37.6 million federal grant for Head Start programs. Today I got a chance to meet w/ Eloise McClinton, Angela Mayfield, and Lille Smith to hear about the work they do with Institute of Community Services Head Start.
Great meeting with @GlennMcCJr and @JamieMillerMS to hear about economic development in Mississippi.
.@YouthBuildUSA offers youth opportunities to advance their education and gain valuable workplace skills. I'm pleased @USDOL sees the need to continue offering opportunities to more youth in the Mississippi


.@USDOL reports show #Mississippi has gained 11,000 more jobs since the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Evidence that this plan is helping to grow our economy.
Pleased to cosponsor @SenJohnThune's bill to repeal the "death tax". So much of the American economy is based on the success of small businesses, and the death tax only serves to suppress the continuity of too many farms and small businesses. 
ICYMI:  I launched my official Facebook page. Don't forget to like and follow
Groundbreaking for a new @NationalGuardMS​ Readiness Center in Nesbit, MS, @DeSotoCountyMS,​ which will modernize and improve military training for the brave men women who volunteer to protect us.

I’m thrilled the Okhissa Lake provision was enacted into law. The 2018 Farm Bill sets the stage for us to pursue the full potential of this wonderful asset. Really good opportunity for Southwest MS and our state.
Happy to see the progress on the new children’s barn at @MSAgMuseum
The Fannie Lou Hamer Cancer Foundation is doing important work to combat cancer death rates in the Mississippi Delta.  Enjoyed meeting with Foundation representatives this week.
Here’s my statement on the agreement to reopen the government.
Directing revenue from tariffs imposed on Chinese products to border security would ensure resources are available to enforce current law. This is a reasonable use of tariff monies and gets us past the argument over who is paying for border barriers and other security upgrades.
HYDE-SMITH PROPOSES USING TARIFF REVENUES TO FUND BORDER BARRIERS
Disappointed with failed vote to reopen the government AND secure the border. I’ve introduced a bill that could help us reach a solution.
RT @SenateGOP: While Republicans work to re-open the government, Democrats continue to play politics instead of compromising.
The Senate votes today on ending the government shutdown. One vote on a compromise bill the President will sign. Another on a plan he won’t. I’ll vote for the compromise to get 800k people back to work AND secure the border.
My field staff was on hand for the @FamiliesFirstMS family resource center grand opening in Calhoun City. Thank you Vardaman Mayor James Casey, Bruce Mayor Rudy Pope, Calhoun City Mayor Amye Hill, the late Pittsboro Mayor Reda Bullard for supporting this good endeavor.
Look forward to working with you and the @EnergyGOP.
RT @SenateGOP: Democrats were for border security…until @realdonaldtrump took office. Now they’ve shut down the government to stop @POTUS…
On this #MLKDayOfService, may we all find ways to serve our neighbors with hearts of grace and love.
Appreciate @realdonaldtrump offering something to bring Democrats to the table to end the #shutdown. Will they now work in good faith to get everyone back to work? It should.
I am truly proud of @March_for_Life as it raises awareness of the sanctity of life. #ProLife
In the nearly 50 years since Roe v Wade, there has been a valiant and ongoing fight to protect innocent lives, and establishing a permanent ban on using taxpayer dollars would be a significant step forward.
As a cosponsor of @SenBillCassidy bill to stop states from circumventing the law to offer Medicaid benefits to illegal immigrants, I’m working to protect states, like Mississippi, that follow the law and dedicate Medicaid resources to their citizens. 
Great to be with friends at a @SBAList event tonight.  We're all working for policies that promote life. #prolife
Day 26:  Resolving the shutdown will require good-faith negotiations by the Democrats, who supported border fencing and barriers in the past. @realdonaldtrump wants to accelerate this process to get operational control of the border. I support this goal.
Pleased to have my Appropriations subcommittee assignments. Look forward to working with Chairman @SenShelby and my colleagues to pass responsible spending bills.
In celebration of the centennial of the American Farm Bureau Federation, I cosponsored Sen. @JerryMoran's resolution to recognize and applaud the important work the @FarmBureau and @MSFB have done for the agriculture industry in Mississippi and across the nation.
RT @SenateGOP: Why do we need border security? This is why. These are the facts. #SecureOurBorder
It was a great pleasure to have @USArmy Major Paul Bankston working in my office last year as a defense legislative fellow. His insights and dedication to duty and service were a true benefit to Mississippi and our nation.
