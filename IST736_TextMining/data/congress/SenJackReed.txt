The Senate could quickly end the #TrumpShutdown If Senate Republicans simply allow an up or down vote on re-opening the gov’t. A clean CR could pass with strong bipartisan support. Pres Trump should stop pouting encourage his party to vote instead of just shutting down gov’t.
Democrats support smart #bordersecurity a whole of gov’t approach to public safety. Trump’s demand for ‘wall or nothing’ is making our country less safe wasting billions. Republicans should put protecting Americans above protecting Trump and allow Congress to vote.
