The number of incarcerated Nevada women has gone up 39% in the last 10 years. My staff attended the CSN Women’s Alliance Status of Women Symposium to look at the facts surrounding criminal justice reform for women.
My staff and I had the chance to sit down with members of @NVNACO this week to discuss important issues affecting Nevada’s counties including protections for Nevada’s public lands and funding for PILT.
.@mendozadinos Elementary School’s after school tutoring program is doing great work to benefit at risk students. I’m committed to doing all I can in Congress to support funding for programs such as the 21st CCLC to help our students succeed in school! #AfterSchoolWorks
NEVADA: Yesterday was #InternationalWomensDay, please take some time to nominate an extraordinary Nevada woman in #STEM using this link &gt;&gt;&gt; Together, we can break down barriers and build a gender-balanced world! #IWD2019
Congratulations to @HonorFlightNV on being named finalists for the Congressional Medal of Honor Society’s 2019 Citizens Honors Award. You make our state proud!
My team attended a reception with the Consul General of Canada in Carson City. Thank you, @GovSisolak, for hosting and thank you @CanCGLA for reinforcing Nevada and Canada’s strong trading and tourism relationship.
I stopped by @SenateYouth’s reception to present certificates to Morgan Heath-Powers and Jack Heinemann, two outstanding students chosen to represent the great state of NV. Teaching students to be more civic minded helps to build a better community, state, and nation! #USSYP2019
Today, my team joined #GrupoMujeres for a powerful discussion on the history of #InternationalWomensDay and to celebrate all the women in our community who are leading by example.
Each year, tens of thousands of visitors come to our state to experience the natural beauty of our public lands and monuments. I’m grateful for the chance to meet with environmental advocates today on how we can work together to conserve our state’s public lands.
My staff stopped by @Tesla’s #gigafactory1 today during their #WomenInTesla celebration of #IWD2019. I applaud their work to help female students get involved in #STEM and ensure that they have equal access to #STEMcareers, something I have also been working on in Washington.
The women of NASA portrayed in the film #HiddenFigures were pioneers for women in #STEM. I’m supporting the Hidden Figures Congressional Gold Medal Act to honor the incredible contributions of these women to our nation and future generations. #WomenInSTEM
I’ve joined 44 Senators to introduce legislation to restore #NetNeutrality. The internet should belong to the American people, not corporations. #SaveTheNet
What a great way to celebrate #InternationalWomensDay! NASA’s first all-female spacewalk is… out of this world!
On this #InternationalWomensDay, I’d like to remind Nevadans to head over to &gt;&gt;&gt; and take time to nominate extraordinary Nevada women working hard to break barriers in a #STEM field! #IWD2019
Dr. Christianne Yung, M.D. is an accomplished rheumatologist and one of only two doctors at @StRoseHospitals Rose de Lima Campus specializing in rheumatology. She also speaks multiple languages! Thank you for all you do to serve patients in Nevada! #WomenInSTEM
As a woman who started her career in computer programming, I know we need to do more to close the gender gap in science tech. That’s why each month I will highlight women in NV who are doing amazing things in STEM. To nominate a #WomenInSTEM click here:
Happy #InternationalWomensDay! I’m working in Congress to improve women’s access to #STEM education, by leveling the playing field to pursue #STEM education and careers and thus creating a more equal and innovative world.
My bill will require a study and Congressional hearing on alternative uses for Yucca that would create jobs. I’ll continue to listen to Nevadans who overwhelmingly oppose this reckless plan to turn our state into a dumping ground for other states’ nuclear waste.
ICYM: Stop by the Consumer Fraud Prevention Fair TODAY at Nevada State Business Center between 10am PT - 3pm PT to learn how to protect yourself against fraud. #NCPW19 For more information visit:
Renewing and protecting TPS is important for countless vulnerable communities. By granting #TPS to Venezuelans seeking refuge from the violent Maduro regime, we can help alleviate the suffering of innocent civilians.
.@SecNielsen: “The whole purpose of [the policy] was to increase consequences for those who choose to break the law.” Let's be clear: @DHSgov knew very well that “increasing consequences” meant tearing children from their families.
I introduced the bipartisan #JobsNotWasteAct because Nevadans have said loud clear that we do not want nuclear waste in our backyard. Yucca Mountain is unsafe a complete waste of hard-earned taxpayer money. It’s time to find smart, job-creating alternative uses for this site.
RENO! Don’t forget about TODAY’S Family Health Festival at Sparks Middle School from 3pm PT - 6pm PT! My staff will be there to answer any questions you may have on the services my offices offer including if you need help with a federal agency.
Let’s be clear: universal background checks will save lives and 97% of Americans support this commonsense legislation. That’s why I’m joining @ChrisMurphyCT in urging @LindseyGrahamSC to hold a hearing on expanding background checks.
This #WomensHistoryMonth, let's take some time to honor Sarah Winnemucca. Sarah was an author and an advocate for the rights and well-being of Native Americans and paved the way for a more civil society.
During today’s @HSGAC hearing, I asked whether the Office of Personnel Management had the resources to effectively address mission-critical skills gaps in the federal workforce.
My staff had the pleasure of attending Reno’s Lovelock Lions Club Annual Rural/Urban Nite Dinner to take part in celebrating our Northern Nevada communities.
There are too many unanswered questions regarding this Administration’s child separation policy. The incoming @DHSgov Inspector General needs to clearly commit to investigating these horrific allegations. We need a transparent recount of how this harmful policy got instituted.
I applaud @AaronDFordNV and the State of Nevada for joining in the fight to protect women’s access to health care. I will continue working in Congress to defend women’s health services.
.@SenCortezMasto and I really enjoyed welcoming Nevadans visiting the Hill this morning at our weekly Washington coffee! For more information on upcoming coffees, please reach out to my office by visiting
I’m co-sponsoring @SenMarkey’s resolution to restore #netneutrality because our students, small businesses, and hard-working families depend on a free and fair internet. I will continue the fight to restore net neutrality protections for all.
This week, I joined @maziehirono’s resolution calling on the Administration to defend the ACA because the protections that the Affordable Care Act provides are critical to ensuring access to health care for countless Nevadans.
There have been serious allegations of improper interference in the decision-making process surrounding the termination of #TPS for thousands of people. The @DHSgov Inspector General must investigate if there was any political motivation behind this wrongful decision. #TPSJustice
.@UNLV students and alumni! Don’t forget, @UNLV is hosting its annual Spring Job Fair TODAY from 10am PST - 3pm PST in the Student Union! For more information, please visit &gt;&gt;&gt;
We made a promise to take care of our veterans when they come back home. The #HireStudentVeteransAct is one way we can assist our veterans in finding gainful employment and good-paying jobs.
In Nevada, women on average make $8,645 less than men. In the #AAPI community that gap is twice as large. This kind of wage discrimination affects all communities in Nevada and we must work together to bridge this gap. #CloseTheWageGap
As a founding member of the bipartisan Palliative Care Task Force in the House last Congress, I’m committed to finding ways to improve care for those in need. Today I met with @NHPCO_news to discuss how we can improve care for those with serious illnesses.
I’m glad to see @NVNACO in DC this week advocating for PILT funding on behalf of Nevada. I’ll continue working alongside our counties so they can provide critical services, including emergency services, education, transportation, infrastructure, across our state.
The women of Hidden Figures were pioneers in #STEM. I’m proud to join @ChrisCoons @lisamurkowski and @SenKamalaHarris to honor them with the Hidden Figures Congressional Gold Medal Act.
UNLV students and alumni! Tomorrow @UNLV will be hosting its annual Spring Job Fair at the Student Union from 10am PST - 3pm PST. For more info visit:
Mr. Readler signed onto a brief attempting to strip ACA’s protections for those with pre-existing conditions. His views on our nation’s health care law is deeply troubling. For that reason, I’m voting against his nomination for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals.
I’ll continue fighting in every way I can to stop any attempt to revive Yucca Mountain.
I joined @SenCortezMasto, @RepDinaTitus, @RepHorsford, and @RepSusieLee in introducing the Nuclear Waste Informed Consent Act. This legislation ensures that the federal government cannot make Nevada the nation’s nuclear dumping ground without our consent.
My staff attended an informative Consumer Fraud Prevention Fair in Reno hosted by Nevada Consumer Affairs. For more information on ways to avoid falling victim to fraud, visit &gt;&gt;&gt; consumerhelp@business.nv.gov
My staff attended the grand opening of @SHHospitalLV’s new behavioral health unit. Providing affordable, quality health care to Nevadans is my top priority and this new health unit is a step in the right direction!
The rising cost of health care is a serious concern for many Nevada families and small businesses. I joined my Senate freshmen colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter urging Senate Leaders to take bipartisan action to prevent future cost hikes.
Congratulations to Harold from Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge in Nevada for being awarded this year’s National Wildlife Refuge Association Volunteer of the Year! #NevadaProud
Have you changed jobs recently? Are you newly married or a new parent? @NVHealthLink wants you to know that open enrollment is still available year-round for those with a qualifying life event. Find more information by visiting &gt;&gt;&gt;
I spoke with experts on ways Congress can work to bridge gaps in protecting our national electric grid from cyber attacks and other threats at this week’s @HSGAC roundtable.
Countless Nevadans who suffer from ALS are burdened by long waiting periods to access disability benefits. I’m proud to join my colleagues on the ALS Disability Insurance Access Act, a bipartisan bill to help provide relief by cutting the waiting period for those fighting ALS.
While I’m glad that @DHSgov finally complied with a court order and will briefly extend #TPS for hundreds of thousands of people, this is simply not enough. I will continue fighting for comprehensive immigration reform because we need permanent bipartisan solutions.
I applaud @GovSisolak for making education and access to quality health care a top priority. This $900,000 grant will greatly benefit @UNLV in helping expand their nursing program and address the medical shortage facing Nevada.
Nevada is home to a growing data storage industry. At a recent @SenateCommerce hearing about federal data privacy, I asked about the steps being taken to secure data-storage facilities from attacks.
I’ve met with organizations like @W4WNV and @RebelVETS on how we can help veterans find good-paying jobs. I’m confident that my common sense #HireStudentVeteransAct will put student vets on a pathway towards
.@SecretaryPerry and @ENERGY officials’ claims are deceptive and wrong. Nevada’s elected officials were not properly informed about the plutonium shipment last year. It’s time for them to work with @GovSisolak and the Congressional delegation to regain our trust.
RT @Mitch_Fox: Thank you @SenJackyRosen for meeting with @NVBroadcasters and for supporting local broadcasters throughout #Nevada
At the release of the Point In Time Count results, Washoe County community leaders discussed the progress they’ve made in fighting youth homelessness. Organizations like @nyep do incredible work to change lives and I’m proud to partner with them on tackling this important issue.
I applaud the House for passing a bill to expand background checks and hope Senate Leadership will give us a chance to vote on this package. I’ll continue to stand with the majority of Americans who support these reforms to keep our children, families, and communities safe.
Happy #ReadAcrossAmericaDay. What book are you going to read to your children tonight?
In honor of #WomensHistoryMonth, I read an excerpt of Turning Pages: My Life Story, a book written by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. This book teaches our children to be fearless in pursuit of their dreams, no matter their circumstances, background, or obstacles.
Books are key to unlocking a solid education and it’s important that we do all we can to help introduce our children to the joys of reading at an early age. It was a pleasure to join the students @ClarkCountySch’s Bartlett Elementary and take part in #NevadaReadingWeek! #1ForKids
This #WomensHistoryMonth we celebrate the countless contributions that women make to all facets of our society including the arts, athletics, science, math, entertainment, business, technology, military service, and politics.
Far too many members of our communities are still not fully protected by our country’s current anti-discrimination laws. I’m helping introduce the Do No Harm bill, which will make clear that companies cannot discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
As #BlackHistoryMonth comes to a close, let’s also pay tribute to the millions of Black veterans who have sacrificed so much to keep our nation safe. Thank you for your service to our country!
I’m proud to see @UNLV take the incredibly important task of documenting and recognizing the legacy and contributions of our Latinx community to Nevada and in doing so, giving so many before us a voice.
Since arriving to Congress, I have worked to find ways to increase funding for college readiness programs such as TRIO. I applaud the Nevada Legislature for considering alternative ways to help our students find a path to college graduation.
Congratulations to @Unevadareno for being awarded a @NSF grant for nearly $400,000 to monitor and better understand climate change. This grant will fund research and innovation that will positively impact Nevada. To learn more, visit:
I’m cosponsoring the #ChildCareforWorkingFamiliesAct because it's time for us to give hard-working Nevada families access to quality, affordable child care. #ChildCare4All
There’s no denying the facts -- the catastrophic effects of climate change are real, and things will get worse if we don’t act. That’s why I'm co-sponsoring @SenatorCarper's resolution because Congress should take immediate action to address this crisis.
Mr. Wheeler has done nothing to ease my concerns about his lack of commitment to environmental protections and the well-being of Nevadans. I voted NO on his nomination to head the @EPA.
Honored to receive the esteemed Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the U.S. Eagle Award for my work to expand affordable health coverage for Guardsmen and Reservists who serve as civilian federal employees. I’ll continue to work across the aisle to support our heroes.
The #ChildCareforWorkingFamiliesAct would help families avoid having to choose between working to effectively provide for their family or staying home to care for a child by providing access to high-quality child care that is affordable. #ChildCare4All
We made a promise to veterans that they will be taken care of when they come back home. I’m keeping that promise by introducing the #HireStudentVeteransAct as my first piece of legislation.
By introducing the #HireStudentVeteransAct as my first piece of legislation, I am committing to helping Nevadans who have bravely served our country.
Estoy orgullosa de mi historial como defensora del futuro de energía limpia de NV y de las tierras públicas. Continuaré defendiendo nuestro legado de conservación. #LCVScorecard

Immensely proud to recognize @unevadareno @UNLV’s incredible achievement in the designation of R-1 Research Institution by Carnegie Commission on Higher Ed. My staff was ecstatic to present both @PresMarcJohnson @UNLV_President with certificates this month. #NevadaProud
In just the last few decades, the number of women in #STEM has dropped dramatically nationwide. I’m working to break barriers and introduce more young girls to #STEMeducation to help open doors for their future.
Pursuing an education, at any age, opens doors to a successful future. My team toured @NNVLiteracyCncl facilities and met with staff to learn more about their mission of helping adults learn and achieve their educational goals.
Reports of the Maduro administration burning aid and supplies intended for the people of Venezuela is deeply disturbing. The U.S. should never be prevented from providing humanitarian aid to those in need.
I was honored to speak @UNLVTheCenter’s #TRIOGUDay to celebrate the excellent work that programs like UNLV TRIO and GEAR UP provide to nearly 26,000 Nevada students. I pledge my continued support for these programs because they help Nevada students succeed.
Women everywhere have the right to make their own medical decisions, in consultation with their doctor, not a politician. S.311 is another attack on a woman’s right to choose. For that reason, I voted no.
As my first piece of legislation as a Senator, I’m introducing the bipartisan #HireStudentVeteransAct, to help our student veterans find paid internships using their GI benefits. I’m confident this commonsense legislation will put our student vets on the pathway towards success.
I’m proud to introduce the #HireStudentVeteransAct, a bipartisan bill that will help our student veterans find paid internships jobs while in school. I’ll continue to listen to NV’s veteran community fight to ensure their voices are heard in Congress.
200,000+ veterans call Nevada home. As my first piece of legislation, I’m introducing the #HireStudentVeteransAct – bipartisan legislation to incentivize businesses to hire our student veterans who are using their GI benefits to study.
Protecting Nevada’s seniors is a top priority of mine and as a member of @DemsOnAging, I’m looking for ways to improve their access to health care. My staff attended #SeniorIssuesDay at #NVLeg to hear from and connect with Nevada’s senior citizen community.
This #BHM we remember trail blazers like Shirley Chisholm who became the first black woman elected to the U.S. Congress in 1968 and first woman to run for president. Decades later, Congresswoman Chisholm continues to inspire us all.
I’m co-sponsoring the Raise the Wage Act because Nevada’s hardworking families shouldn’t have to work full time and still live in poverty. It is time to raise our federal minimum wage in a way that makes sense for everyone.
This Administration’s misguided decision to implement a gag rule on #TitleX hurts the 4 million + women and their families who rely on it for care, and puts communities of color at risk of losing access to health care altogether.
I’m heading to Yucca Mountain next week to make sure my colleagues hear Nevadans’ voices loud and clear. Home means Nevada and I will not allow our state to become the nation’s dumping ground for nuclear waste.
.@librarycongress is collecting the stories of those who have served this nation for their Veterans History Project and they are seeking firsthand servicemember accounts in an effort to preserve history. For more information, visit &gt;&gt;

I sat down with Northern Nevada health care leaders for a roundtable to discuss how we can continue to work together to improve access to quality, affordable health care. Health care will continue to be my top priority because if we don’t have our health, we don’t have anything.
I’m proud to donate my salary from the shutdown to exceptional organizations, like the Domestic Violence Resource Center of Reno, which are working to help survivors of sexual domestic violence. I will continue working in Congress to create a safer country for women everywhere.
Great meeting with the owners of @BiboCoffeeCo, one of Reno’s many incredible small businesses. As a member of @SenateSmallBiz, I will continue to find ways to provide Nevada’s small businesses with the tools they need to succeed.
I had the pleasure of sitting down with a group of trailblazing women yesterday to discuss the incredible work they’re doing to uplift the Reno community. I look forward to partnering and working alongside these inspiring women for many years to come!

The 100 Black Men of Las Vegas held a gala last night to honor extraordinary women in Nevada. I’m thrilled to work in Congress to help empower women who are breaking barriers and improving our communities.
I joined my colleagues to support the Employer Participation in Repayment Act. This bill will make it easier for young borrowers to work with their employers to relieve their student debt, and will allow businesses to offer employer-provided loan assistance as a benefit.
Fighting homelessness takes a multifaceted approach and I applaud @CCharitiesUSA for working to reduce chronic homelessness in Nevada.
I joined @RonWyden and @SenCortezMasto in sending a letter to @forestservice to look into how the President’s shutdown harmed their ability to operate, train, hire, and improve wildfire resiliency work.
This President’s Day, let’s honor those who have led our country with wisdom and the courage of their convictions.
Chinatown Plaza held their 25th Annual Chinese New Year celebration to commemorate the #YearOfTheBoar. My team was excited to be there to help celebrate with #AAPI community organizations like @ACDCNV! 新年快樂!
I will not stand on the sidelines while women’s reproductive rights are attacked. I will continue to stand up, fight, and defend a woman’s right to choose.
I’m joining @SenDuckworth’s Korematsu-Takai Civil Liberties Protection Act to ensure that our country never again allows the cruelty that was imposed on the Japanese American community during WWII.
The @EPA’s job is to preserve our environment and protect citizens from environmental health risks. By refusing to fulfill their most essential responsibilities, they’re endangering the health of countless communities.
Maggie, a member of my Las Vegas team, participated in @LasVegasACC’s Gala to celebrate community leaders who are working hard to improve southern Nevada’s economy. Happy #ChineseNewYear!

I applaud the Nevada Legislature and @GovSisolak for taking an important step towards ending the senseless gun violence epidemic. This common sense legislation will close a big loophole in our background check
Let’s be clear: there is no justification for declaring a national security emergency at the border. This is no way to govern. We need smart, bipartisan solutions and leadership to address this humanitarian crisis --  not an ineffective wall that will cost taxpayers billions.
The President declaring a national emergency to circumvent Congress is reckless and wrong. I do not support his unilateral decision that undermines Congress and our co-equal branches of government.
This #AmericanHeartMonth, I encourage Nevadans to engage in heart-healthy activities and make heart health a priority.  #HeartMonth
While I’m relieved to see Congress pass a funding deal that keeps the government open, there is no justification for the President to declare a national emergency at the border. This reckless move to circumvent Congress will only set a dangerous precedent.
Without the ACA’s protections, millions could lose access to life-saving coverage. That’s why I could not support Barr’s nomination.
The Attorney General’s job is to defend our nation’s laws. I have strong concerns over Mr. Barr’s hostility to laws protecting women’s reproductive rights and his refusal to commit to upholding the constitutionality of the ACA.
@unlv’s @RebelVETS program assists our nation’s heroes as they pursue a higher education. I was honored to meet with them to discuss steps we can take to help our veterans transition back to civilian life after their service.
Estoy comprometida a proteger el #TPS porque los beneficiarios del TPS son una parte esencial de nuestra comunidad. Ellos viven, trabajan, van a la escuela y pagan impuestos y sus contribuciones hacen que Nevada y nuestro país sea más fuerte. #SaveTPS
I’m fighting to #ProtectTPS because TPS holders are an essential part of our communities. They live, work, go to school, and pay taxes, and their contributions only make Nevada and our country stronger. #SaveTPS
Nevadans deserve access to affordable, high-quality health care, and that’s exactly what the State Public Option Act would offer. Read my full statement here &gt;&gt;&gt;
1 year ago, a devastating school shooting left the Parkland community and the country grief-stricken. Nevadans know all too well the pain of our nation’s gun violence epidemic. We must stand strong by passing meaningful reform that saves lives.

The Las Vegas Paiute Tribe came by my office to talk about ways to support Nevada’s growing cannabis industry.
Productive meeting with members of the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe yesterday. We discussed economic development and how we can protect access to healthcare for Nevada’s tribal communities.
Public lands support our vibrant outdoor recreation economy and create thousands of jobs in Nevada. I will continue to stand in support of legislation that protects our public lands so that future generations can continue to enjoy them. #LWCF #PublicLands
I voted yes on the #PublicLands package - this bill will preserve and allow access to public lands, and will benefit Storey, Lincoln White Pine Counties. Our public lands are a source of natural wonder and hold historical significance for the Silver State.
Excited to welcome @Google to Henderson! Their new data center will bring good-paying jobs to the valley, helping transform and diversify Nevada’s growing tech economy.
26 years ago, FMLA transformed the workplace. Now it’s time to put an end to making our workers choose between their livelihoods and taking care of themselves or a loved one. That is why I’m supporting the #FAMILYAct - it’s time to provide workers #PaidLeave.

Abraham Lincoln was born 210 years ago today. In 1858, Lincoln famously declared that “A House divided against itself cannot stand.” Over 160 years later, those wise words still ring true. We must remain united and work together for a more perfect union.
Los recibidores de #TPS hacen valiosas contribuciones en Nevada y en toda nuestra nación. Aplaudo la decisión de @AaronDFord de proteger a todos los que tienen TPS en Nevada.
#TPS recipients make invaluable contributions in Nevada and across our nation every day. I applaud @AaronDFord’s decision to protect our TPS recipients in the Silver State.
Sex trafficking will only continue to grow as a problem if we fail to address it. I’m glad to see local law enforcement is making progress on this issue by teaming up with agencies across Las Vegas to combat sex trafficking in Nevada.
The Presidents’ shutdown worsened an already backlogged immigration court system. 800,000 hearings won't be rescheduled until 2022. This only put strain on our immigration system, affecting hundreds of thousands of immigrants seeking asylum.
Programs like @GEARUPNV are essential for underrepresented students in Nevada and across the country who are working towards achieving a higher education. I will continue to support programs that open doors for our students so that they can access a better and brighter future.
Thank you #TeamLee for being there to support Blake on his distinguished accomplishment!
Thank you for the kind words #TeamHorsford! We are very lucky to have Blake.
This weekend, my team attended @NVMuseums’ Chinese New Year Celebration in Carson City with members of Nevada’s AAPI community to help ring in the #YearOfThePig!

Today is International #WomenInScienceDay! I’m proud to help break barriers for women in science. Let’s work to inspire young girls to pursue a #STEM education.
Congratulations to Nevada’s own Peyton Barsel and Jackson Bentham! They were both selected as Nevada’s distinguished finalists for The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards for their outstanding volunteerism. Keep up all the great work!
This President’s shutdown occurred at the busiest time of the year for Nevada’s public parks. As a result, our public lands paid the price with trash and vandalism damaging our natural beauty.
Israel is our country's closest ally, in part because of our shared values of democracy and common strategic interests. With anti-Semitic attacks on the rise, peddling hateful and ugly tropes of anti-Semitism is wrong and must be called out.
Countless people living with a pre-existing condition depend on protections guaranteed under the ACA. I will continue fighting so that Nevadans and Americans across our nation have access to quality, affordable care.
Congratulations to all the men and women who became citizens at Friday’s naturalization ceremony in Reno! Immigration makes our country stronger. I’m proud to represent such a diverse state.
Nevada! Please be sure to check out my new website for any meeting requests, flag requests, help with a federal agency, and more! �

I applaud @USDOTFHWA for awarding Nevada Department of Transportation grants to fund much-needed infrastructure projects. I will continue to reach across the aisle and look for bipartisan ways to improve Nevada’s infrastructure.
This Administration’s unnecessary shutdown put the stability of millions of small businesses across the nation at risk. As a member of @SenateSmallBiz, I’m working to find ways to help Nevada small businesses and our economy thrive.
Congratulations to the staff at @RenoAirport for their hard work! More visitors means more tourism and that strengthens our local economy. I will continue to support legislation to make Nevada’s airports safer and more efficient.
I’m supporting the ANTIQUITIES Act because we must stand up and protect Nevada’s natural wonders so that future generations can enjoy our public lands. #MonumentsForAll
My staff attended the Sri Lanka Independence day celebration in Las Vegas and recognized the outstanding contributions made by Nevada’s Sri Lankan community.
Today, I attended the Spring Festival in Las Vegas to celebrate the #LunarNewYear. Happy #YearOfThePig!
Tearing children from their parents’ arms goes against everything our great nation stands for. I’ll continue to hold this Administration accountable support legislation, such as the #KeepFamiliesTogether Act, to ensure this cruelty stops.
I applaud Nevada’s Attorney General @AaronDFordNV’s court filling. @ENERGY’s unilateral decision to ship dangerous weapons grade plutonium to Nevada in secret demands accountability.
I joined @SenCortezMasto in sending a bipartisan letter to @SeemaCMS to encourage the Administration to improve the stability and predictability of its Medicare Advantage program. Thousands of seniors across Nevada depend on this program.
My staff had the opportunity to tour the Veterans Benefits Administration in Reno. I’m looking forward to working closely with the VA to help serve our veterans. Please contact my office for any assistance you may need with the VA.
Congratulations to our very own Blake Boles on being awarded Veteran of the Month by the Nevada Department of Veterans Services. Blake does incredible work in my office and I’m thankful for all he does to serve our veterans in Nevada!
Relieved to see that the critical position of U.S. Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat #AntiSemitism is no longer vacant. I worked in both the House and the Senate in order to see this role filled. This is a step in the right direction in combating anti-Semitism.
In Nevada across the country, the poor conditions in our schools jeopardize the health safety of students in the classroom. I’m co-sponsoring the Rebuild America’s Schools Act because we can’t expect to educate our kids when their schools are falling apart.

As a former computer programmer, I understand first-hand the importance of #NetNeutrality. I will continue fighting to ensure Nevada’s hardworking families and small businesses have access to a free and fair internet.
RT @NASA: #NASARemembers ��Today, we pause to reflect on the legacy of the women and men who gave their lives advancing the frontiers of…
The repercussions of the President’s shutdown caused negative effects across the country, including right here in Nevada where SNAP programs were disrupted. We need to ensure that another shutdown does not happen.
This Administration will stop at nothing to sabotage our health care system. I applaud @GovSisolak and @AaronFordNV for standing up and fighting for Nevadans’ access to quality affordable health care.

Congressman John Dingell’s countless accomplishments and legacy as the longest-serving member of Congress will always be remembered. My thoughts are with his wife, @RepDebDingell, and all of his family and friends during this difficult time.
We must fight to protect our #NationalMonuments. That’s why today I helped introduce the ANTIQUITIES Act. Nevada's natural beauties are part of our cultural heritage and I stand ready to defend our national monuments for generations to come. My full statement here &gt;&gt;&gt;
Thank you @JonahPesner for your spiritual guidance with this reading. We need to hold ourselves accountable and make sure that our policies, practices, and behaviors reflect the sacred values of justice and compassion.
I was honored to speak at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning. I read a passage from Isaiah chapter 58. By building interfaith bridges, we can find common ground, and work together for the American people.
This week, we celebrate #NationalSchoolCounselingWeek to recognize the immeasurable impact school counselors have on our children’s education and career success. Take a moment to thank your local counselor today. Happy #NSCW19!
At yesterday’s @CityofReno State of the City address, @MayorSchieve discussed her plans to help make Nevada a national leader in tech. I’ll continue to listen to the needs of our constituents and local governments to ensure we’re doing all we can to strengthen Nevada’s economy.
.@ENERGY must provide clear answers about the unethical deceitful decision to ship dangerous, weapons grade plutonium to Nevada without our consent or knowledge. This reckless move may have endangered the health and safety of thousands of Nevadans.
In @SenateCommerce today, we discussed 5G the importance of broadband development in Nevada’s rural counties across the country. I’ll continue to support legislation that invests in #STEM education so that we have a strong, capable workforce to meet our technology demands.
We must act to produce a skilled 21st century workforce that strengthens our cybersecurity economy. My Legislative Assistant, Kelly Riddle, did an outstanding job at the @CompTIA panel. She discussed how I am working to address labor shortages in cyber through apprenticeships.
My full statement in response to the President’s #SOTU2019 here &gt;&gt;
This Administration's relentless attacks on women's reproductive rights is completely unacceptable. I stand with the majority of Nevadans who support defending a woman's right to choose. #SOTU
This President's repeated attempts to sabotage our health care system have put families across the country in jeopardy of not having access to care. People like my #SOTU guest Tanya, a 3x cancer survivor, depend on the ACA for survival.
Ending HIV is a noble goal I welcome the President’s plan reduce transmission by 2030. But let’s remember that this is the same Administration that has put PEPFAR funding, which has been extremely successful at reducing HIV infections, on the chopping block. #SOTU
Rising prescription drug costs are affecting Americans’ ability to afford life-saving medications and both sides of the aisle want to see immediate action. It's time to put the partisan games aside and work together to make prescription drugs more affordable. #SOTU
The President's role as Commander-in-Chief also includes uniting people, but he continues to divide us whenever he talks about his wall. The majority of Nevadans don’t support spending billions on a senseless wall. They want smart solutions to fix our broken immigration system.
The President is continuing to mislead the nation when it comes to immigration. He needs to look at the facts and then work on a real bipartisan immigration plan that will actually fix our broken immigration system. #SOTU
