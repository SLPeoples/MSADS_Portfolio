Sadly, Berta’s case is not an anomaly; it is a symptom of a much larger system of corruption. To see that this corruption is alive and well, you only have to look to the recent arrest of 12 environmental activists in retaliation for their protests.
While seven men who helped orchestrate the murder were recently convicted, many Hondurans are still wondering if the senior government and business figures involved in this assassination will ever face justice.
Saturday is the 3-year anniversary of indigenous leader Berta Cáceres’ brutal murder. Berta was killed because of her efforts to stop construction of a controversial hydroelectric dam on the Gualcarque river, which the Lenca people consider sacred.
The fight against Trump’s bogus “national emergency” declaration is moving to the Senate. Both sides need to come together to protect our country and our constitution from clear violations by the executive branch.
Thank you for your grassroots activism in support of the #GreenNewDeal. Continue to speak out fight for our future. The climate battle is far from over we need you more than ever. I’ll be alongside you each step of the way.

The depravity and breadth of the lies described by Michael Cohen are startling, even given what we know of @realDonaldTrump’s character.

.@Netanyahu’s embrace of an extremist racist fringe political party, Otzma Yehudit, is wrong and counterproductive. Just as in the U.S., hate has no place in Israeli politics. 
A president and a dictator met in Hanoi. One has demanded unquestioned loyalty, bragged about his nuclear arsenal, attacked the press, and employed family members as his advisors. The other is Kim Jong-un.

I support diplomatic efforts to denuclearize North Korea, but I have trouble trusting details to the president who blew up both the Iran deal and #INFTreaty. This is complex, and “complexity” is not Trump’s strong suit. This challenge won’t be solved by reality TV-style photo ops
“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing.” Shame on any Trump Administration officials who had the power to push back on this horrific child separation policy and stayed silent instead. #FamiliesBelongTogether

The Acting Administrator of the @EPA is a former coal industry lobbyist. And he’s acted like one since he’s been at the EPA.  We need an administrator who believes in the “P” part of the EPA’s mission.

No matter when this happened, sex abuse is NEVER ok. @RealDonaldTrump decision to defend Sec. Acosta and write off this despicable crime is a disgusting disregard for survivors everywhere.
Any withholding of the full #MuellerReport from Congress would be a deliberate move to conceal the truth. This injustice will not stand.
The Trump Admin’s new Title X gag rule is a shocking attack on women’s health. Millions of women access cancer screenings and other essential health care through @PPFA. Threatening that care to make a political point about abortion is horrific and wrong. #SaveTitleX

Trump’s absurd declaration of a “national emergency” undercuts the Constitution. Congress must act now to stop the President’s effort to redirect essential funding towards a worthless border wall. #NoWall
If AG Barr withholds any portion of the report, it will interfere with Congress’ ability to fulfill its constitutional role as a check on the executive. Congress must demand access to the ENTIRE Mueller report.
Last year, I stood with Dems on the Senate floor to acknowledge the legitimate pressing issue of climate change. In that year, @SenateMajLdr has still failed to even admit this crisis is real. Why is the GOP so proud to have their head in the tar sands? #GreenNewDeal

RT @humanrights1st: Must-read thread from @SenJeffMerkley's trip to the Northern Triangle �
Put another way—at the same time as the Trump administration is inflicting trauma on families at our border who are fleeing persecution, it is undermining anti-corruption anti-poverty efforts in Central America, causing MORE families to flee. That’s the wrong path for America.
In Guatemala, we’ve seen President Morales take these cues from the Trump administration—that human rights civil rights anti-corruption projects are a low priority—as permission to attack civil society and to undermine anti-corruption efforts like @CICIGgt.
The @realDonaldTrump administration is demanding billions of dollars to build a wall to lock up more asylum seekers, including children. But at the same time, they’ve proposed cutting aid to the #NorthernTriangle by 30%. Which is a better investment?
Overall, there continue to be tremendous security, corruption and economic challenges in the #NorthernTriangle. And the bottom line is that, until conditions improve, people will keep undertaking the harrowing journey to our border in search of any kind of hope.
In #ElSalvador, we were able to meet with President-Elect @NayibBukele. He expressed a strong desire to strengthen economic and cultural ties with the United States, and I’m optimistic about his incoming administration.
We also need a US Ambassador in Honduras. At a time when there is so much at stake in the region, it’s completely unacceptable that @realDonaldTrump has not nominated anyone to fill this key position.
In #Honduras, it’s clear that the anti-corruption commission @OEA_MACCIH must be allowed to continue its important work. For the people to have confidence in government institutions, they must be able to trust that decisions are not driven by corruption.
We also heard repeatedly about malnutrition, a significant and pressing challenge in #Guatemala. The US can and should do more to address this basic human need.
In #Guatemala, the US must do everything it can to ensure free and fair elections in June. Guatemalans need to be able to trust that their elected government represents the will of the people. Without addressing this fundamental issue, other problems will continue to fester.
Home now. Here are a few more thoughts from our fact-finding trip to the #NorthernTriangle. @SenatorCarper and I were able to visit all three nations—Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.
The GOP claims the #GreenNewDeal is farfetched unattainable because they are beholden to the Koch brothers. Our future is too important to be decided by special interests. We must rise up do everything in our power to save our homes, our businesses, our economy, our planet.
A Climate crisis is relentlessly eroding our quality of life. The #GreenNewDeal is a bold common-sense solution, not a radical dream. Our future is at stake. The truly crazy idea is that we should do nothing while our planet burns.
I’m incredibly proud of Oregon joining the list of those standing up for the American people and the rule of law. Trump’s emergency declaration is a dangerous attempt to subvert the separation of powers for his own political objectives.
Sure, it’s unusual to have the FBI launch a counterintelligence investigation against the President. But it’s pretty darn unusual to have a President who acts like an agent of a foreign government.
Calls to my office about @realDonaldTrump’s fake national emergency are running 24-1 against. Grassroots America: Keep it up! We need your voices to push back on this unlawful power grab.

Today on #PresidentsDay, we remember that our Founders were wise in creating a Democratic Republic where the PEOPLE have the POWER to vote out corruption. And November 2020 is coming.
The situation in the #NorthernTriangle is complex, many decades in the making, there is no silver bullet to solve it. But we can start by at least understanding where things have gone wrong, and where US policy can play a role. Stay tuned for more...
We also met with aid groups and small business leaders who are doing admirable work to lift up their fellow citizens and strengthen civil society.
In Guatemala, we met with President Jimmy Morales, urging him to uphold human rights, strengthen the rule of law, and rebuild citizens’ trust in their democracy government.
If we want to take on this migration crisis, we need to understand the root causes of the crisis. That’s why this weekend I traveled with @SenatorCarper and our House colleagues to see the facts on the ground.
The real emergency is not a wall at the Southern Border — it’s that conditions are so difficult and dangerous in the #NorthernTriangle countries that thousands of families are literally fleeing for their lives.
