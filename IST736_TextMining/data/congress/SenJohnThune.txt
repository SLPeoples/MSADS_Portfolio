Joined a few @mountmarty classes today to talk about policy and preparing to enter the workforce.

I’m incredibly fortunate to be surrounded by strong females in my wife, daughters, and granddaughter. They are a constant reminder of the future that we all need to fight for, one with greater security and opportunity for women here at home and throughout the world.  #IWD2019
Big weekend for South Dakota hoops. Excited to watch all South Dakota teams compete at the Summit. Here’s a fun fact – did you know @thesummitleague MVP @dauminator24's grandfather, Nick, was a multi-sport star in my hometown of Murdo? #JonesCountyPride @GoJacksMBB
.@SecAFOfficial has been a thoughtful leader as we have worked to restore military readiness. Most importantly, she has been an advocate for America’s #airmen and their families. Thank you for your service, Heather. Congratulations, and best wishes in TX.
$93 trillion is more money than the United States has spent in its entire history. It’s more money than the combined GDP of the entire world. But it’s what Democrats’ #GreenNewDeal could cost if they get their way.
Under the #GreenNewDeal, if you like your car, you probably won’t be able to keep it. If you like your health care, you probably won’t be able to keep it. If you like your house, you may not be able to keep that either.
The more you look at the #GreenNewDeal, the worse it looks.
My bipartisan #PHITAct would allow people to use a portion of the money saved in their HSAs and/or FSAs toward certain sports and fitness purchases, like gym memberships, fitness equipment, and youth sports league fees. More:

You know you’re onto something when attorneys general from all 50 states, plus D.C. and three U.S. territories, all agree on an issue. It’s time to crack down on illegal and abusive robocalls and pass my bipartisan TRACED Act.
America’s economy grew at a rate of 3.1% from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. That’s the strongest economic growth in over 10 years.
Great to visit with @SDState President Barry Dunn. We discussed the Wokini Initiative that was included in the 2018 #FarmBill. Looking forward to seeing him at the Summit League Tourney this weekend.

The 5th grade students at Laura B. Anderson Elementary in Sioux Falls were an impressive group. They were engaged and had great questions.

Visited with the folks at Hillman Plumbing and Heating this morning. Great example of a family-owned small business in Sioux Falls that has grown to provide dozens of jobs for the community.
America’s economy is booming. For the first time in 13 years, we have hit 3.1 percent economic growth during a calendar year.
The Senate just confirmed Andrew Wheeler to be the next EPA administrator. I look forward to continue working with him on the approval of year-round #E15 sales and to provide greater regulatory relief and certainty to the American people.
Honored to spend time with veterans from South Dakota’s @AmericanLegion today. Thank you all for your service!
It is horrifying that the Democrat Party can’t get up and say that infanticide is wrong. A baby born alive in an abortion clinic is no less valuable and deserving of protection than a baby born in a delivery room.
Google, a company that touts "transparency is a core value of our approach," must answer to Congress for failing to disclose to its consumers a hidden microphone on its Nest Secure product. See the letter I signed with other @SenateCommerce leaders here:
Democrats just rejected a bill to protect babies that survive a botched abortion. They have swung so far to the left that they cannot even bring themselves to affirm that babies born alive should be protected.
Tonight the Senate will vote on a common-sense measure that we all should be able to get behind — a bill that simply declares that any infant born alive during an abortion is entitled to be protected.
Mr. 3K, the @dauminator24, was on hand today for another barn burner between two of the nation’s best women’s’ hoops teams. Congrats to @gojackswbb and @sdcoyoteswbb on another epic overtime showdown. Bring on the Summit. #9alltime

Fiber broadband coming to my hometown. One of my top priorities is to see South Dakota become more connected, so this is great news.

Glad to join @MarkWarner in introducing a bill that would allow employers to offer tax-free student loan assistance to attract future career-seekers and help their employees pay off student loan debt. More ️
It’s important to strike the right balance that ensures public lands can be used for agriculture, outdoor recreation, and commercial interests alike, and I believe this bill is a step in the right direction.
As both a policymaker and someone who greatly enjoys the outdoors, I strongly support policies that preserve and protect our natural resources, especially those in South Dakota, for future generations to enjoy.
It also includes a separate proposal from the South Dakota congressional delegation that will provide the Custer County Airport with more opportunities at its facility.
I support the Natural Resources Management Act, which the Senate just passed. This bipartisan legislation is the result of more than 100 individual lands-related initiatives, including a proposal to reform and permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund.
Great to see @AjitPaiFCC today. Look forward to continuing the work of protecting internet innovation and improving connectivity for rural Americans.
The Democrats’ #GreenNewDeal is projected to cost American families up to $3,800 per year in higher energy bills, but that is just the beginning. WATCH ↓
On it, @SenTomCotton. Louie, I’ll help you check South Dakota off of your list. Sending prayers and good thoughts your way.
We can achieve a deal to avert another shutdown, but we can’t do it by jeopardizing law enforcement’s ability to protect the American people.
Instead of getting government out of your way, @SenateDems want to put government in charge of your health care, your electricity options, and more.
This so-called “#GreenNewDeal” could raise energy costs for families by more than $3,000 per year. We can’t let that happen.
While @SenateDems don’t seem concerned about raising costs or destroying jobs, they are concerned that their #GreenNewDeal won’t eliminate cow emissions and airplanes fast enough. I wish I were joking.
Having previously held this position, there’s no doubt that Bill Barr is qualified to serve once again as attorney general. I look forward to supporting his nomination when it comes before the full Senate.

Good meeting with @EPAAWheeler today to discuss #E15 and #WOTUS rewrite, both big wins for South Dakota. He recognizes the importance of getting the E15 rule done by summer driving season to deliver on @POTUS commitment to farmers.
Senate Democrats will have the opportunity to vote on @POTUS’s proposal to reopen the government. The bill we will vote on is a fair and reasonable proposal and a genuine compromise.
Having served on @HouseAgGOP, and now on @SenateAgGOP, I know what an honor it is to defend South Dakota’s ag community. Welcome to the committee, Dusty. Looking forward to working with you.

While it’s often a bipartisan effort, passing a farm bill is never an easy task, but it’s always worth the outcome. In this case, it means the agriculture community has greater economic certainty heading into the new year.
Farm bills and agriculture policy in general have historically been areas where Congress could come together and do the hard work America’s farmers and ranchers expect. This year was no different.
Any guesses? #FinalJeopardy
We need to fund the government, and a critical part of that funding is border security.
