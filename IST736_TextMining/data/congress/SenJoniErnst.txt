#ICYMI @FoxNews: Senators introduce 'Green Alert' legislation to establish nationwide notification system for missing veterans
Today, as part of #WomensHistoryMonth, I’m proud to recognize the first woman elected governor of #Iowa, my friend @IAGovernor! Gov. Reynolds has led our state to the lowest unemployment nationwide, strengthened workforce development, empowered our rural communities. #IowaWomen
This #WomensHistoryMonth, I’ll be highlighting #IowaWomen who have been trailblazers for women everywhere. Stay tuned!
That’s why I’m working closely with my Democratic colleague, @SenFeinstein, to modernize VAWA to fit the needs of our communities today. I’m committed to finding a truly bipartisan bill that will ensure that these critical services go to women who are desperately in need.
The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) provides desperately needed resources for programs that tackle domestic sexual abuse in our communities. However, Congress let this key bill expire. We must work together to reauthorize this critical piece of legislation.
As a combat vet, I know the challenges our servicemembers can face when they return home.As lawmakers, we have a responsibility to ensure our vets receive the support they are promised.My bipartisan bills will help our vets in crisis.
Covered a lot of issues during my mtg w/@INEDAssoc: trade, regulatory reform, infrastructure, workforce development. I'll continue to advocate for policies that put #Iowa farmers businesses first. Honored to receive their Legislative Leadership Award. Thx for all you do!
This #GreenNewDeal is a raw deal for your pocket book and a slam to rural America. Today on the #Senate floor I outlined exactly how unrealistic and outrageously costly this proposal truly is. WATCH:
We have a clear choice. We can continue to support rural America and pro-growth policies that boost our economy and create jobs, or we can allow socialist fantasies like the #GreenNewDeal to creep in, take hold, bankrupt our nation, devastate our rural communities.
From combines and fertilizers to trucks that transport grains to market, everything would be impacted. The #GreenNewDeal is unrealistic, and would unfairly impact rural communities across the country.
Our unemployment in #Iowa sits at a low 2.4%, and we have over 63,000 job openings and about 40,000 unemployed folks looking for work. That’s more job openings than people looking for jobs!
What may be lost on the Democrats is that the best guaranteed jobs program is not housed in a government building, it’s a strong economy like the one we’re living in now, one not bogged down by job-killing regulations and punitive tax rates.
I’m proud to say that my home state of #Iowa is one of the nation’s leaders in renewable energy, with wind providing nearly 40% of our electricity, more than any other state.
Don’t get me wrong. Increasing our reliance on renewables is a laudable goal and one that I support, but we have to be realistic about our current energy capabilities and needs.
With a $93 trillion price tag—roughly $10 trillion more than the entire recorded spending of the US government since our nation’s founding—this month’s squeal award goes to the #GreenNewDeal.
Every month I give out a Squeal Award, which draws attention to outrageous examples of wasteful and reckless spending of taxpayer money. #MakeEmSqueal
The truth is, this unrealistic proposal is a raw deal for America, especially our rural communities.
By its name you’d think that the American tax payer and the American worker are going to derive some benefit from it, but this couldn’t be further from the truth.
Joining a group of my @SenateGOP colleagues on the #Senate floor shortly to speak about the so-called, #GreenNewDeal. WATCH �:
In a letter to @SecWilkie in December I stated, “With approximately 20 veteran suicides every day in the United States… we can and must do better for our veterans.” I’m glad @POTUS and the Admin are taking additional steps to address this important issue.
#Iowa is home to more than 200 women-owned small biz more than 50 small biz owned by service-disabled vets. They should have the same contracting opportunities as businesses certified under other programs. My bill w/@SenDuckworth makes this possible.
The #GreenNewDeal would cost $65,000 per household per year. In #Iowa, that’s more than most households bring in. We need ideas that support the industries that help America thrive. This proposal is unrealistic a slam to our rural communities.

It was great to be with you all!
Only recently, @CommerceGov acted to level the playing field for U.S. biodiesel producers against Argentinian companies that were gaming our trade policies. I joined my colleagues in a letter to @SecretaryRoss to find out why the Admin is considering changing course. The letter️
The VA MISSION Act is critical to ensuring our veterans have access to the quality timely care they deserve. The VA has taken the next step towards implementation is seeking public comments. It’s crucial that this legislation is implemented in a way that prioritizes our vets.

#ICYMI @RadioIowa: ‘Billion Dollar Boondoggle’ bill from Sen. Ernst targets large-scale
It’s vital the U.S. continue to negotiate from a position of strength and not to make concessions when the NK regime isn’t being reasonable.
I’m encouraged @POTUS has engaged in diplomacy with our adversaries in North Korea to end their nuclear program. I’m particularly pleased he held firm in demanding concrete steps for the regime to denuclearize.
Under @IAGovernor’s leadership, #Iowa is making a name for itself in #STEM education and apprenticeship programs. It was great to talk about these issues w/members of @IowaSpaceGrant at my #CapitolGrounds constituent coffee yesterday.
You won't get this from the #GreenNewDeal: Republican efforts to cut red tape allow Americans to keep more of their hard-earned money have paid off. In 2018, the US economy grew at the highest rate in 13 years!
Speaking w/now-confirmed @EPA Administrator Wheeler yesterday, he made it clear to me that the Agency is on target to have E15 year-round in place by the summer driving season, something @POTUS has promised. I’ll continue to hold him to this on behalf of all hardworking #Iowans.
I’m encouraged by the progress we’ve made in the negotiations so far, and would like to see them completed soon.
In #Iowa, 1 in 5 jobs is tied directly to international trade. To ensure our farmers and manufacturers have the opportunity to compete in the global market, we must address China’s unfair trade practices and get a good deal for Americans.
#ICYMI I joined @SquawkCNBC to discuss my latest efforts to #MakeEmSqueal
Former presidents rake in millions of dollars from book deals, speaking engagements, more. There's no need for taxpayers to subsidize their unlimited perks. My bill w/@SenatorHassan will reform this system, while saving hard-working #Iowans millions.
It’s time for the #Senate to put a halt to these delay tactics and get back to fulfilling our commitments to the American people.
We can’t allow the #Senate to be bogged down by unprecedented obstruction tactics. The American people expect, and deserve, a fully-functioning government with the right personnel in place.
The recent levels of obstruction for nominees have not only kept the Executive Branch and our federal courts from staffing critical positions, but have also prevented the Senate from moving forward on other critical legislative priorities and initiatives.
As any #Iowa small business owner can tell you, if you don’t have employees, you can’t function.
This issue plagued the 115th Congress, and it is one that I hope we can move past to put our country before politics in this new session.
On my way to the #Senate floor to speak on the unprecedented levels of obstruction against the Admin’s nominees. TUNE IN:
Fortunately, partnering with state and local officials, we’ve found a solution to allow this land to be used for purposes that make sense for today’s Council Bluffs community.
The Western Historic Trails Center (WHTC) was created with the best intentions in mind. However, years later it became clear to the state and the city of Council Bluffs that the WHTC was no longer the best use for the land.
Big news for the Council Bluffs community today: as part of the #LandsPackage2019, legislation @ChuckGrassley I worked on to allow for land in the city to be repurposed, is headed to the President’s desk.
#ICYMI: @FDRLST: Sen. Joni Ernst Introduces Bill To Expose ‘Billion-Dollar Boondoggles’ Like California High-Speed Rail
The CA bullet train is more than a decade behind schedule $44B over budget. Hard-working #Iowans shouldn’t be paying the fare for this out-of-control spending. It’s time we derail this gravy train! That’s why this month’s Squeal Award goes to @CaHSRA.
#Iowans deserve to know how their hard-earned money is being spent. Today, I introduced the Billion Dollar Boondoggle Act, requiring disclosure of the cost timeline of tax-payer funded projects that are billions of dollars over budget behind schedule.
We face a moral crisis when the #Senate refuses to acknowledge the repugnancy savagery of infanticide. We must do better. I will continue to work to ensure our laws respect the human dignity of all persons. My statement:
Today, we had an opportunity to categorically reject infanticide by ensuring that the laws we have preventing this abhorrent practice are meaningfully enforced. I'm disappointed my #Senate colleagues chose partisanship over protecting newborns. Watch my full floor speech here:
This assault on human dignity cannot stand. On Monday, the #Senate will vote to outlaw killing a child after it’s been born. I hope to see all of my colleagues support this common sense effort.
Much of the fight against ISIS has been borne by our partners in Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. @POTUS is right to maintain a U.S. presence in the region, ensuring the enduring defeat of ISIS while working with allies to maintain peace and security.
.@IowaFFA plays an influential role in shaping the next generation of Iowa’s leaders. To recognize the work of the @NationalFFA across the country, the Senate passed a resolution designating this week as #NationalFFAWeek. Thanks for all that you do!
Congressional oversight of the @CFPB is overdue. That’s why I’m cosponsoring @SenDavidPerdue’s CFPB Accountability Act, which would subject the Bureau to the appropriations process like any other federal agency, ensuring transparency for and accountability to American consumers.
A happy 78th birthday to the @USCGReserve! Thanks to the dedicated men and women of the Coast Guard Reserve for their service to our country.
We ask our military their families to sacrifice so much. The least we can do is provide them with homes free of health safety hazards. Last week, I had the chance to ask military spouses about the housing issues they face steps we can take to address these challenges.

There's a lot to love about #Iowa! Happy #ValentinesDay!
At the end of the day, this legislation is a key starting point that will allow the president to move forward on desperately needed border security efforts.
While it sets up the critical framework for a border wall, I’m concerned there are provisions tucked into this compromise bill that will actually establish roadblocks for wall construction in areas where it is needed.
It also contains a provision that could hamstring federal law enforcement efforts and open the door for illegal criminals to evade deportation using vulnerable children.
...and the flow of drugs into #Iowa and the rest of the country. However, I’m frustrated this bill fails to extend the Violence Against Women Act, legislation I have long called on to be modernized and reauthorized.
We successfully fought back against radical unreasonable positions from our Democratic colleagues—like abolishing ICE borders all together—in order to reach a deal that provides critical funds for border security gives the president the tools to curb illegal immigration...
Negotiating in good faith and working towards a compromise means both sides get things they want and things they don’t. There’s a lot of good in this compromise legislation, but there are also parts that fall short.
This marks the fourth time William Barr has been confirmed by the United States Senate. For the second time in his distinguished career, he will lead @TheJusticeDept with honor and integrity. Congratulations Attorney General Barr!
.@EPA's proposed #WOTUS replacement rule is out open for comments! I’ve worked hard w/ the Admin to ensure this rewrite establishes clear reasonable definitions of what qualifies as 'WOTUS' provides needed regulatory certainty for #Iowa farmers, manufacturers, small biz.
This is just another reminder of why we need to codify my bill, Sarah’s Law, which requires fed law enforcement to detain illegal immigrants who've killed or seriously injured another person.
Good to see my Democratic colleagues walked back their border security proposal to put a cap on ICE detainees which would've allowed dangerous, criminal illegal aliens to go free.
Governor Reynolds has brought cutting edge workforce development strategies to #Iowa and will be a valuable addition to @realDonaldTrump’s American Workforce Policy Advisory Board. Her insight will help the nation mirror Iowa's success. Congrats!
.@SOIowa provides year-round sports training and athletic competition for over 14K athletes in #Iowa. Yesterday, I had the pleasure of meeting with self-advocate athlete Adam Rininger from Muscatine, and his mother.
As a mother, I understand how important it is for our policies to reflect the evolving needs of our workforce. Today, my colleagues and I met with @IvankaTrump to create a path forward for a paid family leave program that is voluntary, budget-neutral, and child-focused.
I've cosponsored an amendment requiring the federal government to balance its budget every year. It’s past time we get serious about confronting this impending crisis.
Out-of-control spending from Washington is piling on unthinkable harm to our children’s grandchildren’s futures. The news that the federal debt hit $22 trillion is appalling unacceptable.
The LWCF protects some of Iowa’s most unique places, enhances conservation projects, and develops outdoor recreational facilities, all of which boost our state’s economy.
Over the past 50 years, #Iowa lands, waters recreational facilities have benefited from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. As a longtime supporter of legislation to permanently reauthorize this program, I’m proud the Senate passed the #LandsPackage2019 to do just that.

S/o to @RepArrington, @RepCindyAxne, @RepFinkenauer others for introducing similar leg to my No Budget, No Recess Act, which keeps Congress in DC until budget approps process is complete. If this doesn't happen, we should stay in town work together until we get the job done
As we celebrate #NationalIowaDay, I'm reminded of what an honor it is to represent the best people and the greatest state in the nation. #Iowans, what are you doing to celebrate? ����‍�
William Barr is extremely qualified to be atty general. We’ve passed bipartisan opioid leg reformed our criminal justice system, but we need an AG in place to best implement these policies. Yesterday, I voted him out of @senjudiciary, now it's time for #Senate to confirm him.
We are past that date, so today I sent a letter requesting the report immediately. Read my full letter here:
Securing funding for the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project was a top priority. My provision in the 2018 water infrastructure bill requires the Army Corps of Engineers to submit a progress report within 90 days of its signing.
.@NWBC provides counsel to Congress the admin on economic challenges affecting women biz owners. I'm happy to report my nominee, Barb Kniff-McCulla of Pella, IA, is officially a member! She’ll bring a unique perspective on issues facing women biz owners in rural communities.
When bad actors abuse our trade policies, the President should have the tools available to hold them accountable. However, the @DeptofDefense, not @CommerceGov, should evaluate the nat'l security basis for tariffs. My legislation reforms that process:
I’m proud of our achievements, and I’m glad for the leadership of @POTUS and folks willing to work together to get our economy moving. There is more work yet to be done, and I look forward to seeing our economy continue to achieve new heights.
Simply put, when Washington gives power back to Main Street, American families win.
Furthermore, cutting red tape and scaling back burdensome regulations has led to a surge in small business optimism.
For example, a business in Dyersville, Iowa invested 75% of their tax savings last year into their employees, giving $800 bonuses to their 162 full time workers. One of their employees said she planned to put her bonus into her retirement fund, an investment in her future.
The #TaxCutsandJobsAct has allowed Iowa’s job creators to invest in their workers and grow their businesses.
Nowhere is the power of this job creation more evident than #Iowa, where the 2.4 percent unemployment rate is the lowest in the nation. There are 64,000 plus jobs open in Iowa right now! Over 1.6 million Iowans are employed – the most in our state’s history.
The tight labor market has drawn workers off of the sidelines. Folks that have been unemployed or underemployed are finding work.
Just as important, this economic growth has put upward pressure on wages, with the average hourly pay increasing by 3.2 percent from last year. Lower-wage workers saw some of the biggest increases.
Last Friday’s January jobs report is a continued good news story, with 304,000 new jobs added last month.  It is also an example of how Republican pro-growth policies are getting people back to work.
I rise today to speak on the strength of the U.S. economy. As President Trump said in last night’s #SOTU, “our economy is thriving like never before.”
I'm headed to the #Senate floor to speak on the success of our pro-growth policies and the strength of the economy. Tune in!

In the world's greatest deliberative body, the United States Senate, it is unfathomable that a bill that simply prohibits infanticide was blocked on the floor. Rationality, decency and basic human compassion have fallen by the wayside. Watch my full floor speech here:

I am encouraged by my conversation with @SecWilkie this week on helping our vets who are at risk. I’m grateful he is addressing those concerns and he’s made suicide prevention his top priority. (2/2)
As a combat veteran, one of my top concerns is ensuring our vets have the support and services they deserve—especially access to critical suicide prevention care. That’s why I’ve been in close contact w/ the VA on this very issue. (1/2)
January's jobs report is yet another example of Republican pro-growth policies at work. Exceeding expectations, 304,000 new jobs were added to the economy wages continue to rise. Our policies are creating more opportunity for #Iowans all Americans:
Crimes committed by those here illegally, like the tragic death of Sarah Root, are among the most heartbreaking, senseless and preventable. Although nothing can bring Sarah back, we can ensure that no person falls victim to this injustice again by codifying my bill, Sarah’s Law.
One of my favorite traditions I’ve held since my first year in the Senate is doing a ruck march in Washington, D.C. with fellow veterans and members of my staff. Despite the bitter cold, we pushed full-speed ahead last night!
The #TaxCutsAndJobsAct means Iowans are keeping more of their hard-earned money small businesses are growing. Since historic #TaxReform, Iowa has added 15,500 jobs unemployment has fallen to 2.4%, the lowest in the nation.
These bills are horrific and not who we are as Americans. There is no excuse to kill a baby – but the idea that Democrats are actually calling for the legalization of infanticide is a call to action. This isn’t just extreme, it’s barbaric and inhumane.

Sarah’s Law brings us closer to restoring justice in our broken immigration system by allowing law enforcement to detain hold criminals accountable. We have an obligation to the Root family to ensure that no citizen falls victim to this injustice again.

Good news: The deadline for #Iowa farmers to apply for trade-relief aid has been extended by @USDA. Following the partial shutdown, the Jan. 15 deadline will be extended by the number of biz days the FSA is closed. Farmers already receiving payments will continue to do so.
Both men exemplified bravery and dedication to their community. 
Please join me in praying for the family and friends of Lt. Eric Hosette, a 12-year veteran of the Clinton Fire Dept, who gave his life in the line of duty Saturday. And, please pray for a full recovery for Clinton firefighter Adam Cain, who was injured in the same accident.

Wishing everyone a very Merry Christmas a Happy Holiday Season! As we gather w/ friends family, let’s all remember the men women who are serving our nation. To our servicemembers their families: thank you for your sacrifices to keep our country safe.
I've seen firsthand Air Force Sec Heather Wilson's leadership for our men and women in uniform - she would make a great Secretary of Defense and make our country proud.
The best choice for SecDef would also be the nation's first woman to hold that distinction - Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson. AF Academy grad, veteran, Rhodes Scholar, member of Congress, and a fighter for our men and women in uniform. @SecAFOfficial @usairforce
W/approx 20 veteran suicides daily in the US the lack of outreach by the ⁦⁦@DeptVetAffairs⁩ is simply unacceptable. I'm profoundly disappointed to learn the VA has fallen short in fulfilling this responsibility. We can must do better for our vets.
