Great threat for more spring flooding than usual across the Red River Basin. Make sure you’re prepared: And remember: these policies usually take 30 days to go into effect.
So thankful to have spent last recess meeting our state’s airmen and National Guard. These are the friends and neighbors we see every day, yet they offer to risk their lives at a moment’s notice. #NDMilitaryTour
Today we pause to celebrate the women who changed the course of history and the women who move our nation forward. #InternationalWomensDay
Who we choose to build the wall defines whether it actually gets built. The Army Corp of Engineers has been an abstract failure and should not be trusted to secure the southern border. We need someone to #BuildTheWall on time and under budget.
I never cease to be impressed and honored by those who sacrifice their lives for our freedom. Thank you to all who serve and have served. #NDMilitaryTour
I’m thankful to everyone who met with me during the #NDMilitaryTour. They gave me the opportunity to learn how to support, bolster, and grow our already-impressive military community.As the first North Dakotan to sit on @SASCMajority, I want to learn how to best serve them.
The #GreenNewDeal is not serious policy; it’s a fantasy. I’m personally so disappointed to see so many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle cosponsor this- especially those seeking higher office- and ignore these realities.
A tax-and-spend agenda- to pay for an energy plan that wouldn’t even work- flies in the face of one of our nation’s greatest success stories.The rocket-ship economy is being driven by the energy renaissance happening all across the country. #GreenNewDeal
The Democrat Politician Protection Act does nothing to improve our elections system. It’s simply a power grab that puts the interests of DC bureaucrats ahead of the American people.
I believe divided government is the right time for both parties to come together to pass laws that reflect shared goals and values. So you can imagine my disappointment when I read the #GreenNewDeal. It is not serious policy, it is not good policy.
Speaking on the floor today about Democrats’ #GreenNewDeal. I support an all-the-above energy strategy that capitalizes on the best our nation has to offer. That is not what defines the Green New Deal. It’s unrealistic, unworkable, and unaffordable.
I urged Amb. Doud— and the entire administration— to continue putting American agricultural interests first as these trade talks progress.
Appreciate Amb. Doud taking the time to give a briefing on trade efforts with China, USMCA, UK, and several other countries. North Dakota’s farmers and ranchers feed and fuel the world. They deserve trade deals that ensure their product is treated fairly on the world stage.
Great to see North Dakota’s Tommy Fisher on @foxandfriends today. The Army Corps of Engineers has failed at building physical barriers along the southern border. The American people deserve a wall built on time and under budget. #BuildTheWall
Veteran suicide is a national tragedy.Those willing to risk their lives to protect our freedoms deserve all the proper care and help our nation can give.I applaud @POTUS for taking action to empower veterans.
Introduced the Chief of the Environmental Health Section of North Dakota’s Department of Health Dave Glatt to @EPWGOP.Couldn’t think of a better guest to discuss the importance of cooperative federalism than this North Dakotan.
I knew Darrol Schroeder nearly my whole life. He was a good man and a devoted public servant who truly cared about his country, his state, and his fellow pilots. Kris and I are thankful for his decades of service. He will truly be missed.
We’ve got a lot of work to do to fix our bureaucracy. The Army Corps of Engineers has failed to build physical barriers along the southern border, even though they already have funds to do so. We need to #BuildTheWall and we need to do it now.
I will vote NO on the resolution of disapproval. I've read the national declaration and I’ve read the statutes, and I believe @POTUS is within his authority. We need to #BuildTheWall.
RT @elwasson: . @SenKevinCramer tells us he had the Chick-fil-A at the White House party , not the Big Mac
.@POTUS, thank you for acknowledging this incredible accomplishment.The folks in Bison nation, are not tired of winning and never will be tired of winning.This team epitomizes the incredible culture of our great state, and we couldn’t be better represented. #GoBison #NDSUinDC
The @NDSUfootball Team is on the way to the @WhiteHouse! #GoBison
Kris, Abel I are looking forward to greeting the team at @WhiteHouse with @POTUS soon! #NDSUinDC
We are at Barracks Row and ready to worship this morning! #GodIsGood.
Congrats to @Kindred_Vikings Girls Basketball Team on winning another @NDHSAA Championship! I watched listened to @DomIzzoWDAY on my tablet in DC. Proud of my High School! #NDpreps
WTO rulings often move at a glacial pace. American industries suffering now should not be asked to wait for potential action from international court that could be years down the road.
This ruling is a good reminder why—after decades of inaction— @POTUS stood up for our country on the world stage to get us better deals, and why he should continue to do so.
Now, the farmers leading North Dakota’s “wheat resurgence” will no longer have to compete with an intentionally overly-subsidized foreign product.
The WTO said this week what we’ve known for years. China has consistently acted in bad faith and broken trade rules, and American agriculture industries suffer because of it.
Speaking at #CPAC2019 on public lands panel. Discussed the disastrous #GreenNewDeal, the carbon tax, #DAPL, and importing oil from foreign nations.
Given the public and private interest and resources already available, there is no reason the wall can’t be completed quickly and correctly. #BuildTheWall
I spoke with @SecNielsen about what I can do to ensure the wall is built on time and under budget, which is what @POTUS, Congress, and the American people rightfully expect and deserve.
Before @POTUS’s national emergency declaration, the Army Corp of Engineers had been contracted to build physical barriers along the southern border. Their work so far can generously be characterized as overpriced and inefficient.
.@POTUS: “We must choose between greatness or gridlock results or resistancevision or vengeanceincredible progress or pointless destruction.”Let’s choose greatness.
I urge my colleagues to support the proposed rules changes that would prevent good nominees from being anonymously delayed and derailed.
The adequate pace of @EPAAWheeler’s confirmation process stands in stark contrast to many well-qualified presidential appointees who faced unnecessary and unprecedented delays, both in this Congress and the last one.
It’s good to see Mr. Wheeler confirmed, and I hope to bring him to North Dakota soon.
.@EPAAWheeler handled WOTUS and the Clean Power Plan well. Cementing his role as Administrator allows him to continue working on important issues like the E15 ethanol rule, which I’m confident he’ll finalize this summer as he’s stated.
Senate Democrats’ arguments against Mr. Wheeler just didn’t add up.
I voted yes on @EPAAWheeler’s nomination because the policies he’s promoted and implemented are good for my state and the country.
As a Farm Bill conferee representing @HouseCommerce, I was directly responsible for ensuring this top North Dakota priority receive adequate funding.
Encouraged to see @USDA_APHIS acting quickly to implement the federal vaccine bank funded by the 2018 Farm Bill.
RT @RJC: Great job
Well done today, @RepArmstrongND.
This bipartisan legislation ensures all student veterans using GI benefits- like the 2,000 student veterans in ND colleges and universities- can take advantage of paid internships or work opportunities while in school.
As they continue through the process, I’m pushing for reforms to the way we handle nominations. The proposed changes would help ensure qualified nominees like Drew and Peter can’t be anonymously and unnecessarily held. The failures of last Congress should not be repeated.
Drew and Peter are excellent nominees whose outstanding credentials will once again win the support of my colleagues.
�The nominations of Drew Wrigley to be District Attorney for North Dakota and Peter Welte to be District Judge for North Dakota will be before the Senate @senjudiciary tomorrow.
Industry experience is an asset, not an issue. Democrats are holding well-qualified nominees like @EPAAWheeler to an unnecessary, unrealistic standard. 
Today’s vote is another addition to a long list of examples which demonstrate why the system is badly in need of reform.
Since the start of the 116th Congress, @BankingGOP has spent valuable time considering these nominations, the majority of whom passed through committee last Congress but never received a vote on the Senate floor.
.@usairforce General John E. Hyten: “Senator, thanks for going to Minot, Cavalier, and Grand Forks. They’re pretty special places; and when you see the people, you should feel very, very good about this country. They’re amazing people.” #NDMilitaryTour
About to do my radio town hall with @JayThomasAM970. Tune in️
Democrats previously supported physical barriers at the border.But now they're going to vote against the national emergency declaration only to oppose @POTUS. The crisis at the southern border is real. They should join us in working to address it.
Democrats used to support cabinet nominees with industry experience. Their position only changed when @POTUS changed.@EPAAWheeler is a competent, qualified nominee.
This isn’t about ramming through nominees, this is about reforming the system Democrats exploit by slow-walking hundreds of qualified nominees. The way we currently handle nominations doesn’t work.
Most Senate Democrats just voted against the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Many in the the “pro-science” party now favor letting newborn babies be denied medical care while funding radical proposals that would bankrupt the nation.
Let’s be clear— people are receiving smaller refunds because the government is taking less of their money in the first place. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is paying dividends for North Dakota.
New video highlighting inconsistency in Senate Democrats’ arguments against @EPAAWheeler's nomination. Should we bar farmers from running USDA? Doctors from running HHS? Attorneys from being AG?This is a very funny path to go down.
On Monday the Senate will vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This bill is as commonsense as they come. Democrats should reject their extreme base and vote to support life.
Yet another win for @POTUS in the ongoing trade dispute with China. As Secretary Perdue said, this shows President Trump’s strategy is working. Hopefully this is one of many positive announcements for our farmers and ranchers.
Stopped by the Hyperbaric Clinic to learn more about this technology and their efforts to treat veterans with traumatic brain injuries. #NDMilitaryTour
Continued the #NDMilitaryTour at the 119th Wing of the North Dakota Air National Guard.Learned more about the MQ-9 and heard from some #HappyHooligans about their mission to protect and support our nation.
Concluding the #NDMilitaryTour today meeting with the Happy Hooligans in Fargo. Freedom-loving people around the world are grateful to these service members for making the defense of liberty a habit.
Brief by Colonel Spencer at @319ABW.National defense is a top priority, and this base has made continuous growth in their efforts to protect our nation. #NDMilitaryTour
About to do my weekly radio town hall with @scotthennen.Tune in:
Under current law, how long a person waits for a green card is based on where they were born. That’s not fair, and that’s not right. Let’s pass the bipartisan Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act and improve our immigration system.
Spoke with the @gfherald about the #NDMilitaryTour, Grand Sky and Cavalier, and North Dakota’s role in advancing the Space Force.
Good to see my friend Bruce Gjovig yesterday and to receive an update on UAS activities at Grand Sky. I’m optimistic about the great potential here. #NDMilitaryTour
Stopped by the Cavalier Chamber of Commerce meeting. These folks have an excellent opportunity to advocate for this town.
Today’s first stop on the #NDMilitaryTour: Cavalier Air Station. They do vital work tracking satellites, space objects, and potential missile launches aimed at North America.
.@POTUS made an excellent decision in putting the Space Force under the Air Force’s purview. With the great Air Force bases in Minot and Grand Forks, I look forward to seeing what North Dakotans can offer Space Force. Full interview with @KXNewsMinot:
Visiting Grand Forks and Cavalier as part of my #NDMilitaryTour. Cavalier plays a critical role in our nation’s space efforts, and I’m optimistic about the great potential Grand Sky possesses.
About to go on @JTKNOXRADIO for my weekly radio town hall. Tune in:
.@POTUS stands ready to work with Congress to help all Americans. Let’s come together to pass the positive, bipartisan agenda that he’s put forward.
Spoke to the Minot Area Development Corp tonight about growing the economy and addressing North Dakota’s workforce challenges.
Productive discussion this afternoon with Task Force 21, strong advocates and supporters of @TeamMinot. #NDMilitaryTour
Touring @TeamMinot with @RepArmstrongND. We met with Colonel Cochran to discuss combat readiness and their fleet of B-52 bombers. #NDMilitaryTour
Continuing my #NDMilitaryTour today visiting @TeamMinot’s 5th Bomb Wing and 91st Missile Wing. As they say, “Only the Best Come North.” My thoughts in today’s @MinotDailyNews:
Spoke with @robport about @POTUS’s emergency declaration and the rising support for socialism. It’s important this dangerous ideology be rejected in our state and in our country.
The Green New Deal is a radical plan that would hurt my state and harm our nation. Just look at what these kinds of policies have already done. If Democrats want real energy reform, they should try negotiating, not pointless posturing.
Began my #NDMilitaryTour in Bismarck today. As a member of @SASCMajority and @VAChair, I want to learn how to best support our soldiers. My thoughts in today’s @bistrib:
Tested the Lakota helicopter simulator at the Army Aviation Battalion in Bismarck. #NDMilitaryTour
Great meeting with Major General Dohrmann to kick off the #NDMilitaryTour. Talked about defense funding, tuition assistance, and North Dakota’s upcoming expansion projects.
Spoke with the Landowners Association Meeting this morning about water rights and landowners’ rights, important issues for me as Chairman of the @EPWGOP Fisheries, Water, and Wildlife subcommittee.
Soon the Senate will vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill @POTUS would sign. Congress should fulfill its oath to protect life and pass this legislation.
“When I set my roots in North Dakota, I recognized that while India was where I was born, this was now my home. My sincere hope is to be able to help other members of the community find that same sense of belonging.” Well said. Let’s get this passed.
Today we pay tribute to George Washington for his service and to all who have taken the oath as President of this great country. May we learn from their lives and legacies. #PresidentsDay
Kris I loved seeing our friend @mattveemusic Julie @prairieknights present “I am He Said”. Great talent, great band, great show, great guy.
.@POTUS said it right: we must commit to never becoming a socialist country. It’s time to reject the politics of extremism and resistance.
Next week I’ll be touring military bases and stations all throughout North Dakota. As a member of @SASCMajority, I look forward to hearing how we can to bolster and enhance our military community.
Wonderful piece by my #SOTU guest and good friend, @debjyotidwivedy. It’s time for Congress to pass the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act.
As he’s said from day one, @POTUS will address the crisis at the southern border, whether or not Congress does. Today he fulfilled that promise and acted- not without precedent- to put national security first.
This #SOTU was a pro-North Dakota State of The Union. @POTUS set the agenda, now let’s get it done.
Praying for the victims, and their loved ones, of this heinous terror attack that’s already taken 45 lives. I will continue to monitor the situation and hope to be briefed when more information is available.
I’ve encouraged the President’s team to work with Tommy’s company, and I hope they do.
As it relates to building physical barriers along the southern border, I met with Tommy Fisher of Fisher Industries today, who believes his North Dakota company could build the wall on time and under budget. 
This legislation pays for 55 miles of new border barriers and includes $22.5 billion for overall border security.
Through divided government we achieved a deal that provides a down payment for the wall, doesn’t limit executive action on border security, meets the needs of our immigration law enforcement, and fully funds the government through the fiscal year.
While Democratic leadership has refused to tackle this issue, I stand with @POTUS in favor of funding border security as we head into budget talks for the upcoming fiscal year.
From day one, @POTUS made it clear he’s ready to address the crisis at the southern border, whether or not Congress works with him.
Met with my good friend and Air Force General Rodney Lewis. We talked the ND Air Force, the space force, and how @UofNorthDakota gives @319ABW an advantage for future missions. He’s a former Grand Forks wing commander himself.
Barr’s nomination is another example of one side unnecessarily holding up a qualified nominee- who is inevitably confirmed anyway- only because of political posturing. The current system does not work. Both sides need to come together to reform the way we handle nominations.
William Barr’s confirmation today presents an opportunity to highlight the need to reform the nominations process. In this case, Democrats- for no reason- delayed his committee vote by one week.
Mr. Barr assured me he would take the DOJ in a more federalist direction by reforming the department’s culture, and I look forward to working with him to ensure that happens.
When I met Mr. Barr, I expressed concerns about the consolidation of litigation authority at the DOJ and how this has empowered bureaucrats to fight states’ rights and constitutional principles.
I voted for William Barr because he’s an accomplished attorney with decades of public service who is ready to take on the bureaucracy within the Department of Justice.
Good to visit with North Dakota’s Tommy, Ryan, and Grant Fisher today. @SenMcSallyAZ joined us to talk border security. Through 3 generations Fisher Indsutries has become a staple of North Dakota. I can’t think of anyone better to #BuildTheWall.
I appreciate @EPAAWheeler transparency here. I remain committed to ensuring rural water groups have a voice on this issue, and to letting regional areas handle it the way they see fit, rather than a one-size-fits-all policy dictated to them by Washington.
Introduced North Dakota’s Game and Fish Director and my friend Terry Steinwald at today's @EPWGOP hearing, where he gave our state’s perspective on combatting invasive species.
.@SenAmyKlobuchar and I introduced the Office of Rural Broadband Act with @SenJohnHoeven and @RonWyden. As @POTUS continues to make progress on expanding rural broadband, Congress needs to remove unnecessary barriers so more rural Americans can receive internet access.
As promised, @POTUS re-nominated Drew Wrigley. This is good news for North Dakota all who stand for justice and the rule of law. Drew is an outstanding nominee with a wealth of experience. I urge my colleagues to act quickly to make up for the failures of the 115th Congress.
Everyone should say yes. @RoyBlunt is right: the way the Senate handles nominations doesn’t work. The World’s Greatest Deliberative Body needs to get better at deliberating.
The Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act is about exactly that: fairness. The long wait for these green cards is a disservice to legal immigrants and to the potential of the American economy. Let’s get this passed.
�@senjudiciary just announced North Dakota's Peter Welte will have his hearing before the committee tomorrow. He's an excellent nominee, and I fully expect him to win the support of my colleagues this Wednesday. My statement️
The military is foundational for North Dakota culture. These subcommittees help ensure our military community will continue to be a hub for new innovation and security for the entire country.
The Emerging Threats and Capabilities Sub-Committee is responsible for programs related to emerging technologies, which includes space research projects that have a nexus to the @UofNorthDakota.
The Airland Sub-Committee oversees the Army and Air Force, giving me direct nexus to bases in Grand Forks and Minot. It also oversees the National Guard, which has nearly 4,000 soldiers and airmen dispersed across the state, especially Bismarck and Fargo.
My seat on the Strategic Forces Sub-Committee has wide jurisdiction over our Nuclear forces and missile defenses. Serving on this committee will be of benefit to the ICBM and B-52 Bomber missions at @TeamMinot.
I asked for @SASCMajority subcommittees where I could have the greatest impact for North Dakota. They give us a voice on important state issues like the Grand Forks and Minot Air Force Bases, Cavalier, UND, and the National Guard.
This demand is as insufficient as it is insincere. No administration- Democrat or Republican- would accept a ridiculous demand to hamstring our law enforcement like this.
These pro-growth policies have delivered for our state, and the country, and will continue for years to come.
The tax cuts are working in North Dakota.
I’m co-sponsoring the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Act with @SenMikeLee. The long wait for green cards these immigrants face is a disservice to them, their families, and the potential of the American economy. Let’s get this passed.
.@POTUS and @NDSUfootball have a lot in common: they never get tired of winning. I’m thankful the President will host these exceptional athletes.
There’s nothing “controversial” about this: anti-Semitism is wrong. Her comments must be universally condemned.
I believe @SenJohnHoeven and the border security conference committee can strike a deal. I see progress being made, and I urge the committee to find a way to keep the government open.
My office took the Neal family from Fargo to the top of the Capitol Dome this week. Quite the view, and quite the walk down.
I wore this button to honor National Tribal Colleges Week as I presided over the Senate. These colleges offer students an atmosphere where they can increase their knowledge and skillsets grounded in cultural traditions.
This month, we get to celebrate our diversity and the generations of African Americans who have contributed greatly to our nation’s story. #BlackHistoryMonth
Ken Cara Hall were 2 of the North Dakotans attending the 2019 National Prayer Breakfast. #GodisGood.
All these meetings give me a chance to advance a pro-North Dakota agenda and to influence policies as they are being made. I look forward to continuing to meet with important leaders, like @DOIDepSec.
Nicole Nason’s nomination to run @USDOTFHWA is now before the @EPWGOP. I met with her to discuss the importance to North Dakota of reauthorizing the highway bill and repairing our crumbling infrastructure.
This afternoon I met with a familiar face, Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney. With the entire Fargo-Moorhead Flood Diversion Authority in town, I was able to hear their update on the latest local projects.
I also spoke with @SecAFOfficial about the importance of the nuclear triad in North Dakota and about their budget. Sitting on both @BudgetGOP and @SASCmajority allow me to help craft a @usairforce budget that reflects their mission and the right priorities.
This morning I spoke with @SecWilkie about rural health care, strengthening the relationship between @DeptVetAffairs and Native American veterans, and giving them health care control. As a member of @VAChair, I plan to bring him to our state to meet North Dakota veterans.
Yesterday I met with @TheJusticeDept nominee William Barr. We discussed states’ rights and my concern about the consolidation of litigation authority that's empowered bureaucrats to fight against @POTUS. He's a qualified nominee and I look forward to supporting him.
As the agenda for the #116thCongress is being set, I’ve held several meetings with top administration officials and North Dakota leaders this week to discuss shared priorities.
Now is the time to reject over-the-top political partisanship and rhetoric and to deliver results for the American people. That’s what I’m committed to doing. #SOTU
Some will immediately denounce this agenda; sadly, some already did even before @POTUS gave his speech. That is wrong. #SOTU
On the heels of a rocket-ship economy, @POTUS offers a plan to revitalize our crumbling infrastructure, negotiate better trade deals, protect national security, and fix our broken immigration system. Divided government is the right time to enact these bipartisan solutions. #SOTU
Tonight @POTUS delivered an uplifting message that this entire country— and this entire Congress— can rally behind. #SOTU
RT @SenateGOP: TUNE IN: @POTUS @realdonaldtrump delivers the #SOTU address
He’s arrived! Still so thankful to be joined by @debjyotidwivedy. #SOTU
Added a very special #SOTU guest, @realMikeLindell. He’s a good friend and an even better man of God.He also makes one great pillow.
I hope to hear @POTUS strike a serious yet aspiring tone in his #SOTU tonight. He has a positive agenda that both sides could support, if they’re willing to do so.
Finally.
.@POTUS is committed to ensuring strong political support for the Kurds in Syria. While he’s calling for an orderly withdrawal of ground troops, he’s not going to abandon the Kurdish people.
@BloombergTV @cj_wentz @kevcirilli Told him he’d fit right in wearing his Eagles jersey if he ever visits North Dakota.
Enjoyed my interview with @BloombergTV Chief Washington Correspondent and fellow @cj_wentz fan @kevcirilli yesterday.
During his confirmation hearing, I questioned Mr. Wheeler on year-round E15 and RFS before inviting him to visit North Dakota.
The arguments against Mr. Wheeler do not hold up; his energy, environment, and EPA experiences are an asset, not a liability. I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Wheeler and to vote on his confirmation as quickly as possible.
The policies pursued by @POTUS and implemented by @EPAAWheeler have had a positive impact on North Dakota and the country. Mr. Wheeler’s excellent work on RFS, WOTUS, the Clean Power Plan, and year-round E15 show he is ready to take on this position in a permanent capacity.
It is my hope we can finally pass a version of the Fairness for High Skilled Immigrants Workers Act this Congress. #SOTU
ND is blessed to be home to many immigrant software developers, physicians, surgeons, engineers and other professionals. The long wait for these valued neighbors and servants to get green cards is a disservice to them, their families, and the potential of the American economy.
As Congress debates the many aspects of our broken immigration system, Debjyoti offers expertise and experiences that reflect North Dakota priorities and values. @immivoice has been a steady support in my effort to lift the arbitrary per-country caps on high-skilled immigrants.
My #SOTU guest is @debjyotidwivedy. He’s a an Enterprise Cloud Manager, @NDSU Master’s degree recipient, and Senior Vice President of @immivoice.
We need an all-the-above strategy to fix the crisis at the border, including physical barriers. That’s what @POTUS is committed to, and Democrats should join him. #SOTU
Walking to work always inspires. This #SOTU morning especially. #GodisGood.
.@POTUS is ready to address the crisis at the southern border. It’s on Congress to decide whether to continue obstructing his efforts or to be part of the solution. #SOTU
I joined @SenJoniErnst in re-introducing Sarah’s Law. No one should walk free after taking someone’s life. We have to work to protect our citizens.
@NCC worship was incredible today at Barracks Row. Message by @joelschmidgall @ninaschmidgall touched Kris and me. I can’t wait to read their new book. #prayingcirclesaroundyourmarriage #GodisGood.
Abel was not impressed with this DC snowman.
From day one, @POTUS has made it clear he will not allow the U.S. to be the victim of foreign nations acting in bad faith. I support this administration and our NATO allies as they engage in effective arms control negotiations that will hold all parties accountable.
Let’s be clear: Russia has been violating this treaty for years.Their covert attempts to continue developing a missile system the INF explicitly prohibited is unacceptable.
A smart step by @SecretarySonny that will help diversify our agricultural exports. This administration is doing an excellent job finding innovative ways to expand our markets, even in the face of trade disputes.
Great to see Bruce Gjovig in D.C. We spoke about the Cavalier Air Force Station, the growth of Grand Sky in Grand Forks, and my work on @SASCMajority this Congress.
Through this Conference Committee, @POTUS has given Democrats a chance to live up to their rhetoric: that they would negotiate a deal while the government’s re-opened. Let’s get this done.
Met with students from Minnewaukan High School in my office yesterday. These students had great questions about the legislative process and immigration reform.
A divided Congress presents an opportunity to strike a deal on an infrastructure package. With the highway bill expiring soon, now is the time to act.
.@usdafsa changed the dates for deadlines that were impacted by the shutdown. Get the facts here️
Good for @SecretarySonny. The way the Senate’s handled nominations doesn’t work, and it’s time we consider serious changes to the nominations process.
Great news: Grand Forks is ranked one of the best cities for veterans to live. As a new member of the Senate Veterans Affairs committee, I’ll work to give these veterans a voice on issues that matter most to them.
North Dakota farmers and families should not have to posthumously pay for being successful. The tax cuts were a good first step toward ending this unfair taxation, and I hope we finally abolish it.
The tax cuts are working in North Dakota. Since they were passed, we’ve added over 9,000 jobs.
I’m joining @SenJohnBarrasso, @SenatorEnzi, and @SenJohnHoeven to co-sponsor the ONSHORE Act. As a former energy and environmental state regulator, I’ve always opposed the federal government imposing its mediocrity on North Dakota.
Looking forward to chairing this @EPWGOP subcommittee. It gives North Dakota an outsized voice on issues like WOTUS, the Clean Water Act, and countless others.
Extreme weather conditions in North Dakota that only get worse as the week goes on. Stay safe!
I’m co-sponsoring the End Government Shutdowns Act. It enhances predictability, reduces pressure for imperfect, last-minute deals, saves taxpayer dollars, and helps economic growth. As a member of @BudgetGOP, it’s time we make real changes to this process.
Last night the Senate sent a positive message to our allies in the Middle East, but the work isn’t done. Let’s get this bill passed.
Another step in the right direction for our soybean producers thanks to @POTUS. I’ll continue to work with the administration to see more markets opened and more export growth.
Deeply disturbing. As I’ve said from day one, the rising tide of anti-Semitism among House Democrats shouldn’t be ignored or tolerated.
More than 4 in 5 American Indian women- and Alaska Native women- have experienced violence in their life. That’s unacceptable. I’m co-sponsoring #SavannasAct with @lisamurkowski because something must be done.
Our budget system needs reform. I’m co-sponsoring legislation with @senrobportman to prevent government shutdowns from creating chaos for the people who rely on federal services. We have to end the weaponization of this process.
With the government re-opened, we’re again voting on a bill to support Israel and Jordan while sanctioning Assad. Democrats first opposed it because of politics, but now is their chance to stand with our allies in the region.
We have 18 days to prevent another shutdown and fund border security. I’m confident @SenJohnHoeven and our colleagues on the conference committee can find a long-term solution that satisfies both sides.
We’ve reintroduced #SavannasAct, important legislation to help combat crimes on tribal lands. Let’s work together to make sure the #116thCongress gets this done.
May we never forget the countless, innocent lives lost, and may we always honor their memory. #WeRemember
With the government re-opened, @SpeakerPelosi and Senate Democrats must come to the table so we can find a long-term solution. Now is the time to act.
.@POTUS is right: Congress needs to step up and tackle immigration reform, but this shutdown has demonstrated larger problems in the way our government is run. Congress should consider including broad budgetary and personnel reforms in any future deals.
I supported today’s deal. While @SpeakerPelosi refused to even come to the table, @POTUS was the adult in the room who ended this impasse.
It’s a tragedy that what used to be the mainstream media rushes to judgement because they want to believe a story. These students did nothing wrong. They were not the guilty party.
Right now, we’re voting on the one bill that actually ends this shutdown. It secures the border, re-opens the government, gets federal workers paid and back to work, and includes reforms Democrats have wanted for years. Now is the time to get this done.
Now is the time to get something done. @SpeakerPelosi- and the Senate Democrats protecting her- are the reason the government is still shutdown, but she is running out of time and her caucus is running out of patience.
Spoke with @SandraSmithFox and @BillHemmer on @AmericaNewsroom about re-opening the government. Only one of today's bills could become law and end the shutdown, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it.
North Dakota is always happy to host you, Mr. President!
This has got to be one of the most important days of the year. I’d never pass up an opportunity for a slice. #NationalPieDay
If @SpeakerPelosi had spent as much time negotiating as she did being petty about the State of the Union, the shutdown would be over by now.
While @POTUS offers a plan to re-open the government and secure our borders, Democrats only offer obstruction. It’s now clear their only goal is to oppose this President.
Once again, @SecretarySonny is finding ways to provide relief to our farmers. I commend the administration for making them a priority.
