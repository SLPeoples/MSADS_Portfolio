The Senate should be debating the science of climate change and the solutions of the #GreenNewDeal. Instead, Republicans are on the Senate floor right now repeating Koch Brothers misinformation and not offering a single solution of their own.
FALSE: The #GreenNewDeal will “cost up to $65k per American household per year” over the next decade.TRUE: It is a non-binding resolution, not a legislative vehicle. It's a platform that has launched a movement around climate action. It has no funding proposals in it whatsoever
FALSE. This figure comes from a hit piece “report” bought and paid for by #BigOil. It is made up of artificially inflated numbers and wholly made up facts. TRUE: The group who produced the report, the American Action Forum, has spent $40 million+ attacking Democrats since 2010.
Eating hamburgers and making jokes about cows did nothing to change Americans’ minds that climate change is an existential threat. This week’s WSJ/NBC poll showed 63% of the American people believe the Republican position on climate change is out of the mainstream.

Climate change is literally destroying the planet. According to the Trump admin's National Climate Assessment, with no action, climate change will result in 10% GDP loss by 2090. A #GreenNewDeal addresses this climate reality, not right-wing
Republicans are resorting to spreading misinformation about what is in the #GreenNewDeal. They don’t want a real debate because they know they’re wrong. Let’s take a look at what actually IS in the resolution and the commonsense solutions Republicans are desperate to defeat:
North Korea’s blatant human rights abuses are egregious and must be addressed. Instead, Trump shamefully peddled Kim Jong Un’s version of North Korea’s brutal murder of Otto Warmbier, disrespecting his memory and the entire Warmbier family.
If confirmed, Andrew Wheeler will be an architect of the Republican plan to deny and defund climate change efforts. Given the irrefutable climate science before us, voting yes his nomination to be EPA Admin is a vote against our health and security. I will be voting NO today.
The consequences of climate change will be dire if we do not take action. A tenfold increase in ice-free summers in the Arctic. 99% loss of coral reefs. A doubling of species loss.We need bold goals that meet the scale of the threat we are facing. We need a #GreenNewDeal.

The lack of working-level talks in the lead up to the #HanoiSummit undermined the chances of reaching a successful deal. I urge both sides to immediately continue their engagement so that we can reach an agreement that halts and rolls back North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs.
These communities will also be the most affected and least able to respond to the impacts of climate change. The Green New Deal represents an opportunity to lift up all workers and all communities.
The #GreenNewDeal mobilization will be an opportunity to repair the historic oppression of frontline and vulnerable communities, which have borne the worst burdens of pollution from our fossil fuel economy.
Over the past two years, super-charged natural disasters have cost the U.S. $400 billion in damage. We are going to spend trillions by the end of the century.For those who say we can’t afford to act to address the climate crisis, I say that we can’t afford not to. #GreenNewDeal

Any time the science and solutions to climate change are debated, Republicans and the fossil fuel lobby spread disinformation, attack supporters, and get allied groups to undermine action. We cannot let them derail us. The #GreenNewDeal isn't just a resolution, it's a revolution.
Another important factor: Many utilities already are reducing carbon emissions significantly, and through detailed plans that do not result in a price hike for electricity consumers.
Another example, the $5.4 trillion it estimates to transition our electric grid comes seemingly from thin air, as NO SOURCES are documented for their generation cost assumptions.
The AAF analysis of the #GreenNewDeal spends some time doing basic multiplication on the impact of making all air travel unnecessary, a concept mentioned nowhere in the resolution text.
Any so-called "analysis" of the #GreenNewDeal that includes artificially inflated numbers that rely on lazy assumptions, incl. about policies that aren’t even in the resolution is bogus. Putting a price on a resolution of principles, not policies, is just Big Oil misinformation.
Scientists in the Trump administration and around the word agree that climate change is an existential threat and we have only a short time to take action to prevent its worst consequences. #GreenNewDeal

Declaring a fake national emergency and spending unappropriated funds on a wall unconstitutionally usurps Congress’s power of the purse and is just the latest example of this President’s excessive overreach and misuse of executive power.
The real national emergency is the political emergency President Trump created with his campaign promise to build a southern border wall. Declarations of national emergencies are for true national emergencies, like 9/11 or Hurricane Katrina, not for political cover.

The sun is setting on the dirty energy of the past. Today marks the dawn of a new era of climate action. When we look back on today, this will be the moment we will be able to say that the political tide has turned on the rising seas. #GreenNewDeal
We need massive renewable energy deployment. Wind, solar, offshore wind, storage batteries. Our energy future will not be found in the dark of a mine, but in the light of the sun. We have acted on this scale before, and we must do it again. #GreenNewDeal

.@RonWyden, @SenBlumenthal I asked Verizon, Sprint T-Mobile to explain potential violations of #NetNeutrality principles.They blamed consumers, networks... anything but themselves. Since they won’t fully disclose their practices, we’re asking the FCC to investigate.
Opioid-detecting scanners, funded by my bipartisan INTERDICT Act, were instrumental in making the largest fentanyl bust in U.S. history. This is how to stop drugs at the border — with 21st century technology, not a wall.

12 years from now, we could be listening to a President delivering the #SOTU, telling us that the worst effects of climate change have become irreversible. Or we could be celebrating the transformational action we took to save the planet. It’s up to us.
Withdrawing from the INF Treaty paves the way for a new arms race. It doesn't make America safer. It is a tragedy that makes the world more dangerous. #SOTU
Investing in infrastructure is long overdue. But any infrastructure bill MUST confront climate change. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to literally rebuild America and pave the way for an efficient, resilient, vibrant future. We cannot afford to miss it. #SOTU
