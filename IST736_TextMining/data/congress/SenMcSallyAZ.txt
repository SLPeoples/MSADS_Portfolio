(2/2) I support @POTUS’s goal, which is to further fund border security. I will continue to study the emergency declaration and additional funding proposal to ensure it increases border security while not adversely impacting our military.
(1/2) Earlier this week I supported the spending measure that supplied $22.5 billion for border security. That was a good start, but more resources are needed to support our border patrol, which includes physical barriers and technology.
I voted today for a bipartisan funding bill that keeps our government open, and provides a down payment on resources necessary to secure our southern border. Read my full statement below:
Thank you to Rafael Rivera of @BPUnion for stopping by today to discuss the situation in the #YumaSector. We will continue working to see that our border patrol agents @CBPArizona officers have the tools resources they need to defend our national security.

I cannot imagine our service members going to work not knowing if their families are going to be homeless the next day. These companies need to fix these problems or they are done.
I am disgusted by the reports of what some of our military families have been forced to endure in on-base housing. Today, I spoke to military spouses suffering from this crisis. If anyone living on base in AZ is having issues like this, please call my office: (602) 952-2410.

She has developed a well-deserved reputation as a thoughtful careful judge, she will be an excellent addition to the 9th Circuit.

Great work by @CBPArizona officers. Upgrading and modernizing our ports of entry must be part of our plan to secure the border so our officers can continue to prevent these types of harmful drugs from making their way into our communities.
Gov. Northam's comments condoning infanticide were shocking indefensible. There's no situation in which killing a newborn child should be legal the fact that the chief exec. of a state callously expressed support for such a policy is deeply disturbing.
I welcomed the chance to meet with attorney general nominee Bill Barr today. He is well-qualified, particularly given his exemplary service as AG for President George H.W. Bush. I am hopeful his confirmation process moves quickly. Read more:

(2/2) These negotiations must be in good faith and result in resources to secure our southern border.
(1/2) The short-term CR just announced by @POTUS and agreed to by all parties is the right way forward. It will reopen the government immediately, back pay those impacted and comes with a strong commitment to go to House/Senate conference on the Homeland Security spending bill.
Today, I took to the Senate Floor to urge Members of both parties to come together work around the clock until we reach a solution that reopens the government secures the southern border. See my remarks here:
(4/4) I will continue to work with members of both sides of the aisle and the administration to end this stalemate, open up the government and secure our border.
(3/4) Advancing politically charged messaging bills while our Border Patrol agents, CBP officers and other federal employees are not receiving a paycheck is not negotiating in good faith to solve this issue now.
(2/4) I opposed the temporary measure put forward by Minority Leader @SenSchumer because it fails to address the security and humanitarian crisis we face in our Arizona communities along the border.
(1/4) I voted for a proposal to immediately re-open the gov't, secure our southern border, and provide humanitarian assistance. This compromise plan also would have provided legal status stability for those covered by DACA TPS while we work to find a permanent solution.
