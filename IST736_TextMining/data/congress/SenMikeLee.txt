This is a complete subject change  from the claims in your original tweets, @SenTomCotton. You clearly have some concerns with the bill, and I look forward to debating all of them on the Senate floor.
Look forward to debating this with you on the Senate floor!
Read the bill. Earning time credits does not grant an inmate release. Inmates must still undergo risk assessment and be deemed low-risk offenders.
If @SenTomCotton has good faith problems with this bill then he should welcome a full and open debate on the Senate floor where he can offer amendments to provisions he finds objectionable. But first this bill needs to be brought to the Senate floor so debate can begin. /END
Nothing in the First Step Act gives inmates early release. It only incentivizes participation in recidivism reduction programs. At all times the Bureau of Prisons retains all authority over who does and does not qualify for early release. 5/
What the First Step Act does do is encourage rehabilitation by incentivizing inmates to participate in recidivism reduction programs by giving them time credits that can help them qualify for prerelease custody. 4/
Second, and more importantly, the First Step Act does not “give early release” to anyone. Anyone claiming it does, does not understand how the bill works. 3/
First, the House Judiciary committee passed the First Step Act out of committee on May 9 of this year, and the Senate Judiciary Committee passed the highly similar Sentencing and Corrections Act out of committee on Feb 15 of this year. These are not new policies. 2/

RT @GlenMillsABC4: #Utah senators weigh in during heated hearing for #SCOTUS nominee. #utpol @abc4utah @senorrinhatch @SenMikeLee
Here’s a quick update on today’s #SCOTUS hearing so far:
There’s a better way for the #Senate to approach its work. This process should be about a jurist’s qualifications, character, and approach to judging. It should not be about results in a select number of cases.
This undermines the legitimacy of the courts. Over time, no free people would accept a judiciary that simply imposes its own preferences on the country, absent fidelity to legal principle.
Every current member of the Supreme Court has adhered to a similar principle.
Sure enough, last term in Ortiz v. United States, #SCOTUS considered a case implicating the scope of Marbury. Likewise, Justice Ginsburg created the so-called “Ginsburg standard”—no previews, forecasts, or hints.
Nominees, for the most part, have resisted trading confirmation in exchange for promises on how they’ll vote. To give two famous examples: Justice Scalia refused to say whether Marbury v. Madison was settled law, on the ground that it could come before him.
This history shows that, over the better part of a century, the Judiciary Committee has gradually created a norm in which members demand that nominees talk about specific cases in return for favorable treatment.
Without getting into the gory details, suffice to say that Senator Ted Kennedy and Judge Bork did not agree on constitutional law. Kennedy’s response was to savage – unfairly – the results he thought Bork would reach.
Twenty-eight years later, the Senate considered Robert Bork’s nomination. This was another turning point, and in my view, remains a rock-bottom moment for the Senate.
Justice Stewart’s 1959 nomination was another turning point. Senators seeking to resist Brown v. Board of Education wanted to grill Stewart about his views on integration. Others wanted to grill Stewart about his views on national security.
But Senators also worried that Frankfurter was a radical based on his defense of anarchists in court. So again, Senators wanted assurances Frankfurter would reach certain results. Frankfurter, however, declined to engage w/Senators insisted his public record spoke for itself
The next important moment was in 1939, when Justice Frankfurter became the first #SCOTUS nominee to testify before the Senate. At the time, Frankfurter was controversial in part because he was he was born overseas.
They didn’t ask Brandeis to testify, but asked outside witnesses to talk about his nomination.
But Senators also wanted to determine whether Brandeis would use a seat on #SCOTUS to advocate for progressive causes he championed as a public-interest attorney. They wanted to know how he would vote in particular cases.
The first #SCOTUS confirmation hearing occurred in 1916, when Justice Brandeis was nominated. Brandeis was controversial for several reasons—including, it has to be said, because he was Jewish.
When you look at the history, that is precisely why confirmation hearings developed—so that Senators could ask nominees how they would vote in particular cases.
Some of these unfair questions will ask him to promise to vote a certain way in particular cases likely to come before the Court.
Over the next few days, senators will ask Judge #Kavanaugh questions about #SCOTUS cases, his record, and his qualifications. Some of these questions will be fair. Many others will be unfair.
What is the real context of today’s #SCOTUS hearing? Here are some facts:

The Committee is acting in a manner that is principled and consistent with Senate precedent. All members of the Senate have the ability to fully and fairly review the materials relevant to Kavanaugh’s judicial history.
None of these papers will shine light on his legal approach. Being the inbox and outbox for a President doesn’t include giving legal advice; that’s the role for White House counsel, not the Staff Secretary.
Democrats have made it clear that their goal is to bury the Committee in paper, just to delay a vote. Their minds were made up before Kavanaugh was even nominated. They don’t want to see the papers, they want to see his nomination stalled.
