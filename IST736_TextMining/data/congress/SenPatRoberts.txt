Thank you @jackiemcclaskey for your advice and counsel!
We have made tough choices, being judicious with the scarce resources we have on behalf of the taxpayer.   “This may not be the best possible #FarmBill.  But, it is the best bill possible under these circumstances.
This is what happens when the Congress works in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion.  This is a good #FarmBill that accomplishes what we set out to do – provide certainty and predictability for farmers, families, and rural communities.
The #FarmBill focuses on program integrity and commonsense investments to strengthen our nutrition programs to ensure the long-term success of those in need of assistance.
more #FarmBill:This Farm Bill meets the needs of producers across all regions and all crops.  And, it ensures that our voluntary conservation programs are keeping farm land in operation while protecting our agriculture lands, forests, and other natural resources.
On the #FarmBill: The goal, the responsibility, the absolute requirement is to provide farmers, ranchers, growers and everyone within America’s agriculture and food value chain certainty and predictability during these very difficult times.
