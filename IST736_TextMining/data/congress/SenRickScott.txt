La interrupción energética en #Venezuela es solo otro ejemplo de la incompetencia y desprecio de @NicolasMaduro por el pueblo venezolano.Esto perjudica a los más vulnerables. Maduro necesita dejar acusar a otros y darse cuenta de que ha perdido por completo el control.
The country-wide outage in #Venezuela is just another example of @NicolasMaduro's incompetence and disregard for the Venezuelan people. This hurts the most vulnerable. Maduro needs to stop pointing fingers and realize he has lost complete control.
