My committee’s investigation and report on the use of fiancé and spousal visas to facilitate child marriage and human trafficking has highlighted these problems and will hopefully result in passage of legislation to help prevent this abuse in the future. 
#InternationalWomensDay should be a reminder that America needs to lead by example to empower and inspire women around the globe.
Russia has shown that it can — and will — coerce nations that are dependent upon its energy. Countering the destabilizing influence that Russia’s energy dominance has in the region is important for Europe and U.S. national security interests.
We do have a crisis at the border.  Democrats have their heads in the sand when they say this is a manufactured crisis.

We not only need better barriers, but we need to fix our broken immigration laws that incentivize and reward people for coming into this country illegally.
This graph clearly shows we have a growing humanitarian crisis at our southern border.
The only way to avoid legal wrangling and provide a clear resolution for Wisconsin is to pass legislation to allow the state to move forward with a wolf population management plan. My bill has bipartisan support.  Read more here
Pleased the Interior Department will propose a new rule to delist the gray wolf from the Endangered Species Act. It's a positive development but liberal activists will surely sue and yet again seek out a sympathetic federal judge to block the decision.
This is not a manufactured crisis.
That’s the same number for ALL of 2014 when President Obama declared a“humanitarian crisis at the border.” This IS a growing crisis. We need better barriers and need to fix our broken immigration laws that incentivize and reward people for coming into this country illegally.
Border security is not a manufactured crisis. This graph shows you the problem.In just the first 4 months of fiscal year 2019, we’ve already apprehended 120,000 unaccompanied minors and people coming in as family units between ports of entry on our southwest border.

@LindseyGrahamSC @VP Here's what @LindseyGrahamSC is talking about....
On the same day we’re holding a field hearing to talk about the success of school choice in Washington DC, news that @GovEvers wants to freeze expansion of Wisconsin’s trail blazing voucher and charter schools.
Today’s #HSGAC field hearing focuses on the 15th anniversary of the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program and how school choice is providing hope for many DC families.
We're on location at St. Thomas More Catholic School this afternoon in Washington, D.C. to examine how school choice has changed lives these past 15 years it’s been in effect here.
Fascinating thread from a fellow Member of Congress. It’s unfortunate @GovEvers doesn’t agree that border security is a top priority, and has decided to withdraw them from their important mission.
More than a million Americans have fought and died for our inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Today’s vote to protect a baby born alive is an unfortunate reminder that we will need to keep fighting for the most basic of those rights, life.
Securing our borders is a top priority of our nation, and I'm proud of Wisconsin's National Guard for playing a valued role. It's unfortunate Governor Evers doesn't agree, and has decided to withdraw them from their important mission.

We will continue our fight in the Senate and work with @JimPressOffice in the House to pass the SOFA Act. Too many Americans have suffered from the epidemic of fentanyl overdoses.
He never lived in Washington and had the shortest inaugural address in history. In honor of #PresidentsDay, here are 10 facts about our first president.
"Fentanyl is so deadly it has been weaponized and is classifiable as chemical weapons." Dr. Tim Westlake's op-ed is a chilling call to action for Congress to pass the SOFA Act.
Talked with @MeetThePress from @MunSecConf about the president’s national emergency declaration and the humanitarian crisis at our southern border.
Attorneys General in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico think the SOFA Act is a good idea. So why hasn't Congress passed it?

Now is the time to finally pass the SOFA Act. @JimPressOffice and I will continue to work to close this deadly fentanyl loophole. Thank you Dr. Tim Westlake for this passionate call to action.
"The SOFA Act would unplug the entire fentanyl machine and shut down illicit development and production of deadly fentanyls." Read Dr. Tim Westlake's passionate argument for why we need to pass the SOFA Act.
Now we must devote our energy to a thorough process addressing the complex problems of border security and legal illegal immigration. I look forward to working with the admin. colleagues on both sides of the aisle to accurately define the problems and find effective solutions
I continue to be amazed at the dysfunction of Washington D.C. I primarily voted for the government funding bill to move us past the current appropriation impasse and avoid another shutdown.
William Barr is eminently qualified, and he’s demonstrated a commitment to justice and the rule of law – not partisan politics – during his decades of public service. I’m pleased he was confirmed on a bipartisan basis to again serve as attorney general.
Staff is at the Wisconsin Dells Municipal Building right now with our mobile office helping constituents.

This issue is too important to WI farmers, ranchers, loggers sportsmen for me to support this legislation in the absence of a solution. I'll continue to fight for gray wolf listing decisions to be made by wildlife experts now that its population is a threat to livestock pets.
A bipartisan amendment I introduced would’ve ensured that wolf management plans based on federal and state wildlife expertise could move forward without legal ambiguity, but the amendment was not included.
While the Natural Resources Management Act included a number of good provisions, it did not address a critical issue for Wisconsin: delisting the gray wolf as an endangered species in the western Great Lakes region.

Paging passenger @SenSchumer? Please explain to your fellow New Yorkers why you blocked a bill to pay air traffic controllers yesterday.
Curious if @SenSchumer can make it back to New York this weekend? He could have avoided this yesterday, but instead played politics with people’s paychecks and blocked an attempt to pay all federal employees working during the shutdown, including the air traffic controllers.
.@SenSchumer needs to explain why he thinks more than 400,000 federal workers, including air traffic controllers, should not be paid. Yesterday, he blocked an attempt to pass the Shutdown Fairness Act that would have paid them. It's unconscionable to make people work without pay.
