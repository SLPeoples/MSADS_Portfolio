This is yet another example of the systematic healthcare sabotage that Republicans have been implementing since day one of the Trump administration, but this time, women’s reproductive rights are the casualty.

Our solution may not be the only one or even the best one, but it was intended as a wake-up call to corporate America that they must be part of the solution, not the problem.I welcome their feedback.
Fact #3: Emergence of new businesses has declined in recent years. Given that rates of buybacks dividends are going up, you’d think the rates of new businesses would be consistently going up, too, if shareholders were using capital from the buybacks to reinvest in new ventures.
Fact #2: Workers’ wages have not kept up with productivity.
Fact #1: Income inequality has grown dramatically over the past several decades as the distribution of wealth and income has skewed more and more to the top.
I’ve heard criticism both publicly and privately that suggests that — when corporate executives and shareholders are given free rein to decide how to appropriately reallocate capital offered through stock buybacks and dividends — it works out best for society.I simply disagree.

I'm so honored to have invited the Governor of Puerto Rico @RicardoRossello to tonight's #SOTU.Governor Rossello's attendance serves as a reminder to @realDonaldTrump and Republicans that our work in Puerto Rico is far from over.
Every president uses the State of the Union to set goals, but few have done it so cheaply and indifferently.Many of the promises from President @realDonaldTrump's last #SOTU were discarded mere weeks after they were made.
Meet Ronan Byrne.He’s a Long Island air traffic controller father of 4 sons under 5 years old.Even uncertain when they’d receive their paychecks, federal employees like Ronan showed up for work every day of the #TrumpShutdown.I'm so proud to bring Ronan with me to #SOTU.

RIGHT NOW: I’m sitting down with @SenSanders.The past two years have been extremely disappointing for millions of workers. We’re pushing legislation that demands that corporations address the needs of their workers before their wealthy stockholders.
At a time of huge income and wealth inequality, Americans should be outraged that profitable corporations are laying off workers while spending billions to boost their stock’s value to further enrich the wealthy few. My @NYTimes op-ed with @SenSanders:
Whether the state of the Trump economy,the state of our healthcare system,or the state of the Trump Administration,the state of our union is in need of drastic repair.Democrats will fight for workers, healthcare, and government accountability.
I am old enough to remember when Republicans and the WSJ claimed the Trump tax scam would lead to a huge boost in worker wages and a “miracle” for the middle class.But then corporations used tax cuts for stock buybacks and this happened...
In this Congress, @SenSanders and I will push legislation that demands that corporations commit to addressing the needs of their workers and communities before wealthy stockholders.Our @NYTimes op-ed on limiting corporate stock buybacks:

Stanley Hill was a powerful warrior for working families.He led NYC's largest public employees union @DistCouncil37 for more than a decade.And his work left an indelible mark on New York.My prayers go to his family and everyone who knew loved him.
Cold temperatures and lots of snow is nothing Western New Yorkers can’t handle, but please use caution. Bundle up and stay safe!
Next Tuesday night, @realDonaldTrump will be the warm-up act for the real deal:Stacey
I am proud to announce that @AGBecerra will deliver the Spanish response to the State of the Union.Xavier Becerra embodies the promise of America and his moral and vigilant leadership is a critical marker for all who believe that our country’s best days are still ahead of us.

Stacey Abrams is a great spokesperson, incredible leaderShe has led the charge for voting rightsShe knows what working class middle class people go through@SpeakerPelosi I are excited she’s agreed to give the Democratic response to @realDonaldTrump’s State of the Union
Our economy suffered an $11 billion loss in the shutdown.Individual costs are harder to see. Who knows how many fed workers missed a doctor’s appointment, fell behind on payments.And @realDonaldTrump still must explain how he'll pay fed contractors.
What @TheJusticeDept did with Huawei is right on.I know it’s tempting, President @realDonaldTrump, but when China calls and begs you to back off, don’t do it (like when you backed off with ZTE).
But for TWO Senate Republicans, the U.S. Senate could have prevented: - Sanctions relief on 3 Russian companies.- Purportedly a billion dollars of debt relief for Oleg Deripaska, an individual reportedly under investigation by the special
This shutdown cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, including $3 billion in economic activity that can't be recovered.Let me repeat: The #TrumpShutdown cost the U.S. economy $11 billion.What a devastating pointless exercise this has been.@realDonaldTrump: No more shutdowns.
President @realDonaldTrump's shutdown caused serious damage to our economy.If he didn’t appreciate the error of his ways after seeing federal workers suffering from his needless shutdown, maybe this economic damage he inflicted will set him straight.No more Trump Shutdowns.
Republicans promised that their tax giveaway to corporate America and the wealthiest few was going to be a ‘middle class miracle.’That was a lie. American workers were promised a $4,000 raise. Many got a pink slip instead.They have to fix this. Now.
74 years ago today, Auschwitz was liberated.We must remember. And we must teach our children about the Holocaust to make sure such evil is never revisited on the Jewish people or on any other people.#WeRemember #HolocaustRemembranceDay
I’m so proud of this Brooklyn baby as he keeps exploring his new world.
It’s hard to believe my grandson Noah is 2 months old.
I hope that President @realDonaldTrump has heard our federal workers and their families. I hope he's heard Democrats in Congress.No more Trump shutdowns.No more holding federal workers hostage.
As Democrats have said all along, the solution to this impasse was to separate funding the government from our disagreements over border security. This agreement endorses that position.I’m about to talk to the press with @SpeakerPelosi. Watch:
The longest shutdown in American history will finally end. The president has agreed to our request to open the government then debate border security. This is great news for 800,000 federal workers millions of Americans who depend on government services.
We need to end this #TrumpShutdown.This afternoon for the 1st time since @realDonaldTrump shut government down, the Senate will have a chance to vote on a clean bill to re-open government provide disaster aid.I hope the Senate rises to the occasion. 
Wilbur Ross is @realDonaldTrump’s Secretary of Commerce.Wilbur Ross is a billionaire.And this is billionaire Wilbur Ross saying he doesn’t understand why federal workers not getting paid during the #TrumpShutdown don’t just take out loans *to feed their families*.Unreal.
This is President @realDonaldTrump’s former Chief of Staff.Who left just recently.Calling for the President to re-open the government.Without the wall.
Our uninsured rate just hit a 4-year high.Why? Years of GOP sabotage to our health care system.AND @realDonaldTrump's admin just proposed decreasing tax credits that help Americans pay for health care.Enough. Stop sabotaging Americans’ health care.
First, @realDonaldTrump shut down the government.Then, he rejected offers to reopen it.Now, he’s demanding his that the government stay closed unless he gets his way.Mr. President: Stop holding federal workers hostage and re-open the government.
The Senate will have a chance to vote on a clean proposal to reopen the government.It is a way to reopen the government while we resolve our differences.If you're worried about federal employees going without pay in the #TrumpShutdown, this is the way.
Moose. Mike Mussina. It’s an amazing night for @Yankees pitchers. New York couldn’t be prouder of you! Congratulations on the Hall of Fame. You deserve it.
5 World Series rings.A 13-time All Star.The @MLB's all-time leader in saves.A life story that is the American Dream come true.The 1st player ever unanimously elected to the Hall of Fame.New York and the @Yankees couldn't be prouder of you, Mariano Rivera. #HOF2019
The Senate will have a chance Thursday to vote on 2 bills:1. @realDonaldTrump’s plan. Not reasonable. Not a compromise. Never intended to pass. It’s merely an attempt to save face.2. A clean bill to re-open government provide disaster aid.Will @SenateGOP finally join us?
