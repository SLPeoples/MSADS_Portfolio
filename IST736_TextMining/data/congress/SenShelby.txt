Our hearts are heavy following the loss of Mike Adcock, a good friend and a true son of Alabama. Mike was beloved by all who worked with him and certainly by my staff and me. Please keep his family – Cynthia, Avery, and Alley – in your thoughts and prayers at this time.
Job openings in the U.S. are at a record high! For the 6th consecutive month, there are more job openings than there are unemployed Americans looking for work. We have successfully added over 4.2 million jobs since the 2016 election. #Jobs
Saddened to hear about the horrible shooting in Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue. We as a nation must strongly condemn acts of terrorism and hate in our communities and in places of worship, and stand together for unity and peace. My heart goes out to all of those affected.
Thank you to the excellent law enforcement authorities who brought the mail bomb suspect into custody. They did an outstanding job. Violence and domestic terrorism in all forms are not welcome in our country.

Under #GOP leadership, Congress reformed America’s tax code for the first time in 31 yrs – delivering historic tax relief for families, workers, job creators. The #TaxCutsandJobsAct is working to revitalize our economy helping Americans keep more of their hard-earned money.
Joined my #GulfCoast Senate colleagues in pressing @CommerceGov to properly implement U.S. antidumping laws in an effort to ensure our #catfish producers are competing on a level playing field. Read here:
This Congress, we've provided certainty to the American people with a restored regular order appropriations process, passing 9 of 12 approps bills thru the Senate sending 5 to POTUS's desk – enacting the most on-time funding bills in 22yrs funding 75% of the govt on schedule.
One huge #accomplishment achieved this Congress is the successful transformation of our nation’s courts. Nearly 1 out of every 6 circuit court judges have been appointed by President @realDonaldTrump confirmed by the #GOP-led Senate.
This Congress, our list of #accomplishments keeps growing! We have made significant progress for the American people by passing bills to improve the FAA our nation's water infrastructure, provide for farmers, combat the opioid crisis, reform our tax code more!

Relieved to hear that Pastor Andrew Brunson of North Carolina has finally been released after being detained in Turkey for 2 years. This is a huge win for the USA. I signed a letter to President Erdoğan in April advocating for his release. Great news!
Proud to have confirmed Judge Liles Burke to be a District Judge for the Northern District of AL. He is extremely qualified for this high honor, having served as a judge in Alabama for over a decade. Congratulations to him on this prestigious achievement!
Thankful for first responders those working to repair the damage of #HurricaneMichael. My thoughts and prayers go out to all of those affected in #Alabama throughout the Southeast.
Great news for #Alabama – @ULALaunch has been selected by the @USAirForce as one of the top space launch companies in the LSA program. This means more funding for ULA to develop the #Vulcan rocket, which could eventually replace the Russian RD-180.
The Senate today passed a comprehensive water infrastructure bill that will improve our community water systems authorize impt programs that’ll create jobs spur economic growth. This legislation benefits all 50 states! Heading now to @POTUS's desk.
