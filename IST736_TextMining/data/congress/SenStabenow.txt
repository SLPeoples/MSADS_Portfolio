About to join @AliVelshi live on @MSNBC to talk about this morning’s @SenateFinance hearing on the high cost of prescription drugs. Tune in!
The Republican tax bill gave Big Pharma a huge tax cut and the seven CEOs who are testifying today made over $100 million in compensation in 2017. Can someone explain why they aren’t bringing down drug prices?
It’s pretty clear. Big Pharma charges more because it can. People in Michigan deserve better and they should be able to afford their medicine here at home.
I just asked the AbbVie CEO in @SenateFinance: why don’t you offer the same low price for Americans? He couldn’t answer but listen for yourself here.
Humira is the world’s best-selling drug. It treats arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. AbbVie Pharmaceuticals, which makes Humira, is offering up to 80% discounts to people in Europe to buy Humira.
American taxpayers have contributed more than $200 billion for Big Pharma to develop new medication. What do we get in return? The highest drug prices in the world. As I said just now in @SenateFinance, that’s outrageous.
Exciting to see @FiatChrysler_NA investing $4.5 billion in five Michigan plants - creating thousands of new jobs and countless opportunities for the future of manufacturing in our great

Not only has William Barr not committed to releasing the full report, but he also believes the President is above the law. No one is above the law – especially the President.

I wasn’t sleeping. I was trying not to scream.
Our love and prayers are with you and John.
I am deeply concerned about the direction of our country reflected in the President’s #SOTU. We need to come together and find bipartisan solutions on issues important to Michigan like fixing our nation’s infrastructure, lowering the cost of health care keeping jobs in the U.S.
Our bill would make sure that Michigan priorities like the Soo Locks, dredging of our harbors, and stopping Asian carp aren’t zeroed out for President Trump’s unnecessary wall.
An emergency declaration by President Trump would divert critical funding away from Michigan.
Very concerning that special interests like the Koch Brothers are influencing our nation’s response to PFAS contamination in our drinking water. The Administration should be putting the health and safety of our families
I agree. It is outrageous that corporate shareholders are getting richer while workers are not being paid a decent wage.
Looking forward to watching all those with Michigan connections play today in the @Superbowl!
Today we @GoRedforWomen and stand together to raise awareness for women’s heart health.
If the president declares a national emergency to build the wall, I will strongly oppose taking away funding from critical Army Corps projects like the Soo Locks to pay for it.
I’m encouraged by the bipartisan effort to provide funding for smart, effective security at both our northern and southern borders. Leader McConnell needs to make sure this gets a vote.

I agree! I cosponsored @SenatorBaldwin’s Made In America bill last Congress to make sure the federal government is buying American products.
This is wrong. We should be making it easier for Americans to vote and participate in our democracy!
More than 50 years ago the #EqualPay Act passed in an attempt to close the gender wage gap. It’s 2019 women still make only 80 cents per dollar men make for the same job! I cosponsored the #PaycheckFairness Act to hold employers accountable ensure equal pay for equal work.

Holding federal workers’ wages hostage was wrong! First step now is to pay them asap. Next step is to make sure this never happens again.
Just voted to reopen the government and end this terrible shutdown. We all support strong border security but President Trump needs to stop holding federal workers and their wages hostage.
You mean like what we just did with the bipartisan Farm Bill? The President can give me a call anytime about working together on the Soo Locks and other MI priorities.
It’s time for President Trump to end this shutdown so federal workers like Agent Maitland can get paid for the important work they are doing to protect and serve our communities.
Border Patrol Agent Brian Maitland and Monroe County Sheriff’s Deputy Brian Sroka are true heroes whose actions helped save a man’s life.

The Senate just passed legislation I cosponsored to make sure government workers affected by the shutdown get back pay. The President should sign it immediately. Most importantly, he needs to act now and reopen the government.
It would be outrageous to divert U.S. Army Corps money from critical priorities for Michigan like the Soo Locks, dredging of our harbors, infrastructure for our ports and waterways, and plans to stop Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes.
None of this has to be happening. The President can easily end the #TrumpShutdown by signing the bipartisan government funding bills that have been passed by the House and Senate.
And beyond SNAP, school meals, support for women, infants, and children, and food for seniors are all at risk if this shutdown does not come to an end.
The #TrumpShutdown threatens the 38 million people who rely on SNAP to put food on the table, including many seniors, children, and people with disabilities. They should have long-term certainty that food assistance will be available.
It also means many routine food safety inspections have been halted
The #TrumpShutdown means pollution inspectors aren’t on the job, potentially putting our health and safety at risk.
Homeowners in small towns and rural communities can’t get the housing loans they need to pay their mortgages because the USDA Rural Development office is shut down.
Local Farm Service offices are closed and farmers can’t apply for loans they need. Dairy farmers can't access additional support they received in the new Farm Bill. And farmers can't count on important crop reports to make decisions about the upcoming planting season.
Every day that USDA is shut down is another day that the improvements we made in the 2018 Farm Bill are delayed and the situation gets more serious for farmers and families.
The #TrumpShutdown could even hurt our country’s credit rating the longer it goes on, making it more expensive for families and companies to borrow money.
The #TrumpShutdown means many Michigan workers can’t pay their bills, some people have been forced to get temporary jobs, and small business owners are losing business because they depend on spending by federal employees.
In just two days, the #TrumpShutdown will become the longest government shutdown ever. Here are just a few examples of how it is hurting our country.
I am deeply concerned that he will continue Scott Pruitt’s legacy of undermining protections for our air and water if confirmed as EPA Administrator.
The next head of the EPA must stand with us to protect our Great Lakes and make decisions based on sound science. I voted against Andrew Wheeler to be Deputy EPA Administrator because I had no confidence he would do that.
Today and every day, I am grateful for the men and women who keep us safe. #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay
Nothing new after the President’s speech tonight. We all support strong border security and can continue to debate what that looks like. But it’s time for President Trump to end this shutdown.

Last night, I voted to advance a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill. It’s called the #FirstStepAct because it takes the first step towards reforming and modernizing our criminal justice system.

I voted against Ryan Zinke’s nomination and it’s past time that he step down. The next Secretary of the Interior needs to stand up for our Great Lakes and public lands, not cozy up to big oil and gas companies.
