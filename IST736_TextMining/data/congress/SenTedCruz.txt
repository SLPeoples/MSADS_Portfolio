What we have here in America is unique—and it is very much worth fighting for. In case you missed my remarks, watch them here --&gt;
The story of America is a story of risking everything for freedom. Because of stories like my family’s and others throughout America, we have created a diverse society dedicated to protecting the liberties we all enjoy under the Constitution.
This week, I was proud to address the @LatinoCoalition @JobCreatorsUSA's 2019 Legislative Summit where I shared my family’s experience living under brutal dictatorships in Cuba and their journey to our great nation.

That’s why I intend to reintroduce with @SenCortezMasto   my bipartisan E-FRONTIER Act in the coming weeks. If adopted, the E-FRONTIER Act will prevent massive government overreach in the private sector, and maintain Congress’ important role in the decision making process.
Any proposals that consider nationalizing these networks or rely upon the heavy-hand of the US gov in picking winners and losers is certain to have a chilling effect on private investment result in a radical shift in the management of our nation’s telecommunication’s networks.
If we are to remain the global telecommunications leader and compete with China, the private sector must continue to build, deploy, and secure 5G networks moving forward.
There is no question that our American system of free enterprise has been instrumental in establishing the United States as the global leader in mobile broadband technology since 2009.

The United States will pursue and try sanctions busters and, if the Canadian courts approve Meng’s extradition, she will experience something that her fellow Chinese citizens never get: a fair and open legal process.
China’s Communist Party has been exerting enormous pressure on our Canadian allies to release her, but the seriousness of the charges against her merit the scrutiny they are receiving.
I commend the Canadian government for initiating an extradition case for Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. --&gt;
I will continue to work with President Trump and my colleagues to turn up the pressure on him and his regime until they agree to the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.
We must also continue to be unflinching and unapologetic in identifying, condemning, and punishing Kim’s human rights atrocities, including the torture and murder of Otto Warmbier.
POTUS should accept nothing less and, if Kim agrees, the final terms should be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent.
@realDonaldTrump If Kim is interested in sanctions relief, he must fully disclose his nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, permit unrestricted access to relevant sites, and cooperate with verification organizations ensuring complete denuclearization.

It is my hope that this bill will not only incentivize voluntary investment in our students, but will also energize a new era of opportunity in education and provide a brighter future for all Americans. --&gt;
My bill allows for scholarships to give elementary and secondary students a personalized education experience, as well as scholarships for career and technical education, apprenticeships, certifications, and other forms of workforce training for postsecondary students.
I introduced the Education Freedom Scholarships Opportunity Act which will drive increased investment in students by creating a tax credit for taxpayers that donate to scholarship organizations supporting K-12 education as well as secondary post-secondary workforce training.
I believe every student has the fundamental right to a quality education, as a quality education is the gateway to the American dream and stable, family-sustaining employment.

I look forward to working together to continue Small Refinery Exemptions, consistent with federal law and recent court decisions, and to reset the statutory conventional biofuel volume at a level that is aligned with market realities and does not exceed 15 billion gallons.
Over the course of the advice consent process, I appreciated his understanding of the plight of refinery workers facing crushing RINs prices under the Renewable Fuel Standard his ongoing dedication to finding a win-win solution that helps both corn farmers refinery workers.
This translates to billions of dollars in savings in regulatory costs for Americans across the country.
Pleased the Senate confirmed Andrew Wheeler to be the next EPA Administrator. He has displayed strong commitment to protecting the environment, while also providing businesses, local govs landowners greater certainty in EPA’s programs through the agency’s deregulatory actions.
“Our bill also includes workforce training organizations—such as a trade schools or apprenticeship programs – as eligible under this tax credit.”
By incentivizing giving, this legislation would raise more money for students, reach more families open up a new era of freedom in education.
Our legislation creates a federal tax credit for taxpayers that donate to scholarship organizations supporting K-12 education post-secondary workforce education options.
I am proud to introduce the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act in the US Senate, which focuses on making quality schooling and workforce training more affordable than ever for all Americans.

I will continue fighting to secure our southern border. Democrats’ intransigence has left the president with no other choice but to take executive action. I’m a constitutionalist have long advocated that every president be bound by the Constitution and federal laws.
I have long called for building a wall as a necessary step in stopping the flow of illegal immigration into our country defending our border. Indeed, I introduced the #ELCHAPOAct the WALL Act–2 bills which would offset the cost of completing the wall and securing our border.
This bill does not deliver on the promises we made to the American people to keep our communities safe. Washington Democrats do not want to secure the border, but Texans and Americans do.
The American people gave Congress a clear mandate: #SecureTheBorder build the wall. These are critical priorities – for Texas and the country.   Unfortunately, this spending bill is a bad deal, and fails to reflect these priorities by not sufficiently securing the border.
