Some housing providers go to young people in the military and urge them to sign an NDA in exchange for a bonus or payment if they don’t bring up housing issues. I want the NDAs rescinded in the next 30 days because this is not how we treat our men and women in uniform.
This kind of centralized government approach might work in China, but the last thing we need is for big government to start punishing America’s innovators and taking away choices from the American people. Hard pass.

Mattis has helped transform the Pentagon over the last two years, prioritizing the personnel, training, readiness modernization of our Armed Forces. America is safer and more secure because of his tremendous leadership, and I am grateful for his service to our nation.
Jim Mattis is the definition of an American Patriot. From his enlistment in the Marine Corps to his service as Secretary of Defense, he has always served our nation with honor and integrity.

We cannot afford to repeat the mistake of the Obama Admin’s decision to prematurely withdraw from Iraq, which led to the rise of ISIS. I have concerns that withdrawal from Syria at the current time could lead to the resurgence of ISIS and provide a boost to Russia and Iran. (2/3)
