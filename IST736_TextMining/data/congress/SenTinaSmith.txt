Every corner of MN has been affected by winter weather, but recent blizzards extreme snowfall hit farmers in southeast MN particularly hard. So I visited the area w @GovTimWalz to get a better understanding of the situation see what we can do to
.@GovTimWalz agrees with me that even though it may be a snowy day in southeast Minnesota, a donut from Daube’s Bakery in Rochester can get you through any storm.
My message to women and girls everywhere on #InternationalWomensDay? Your voices are strong, but only if you use them. Be strong. We need you. More on what I told @Newsweek to mark this
Honored to take part in the Indigenous Women Have Always Been Leaders Conference today at the University of Minnesota to celebrate Indigenous women’s leadership. We have a lot of work to do to build upon the progress made by women and I’m ready to do that work. #IWD2019UMN
️ This is what I believe on #InternationalWomensDay, and every day.
@KateBolduan @sarahcwestwood @AshaRangappa_ @AnneMilgram @AlisonKosik @RanaForoohar @KaraScannell @SunlenSerfaty @kaitlancollins @brianstelter Thanks for having me on, @KateBolduan.
This Sunday, @RepDeanPhillips and I are going to give an update on how we’re fighting to extend critical humanitarian protections for Liberians before they would have to leave the country on 3/31. I hope you’ll join us.RSVP here:
SOOO glad to be home. Moose the dog. MN Boys HS Hockey. Fire in fireplace. Beer. Archie is making soup. It’s not snowing. Yet.
@Lija27 Thank you Lija for your tireless work to lower the cost of insulin. Know that I stand with you, and am committed to lowering prices. #insulin4all
@seiumn And thank you, @seiumn, for your relentless pursuit to stand up for Minnesota working families. When people organize for fairness and justice, they raise us all up.
Coya Knutson was Minnesota’s first female member of Congress. A real trailblazer. Despite great obstacles women in politics faced at the time she served in the 1950s, she succeeded in making a difference for the families and communities in her state. #WomensHistoryMonth
Imagine a kid sitting in class, trying to learn on an empty stomach. That gnawing hunger would make it pretty hard to do well. Unfortunately, w 1 in 6 kids in US facing hunger, this is reality for many. We must make sure kids are #PoweredByBreakfast. #NationalSchoolBreakfastWeek
#TBT to visiting the Moorhead @DairyQueen last year. Sure, snow was on the ground, but that didn’t stop me from enjoying some ice cream. The temperature was -9 on opening day this year (March 1), but there was still a line of people waiting for it to open at 9 am. #OnlyInMN
Closely monitoring implementation of the #FarmBill. Last week I talked to @USDA @SecretarySonny about the importance of providing certainty to #MNAg, especially dairy farmers, who’ve been hit hard.Have Qs about the #FarmBill? Email ag@smith.senate.gov.
Glad the House held a hearing today on immigration issues that need attention, like #DACA, Temporary Protected Status Deferred Enforced Departure (DED). Speaking of DED, the clock's ticking.  Trump must extend humanitarian protections for Liberians before they terminate 3/31.
50,000+ patients in Minnesota could lose access to critical health care services if the Trump Admin gets its way. People of color, folks living in rural areas low-income individuals will be hurt most. NOW’S THE TIME to make your voices heard.
The @FCC’s move to end #NetNeutrality protections last year was a direct attack on the entire principle of a free and open internet. I'm proud to help introduce @SenMarkey's bill today to restore the net neutrality protections that millions fought to establish. #SaveTheNet.
People with diabetes shouldn’t have to rally against the skyrocketing cost of insulin, hoping that it’ll help them afford the medication they need to live. It’s absurd. Know that I’m on your side, and pushing to give some much-needed relief to patients. #MNInsulin4All
On 3/31 many Liberians who've lived in MN legally for decades thanks to humanitarian protections will be forced to uproot the lives they’ve built move back to a country they don’t even know. I’m pressing to make sure this doesn’t happen. MN is their
Look at Readler’s record. He:•Worked to dismantle protections for ppl w preexisting conditions•Led efforts to end #DACA•Opposed protections against discrimination for LGBTQ Americans•Defended restrictive voting lawsI’ll be voting “no” on his nomination to 6th circuit.
Update: Minnesota 20 other states are taking legal action to block harmful changes that'd weaken a woman's right to make decisions for herself her family, drastically cut access to care in rural areas. We're in this fight together I won't back
Today my staff surprised me with a birthday celebration, complete with homemade bundt cakes (they were delicious). Looking forward to the year ahead, and thanks for the birthday wishes.
The high cost of insulin has made this life-saving drug unaffordable for many Minnesotans. So when I heard about @US_FDA’s proposed changes that'd make it harder for lower-cost, generic insulin products to come to market, I had to get involved. Pressing them to reverse course.
Alexa, play “Under Pressure” by Queen David Bowie.
A hearty State-of-Hockey Congratulations to @WhitecapsHockey, who in its first year in the @NWHL won the Regular Season Championship with a victory on Sunday. By finishing atop the standings, the team clinched the top seed as the playoffs begin.
#ICYMI, I sent out the February edition of my newsletter, “Notes From the Capitol.” Catch up on some of my latest work
Minnesota is leading the way when it comes to clean energy thanks to initiatives like @GovTimWalz’s #OneMinnesota Path to Clean Energy. I’m working to make sure the nation follows suit.
I disapprove some of Rep. Omar’s recent statements, but we need to strongly repudiate this hateful and violent
“There is no principled reason to leave contractors shortchanged while regular government employees are made whole." Agreed.Congress should take up my bipartisan bill to secure #BackPayNOW for fed contract workers. This is about common sense
The nearly day-long siege in Mogadishu has ended. My heart goes out to everyone affected by this heinous violence, including victims, their families, and Minnesota’s Somali-American community. I condemn this horrible act.
I always say that Minnesota is a leader when it comes to promoting clean, affordable renewable energy. Here’s another example of Minnesota leading the charge:
Broadband is a core economic issue. But without a grasp on which parts of the country—and Minnesota—do and do not have service, how can we effectively and efficiently deploy broadband to areas in need? Today, I asked @SecretarySonny what @USDA is doing to fix broadband mapping.
I've heard from a family who has to drive 50 miles to take its kids to child care folks who are paying about 1/3 of their income toward the cost of child care. That’s why I'm backing @PattyMurray's bill to expand access to child care and lower costs for families. #ChildCare4All
� Some US service members who cleaned up the radiation-exposed Marshall Islands were just wearing shorts, t-shirts boots. And many who helped clean up suffer from exposure to radiation nuclear waste. I have a bipartisan bill to get them proper care.
I want to tell you about Isabela, who lives in St. Paul. She fled Liberia during its civil war has been living here legally for 17 years. But the program that allows her many other Liberians to live in the US expires 3/31. This is wrong. Speak out make your voices heard.
Proud to have earned a 100% score on @LCVoters' 2018 #LCVScorecard. Next year I’d love to see all of my colleagues score the same.
EPA Administrator nominee Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, has a history of:✓ downplaying the risks of climate change✓ rolling back vehicle fuel efficiency standards✓ trying to roll back protections against mercury emissionsIt’ll be a definite “no” vote from me.
A donut a day helps keep democracy underway.
Today in Senate Banking I pressed Jerome Powell, Chair of the Fed Reserve Board of Govs, abt the need for investments in job training affordable child care in rural areas to address the growing number of U.S. farm bankruptcies in order to put rural America back on its feet.
This recent spike in allegations of sexual abuse of unaccompanied minors in custody of U.S Govt is SHAMEFUL. This isn't how we should treat children. I'm calling for a Health Cmte hearing on the negative health impacts of Trump's zero-tolerance
Can’t say I’m
� Neither of these options are good. I’m urging Trump to extend protections that have allowed Liberians to legally live in the U.S. Forcing them to return to the country they had to flee from decades ago will break up families and devastate communities.
Minnesotans are always willing to lend a helping hand, especially when winter snowstorms strike. Kudos to these kids.
Lawmakers shouldn't dictate what doctors can or cannot do to deliver the best medical care for women. We need to continue to trust women their doctors. I took to the Senate floor today to talk about this, I will continue to make my voice heard for women in MN and our nation.
“Be kind and love one another.” We’d all be better off if we took this advice from Red Lake Chairman Seki. Thanks, Chairman, for inviting me to attend this year’s State of the Band address. I look forward to our continued work
Hey MN, be careful out there.
Glad I got to visit Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig in Bena, Minnesota hear about the school’s priorities. In 2018, the school finally opened after being rebuilt. We must make sure every Native American student is attending a school we can be proud of, like this one.
Thanks to Chair Jackson and the talented, hardworking staff and students at Bug-O-Nay-Ge-Shig for showing me your school. With Al Franken and Rep. Betty McCollum you have created an amazing place.
Grateful for the opportunity to attend Red Lake's State of the Band Address. I feel a strong responsibility to use my position on the Senate Indian Affairs Cmte to lift up the voices of MN's 11 Dakota Ojibwe nations and its vibrant urban indigenous population.
It’s Friday afternoon and the Administration is again attacking women’s health care and limiting their freedom to make decisions for themselves and their families. It’s the 21st Century, and we should not go backwards.
Minnesota invented waterskiing, and apparently now this too? #OnlyInMN

Thank you @MPRnews for highlighting Minnesotans who are making history this #BlackHistoryMonth. An important and inspiring read. I hope you'll check it out. The impressive list of #changemakers includes:
My father read The Story of Ferdinand to me as a kid and it brought me so much joy. Excited for you to read it to Uly.
Moose thinks my husband Archie should turn the heat up. But he’s glad I made a fire.
#TBT to me at 13 skiing in Alaska, where I went to middle school (or Jr. High as we called it). I loved the snow, and still do. Which is good given our record-breaking snowy February.
Thank you for letting me stop by today, @MinneapolisFed. Really enjoyed the conversation I had with @neelkashkari, @atchourumoff, @abigailwozniak about work underway to boost access to affordable housing and child care, and to support tribes in Minnesota.
Well done, Steve Sack. #OnlyInMN
We need to support Minnesotans by making sure they can access mental health services when and where they need them. Thanks @bemidji for highlighting this effort at @BemidjiState to increase mental health services and stop the stigma.
@GopherWBB If only I could be in two places at once: very glad to be working in Minnesota this week but wish I was also in Washington so I could catch your game, @GopherWBB! Good luck.
It’s 2019.Congress must defend a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her reproductive health care and direct her own life.Anything short of that is just plain wrong and a harmful step
Bold North winter, where the kids are ecstatic, and the parents are counting the days. Let it snow!
A Minnesotan says he’s gone w/o insulin to treat his Type 1 diabetes 9 or 10 times bc he couldn’t afford it. “Now I know that people have died from this,” he says. Stories like this are exactly why I'm working to tackle sky-high Rx costs. We must do
Minnesotan Alan Page’s impact on our state, nation the lives of young ppl is immeasurable. The NFL Hall of Famer former MN Supreme Court Justice’s @PageEdFdn has given 10K college scholarships to ppl of color. This #BlackHistoryMonth all yr long) I’m grateful for his work.
There isn’t billions of $$$ tucked behind couch cushions in the federal government waiting to be spent. The President needs to spend more time reading the Constitution and less time on attempts at a power grab. �
Contractors have been left out in the cold, with no back pay. It's fundamentally wrong that my bipartisan bill to make them whole isn’t in the budget agreement. But I’m going to keep fighting for these workers. Thanks for discussing this important issue with me, @Morning_Joe.
RT @nowthisnews: .@SenTinaSmith and Sen. @ChrisVanHollen are not going to let federal contract workers get screwed over by Trump again
Standing in solidarity with all who marched for justice for missing and murdered indigenous women today. An alarming # of Native people endure violence in their lifetime. We must be 100% committed to addressing this problem.
Insulin has been around for almost 100 years. Yet the price has almost DOUBLED in recent years, jeopardizing many Americans' financial security and even forcing some to ration their medicine. That can be deadly. I'm working to get a grip on this problem.
1 year ago our hearts broke for the 17 people killed in the Parkland shooting. Their lives—along with their futures, hopes, dreams—unjustly stolen. And yet many in Congress refuse to act. We must do everything we can to prevent mass shootings. #ParklandStrong
My bill to secure #BackPayNOW for fed contractor workers has bipartisan support should've been in the final budget deal. I’m taking to the Senator floor to say I’m not done fighting to make this right I’ll keep on working to get it done. Watch LIVE:
This will happen to many Liberians on 3/31. I told Liberian DED holders—incl. some who live in MN—that I’m urging Trump to extend their protections. And we should take the next step and make sure they have opportunity to become citizens. Will you join me in fighting for this?
What if your neighbor of 20 yrs was forced back to a country they don’t even know? What if the person who cares for your parent in a nursing home doesn’t come to work? All bc Trump refuses to extend humanitarian protections that have allowed Liberians to legally live in the U.S.
Say it with me now: Getting back pay for federal contractor employees in the funding bill should be bipartisan, just like my bill. RETWEET if you agree.
To correct 2 big inaccuracies:1) Our bill uses a process that has been used 1000s of times to pay contractors. It’s not new argument that it'd be $$$ to implement is bogus.2) We've been working on this for weeks—idea that we brought this to the table too late is just false.
A deal to keep gov’t open is almost done. One of the last issues on the table: back pay for contractors (like custodians security guards). 800k federal workers got backpay. This is no different. We only have a few hours. Make your voices heard so we can get this done.
I feel a strong responsibility to lift up the voices of ALL sovereign tribal nations in the U.S. Thank you @NCAI1944 for inviting me to speak. I am honored and will stand shoulder to shoulder with tribal leaders as we tackle challenges facing Native communities. #ECWS19
Imagine a mom driving 100+ miles to deliver her baby. Sounds like a nightmare. But a Grand Marais mom had to do just that. Many other MNs living in rural areas face barriers that limit access to quality, affordable health care, too. So I’m working to ↑ access to rural health.
There's so much interesting history at the African American Historical Museum in Mpls that I bet a lot of folks don’t know. It’s an incredible asset highlighting achievements, contributions experiences of African Americans in MN. Check it out this #BlackHistoryMonth yr round.
Without a stable, safe place to call home, it’s hard to get your life on track. Solace Housing knows this—its “housing first” model helps ppl who’ve been in the criminal justice system w/ affordable housing as they reintegrate into society to ↓ recidivism. Check out @keyc clip:
“The loon could retreat into Canada, leaving Minnesota for good by 2080, if climate change continues.” What is MN without its beloved state bird?! What’s more, changing weather patterns will hurt #MNAg. Congress should take up my bipartisan bill to ↓ emissions from fossil fuels.
Big pharma companies are too concerned about profits. That’s hurting people like April, a Minnesotan struggling to afford her insulin. I'm working to take on big pharma and lower the cost of Rx drugs—including insulin.
You know that polar vortex Minnesota just experienced? Extreme weather like that is often because of climate change. Glad @gustavus is taking a leading role in environmental sustainability and tackling climate change. We need to act now to save our planet.
It's 100% wrong and inexcusable for employers to traffic workers and violate safety and wage laws. I’m pressing the Department of Labor to fulfill its obligations to protect Minnesota workers and fully enforce workers’ rights.
Exciting news: another Republican Senator, @LisaMurkowski, has signed on to my bill to secure back pay for low- and mid- level income federal contract employees. Thanks Lisa. This is an issue of economic fairness that both sides of the aisle should support get signed into law.
Women should have the power freedom to live the lives they want to lead make decisions for themselves. women don’t need the government looking over their shoulder in the examination room, telling them what they can can’t do with their own bodies.Retweet if you agree.
2018 was one of the HOTTEST YEARS ON RECORD climate change will keep threatening our economy future if we don’t find ways to ↓ our nation’s carbon footprint. So I’ve introduced a bipartisan bill with @SenJohnHoeven to ↓ emissions from fossil fuels—an important step forward.
It's simple: the president must extend DED for Liberians, who have legally lived in the US for 20+ yrs. I urge the Pres. to recognize this moral responsibility then take the next step make sure these Minnesotans have the opportunity to become citizens.
Listening to Hearts by Marty Balin, it's -3 outside, driving across the Mississippi River in St. Paul. It's good to be home.
Update on my work as a member of @SenateAgDems: still serving on the Rural Development Energy Subcommittee. I'm also going to be able to zero-in on important issues as new member of Commodities, Risk Management Trade; Livestock, Marketing Ag Security Subcommittees. #MNAg
Minnesotans are among the toughest when it comes to braving winter weather, and it looks like we have some tough squirrels too. Stay safe out there and bundle up.
Don’t forget: some kids are STILL separated from their families bc of Trump’s zero tolerance policy. The House held a powerful hearing on this today. I’m pushing Senate to do the same so we can understand the negative health impacts–like traumatic stress.
Here’s the deal: generic drugs are often a more affordable option BUT pharma companies unfairly block them from the market to make $$$ on their brand-name versions. I’ve teamed up with @SenatorLeahy and others on a bill fix this.
"We’re basically doing the same jobs they’re doing... What is the difference here? We continue to work hard in our everyday lives.” He hit the nail on the head. Federal contract workers deserve #BackPayNOW.
I’ll be voting no on William Barr’s nomination to be U.S. Attorney General. Here’s why:�
You may know this guy as Captain America or Johnny Storm. I decided to just call him Chris. Today, @ChrisEvans and I talked about issues that are important to our government, Minnesotans, and all Americans.

The Senate passed a bill to provide 800K federal workers with back pay. Not a single Senator objected. We should do the same for federal contractor employees, who work side by side with them. Taking to the Senate floor to push for #BackPayNOW. WATCH LIVE:
When there's opportunity to make communities more inclusive, strengthen transparency make sure banks lenders are playing by the rules, we should take it. Proud to support @SenCortezMasto's bill to deter discrimination boost fairness transparency in mortgage lending.
FYI: This afternoon at approx 3:30 PM CT/4:30 PM ET I’m taking to the Senate floor with several of my colleagues to push for our bipartisan bill to secure back pay for federal contract employees. #BackPayNOW WATCH LIVE:
"There shouldn’t be anything partisan about this — it is a simple question of common sense and fairness." I penned an op-ed with @RepPressley about our legislation to secure back pay for low- and mid-income federal contract workers. Read here:
It’s an absolute honor to have @LtGovFlanagan here in Washington as my #SOTU guest. She inspires me and so many across the state. Together, we are all #OneMinnesota.
Taking in the view from the Speaker’s Balcony. I mean *Madame* Speaker’s Balcony. So glad to have Minnesota’s @LtGovFlanagan with me here in Washington.
Together we can help rural Minnesota overcome the unique challenges it faces when it comes to access to quality, affordable health care to help folks live healthy, stable, safe lives. Today I presented a few ideas to @ruralhealth we ought to take up:
Could've spent the entire day talking to these MN tribal college students. So inspired by their goals work. Tribal colleges provide education workforce training to rural students while also serving as Native cultural community centers. 100% committed to supporting them.

Trump Admin forcibly separated children from their parents, and now claims that reuniting families is too hard. If the government took my children away from me, no effort would be too much to get them back. These families are the same as all our families.
I sat down w @ChrisVanHollen to discuss our bill to secure back pay for low- mid- income fed contract workers. It's gaining support every day. If you think it’s wrong that people are getting a pay cut bc of a shutdown fight that had nothing to do w/ them, make your voice heard.
Thanks @DaniDougPost for covering this important topic. Teachers shouldn’t unfairly have their grants convert to loans because of minor paperwork errors. If you think you've been wronged, please read this.
Check out the impressive guests (including who I’m bringing, @LtGovFlanagan) who are attending tomorrow’s State of The
"This is an important opportunity for Republicans and Democrats to join in to do something good. If you think it’s wrong that hardworking people got a pay cut because of a shutdown that had nothing to do with them, then it’s time to make your voice heard.”
Racism is when you cannot see the basic humanity of people who are different from you. I cannot imagine this administration arguing that it would be too much of a burden to reunite white children who they forcibly took away from their parents.
So glad to share that my bill to secure back pay for federal contract workers after the shutdown now has bipartisan support. Thank you @SenatorCollins. I hope more of our Republican colleagues will follow your lead so that we can come together and fix this.
Today, consumer advocates, tech companies, and states see their challenge against @AjitPaiFCC’s #netneutrality repeal get its day in court. Proud to have joined 103 Congressional lawmakers in filing amicus brief in support of free and open internet. I’ll keep fighting.
There are many black Minnesotans who are truly redefining representation right now. They’re doers, they’re change makers, they’re making history. So each week this #BlackHistoryMonth, I’m going to highlight black MNs who are part of this movement. Join me in celebrating them.
Lila, a 71-year old great-grandmother who is featured in this video, went 5 weeks with no pay because of Trump’s shutdown. She has worked as a janitor for 21 years, and deserves #BackPayNOW.
I want to create economic opportunity for ALL of MN that includes tribal lands. So yesterday I helped intro a bill to boost biz development in Native communities that'll help folks access workspaces, funding, education mentorship opportunities. A step in the right direction.
️️️ Happy to report that my #BackpayNOW bill has the support of 39 Senators (40 counting me!) and from over 50 of my colleagues on the House side. Really hoping this bill gets bipartisan support.
Honored MN’s @LtGovFlanagan has agreed to be my guest at the #SOTU. I’m grateful to Peggy for her commitment to work for people across Minnesota in the spirit of #OneMinnesota. Peggy leads with compassion determination is a source of inspiration for me many across the U.S.
An alarming number of Native women and men endure violence in their lifetimes. So today I introduced a bill to help tribes seek and get justice for their members, and for survivors. I urge Congress to pass it into law. It’s what’s just and right.
Update: I helped re-intro the Paycheck Fairness Act, which gets right to the root of working towards full equity by strengthening equal pay laws and closing loopholes so women can challenge pay discrimination and hold employers accountable. I'm here for women and families.
Federal contract workers have to put food on the table pay bills, just like everyone else. But they’re not getting back pay after the shutdown haven’t received it after previous ones. In a few min I’ll be on @CBSNLive explaining how I’m working to right that wrong. Tune in.
@SenWarren @RepPressley Thanks, Elizabeth, for supporting my bill and standing up for federal contract employees. These Americans work shoulder to shoulder with federal employees and deserve #BackPayNOW.
EVEN ANTIFREEZE IS
Congress must take up pass my bill to secure back pay for federal contractors like janitors, cafeteria workers security guards who haven't been made whole post shutdown. Glad that @StarTribune @washingtonpost ed boards agree.
Making it easier for people to vote is not a power grab, it is our democracy. Democracy. More voters voting = democracy.
Grateful for all public safety workers and first responders making sure Minnesotans stay safe during this cold snap, including @StPaulFireDept and @sppdmn, who helped battle a house fire while facing -50F below wind chills around 5 a.m. this morning.
� @RepPressley I took a minute to break down why we need to secure back pay for federal contract workers. These people work shoulder to shoulder w/ federal employees to make the govt work for all of us but aren’t getting back pay after the shutdown. Time to right that wrong.
Good to see you @ASlavitt. I’d say you lucked out by scheduling your visit to Washington during the polar vortex.
@maziehirono Thanks for joining me yesterday, Mazie. Grateful for your commitment to help secure #BackPayNOW for low- and mid-wage federal contractor employees.
@SenBlumenthal Completely agree. Federal contractor employees shouldn’t have to bear the brunt of being Trump’s bargaining chips. Thanks for supporting my bill to help secure #BackPayNOW.
Working on it, @maddow. But I’m feeling optimistic because there are a handful of Republicans over in the House who just started working on this issue. Hopefully Republican Senators follow suit soon.
“He [Trump] held us hostage for 35 days. I feel, personally, now he’s still holding me hostage… I had to go into my life insurance while I was out.” We need to secure #BackPayNow for Lila and thousands of other low- and mid- income federal contractor employees.
@32BJSEIU @RepPressley @EleanorNorton @ChrisVanHollen @EdMarkey @SenBlumenthal @maziehirono @amyklobuchar And thank you, @32BJSEIU, for joining me yesterday. Your voice matters and I’m not giving up this fight.
@figue32bj @TinaSmithMN And thank you, Hector, as well as everyone from @32BJSEIU, for joining me and my colleagues yesterday.
But we’re working to change that @maddow.
Women � deserve � equal � pay � for � equal � work. The #LillyLedbetterFairPayAct, signed into law 10 year ago today, was a key step in fighting the #incomegap but there’s more work we must do to close the gap—particularly for women of color. I'm ready to get to work.
@SenatorBaldwin Something Minnesota and Wisconsin can agree on: federal contractors have bills to pay, just like everyone else, and deserve their paychecks.
@ChrisMurphyCT Thanks for being a strong champion for workers, Chris. This is an important issue of economic fairness, dignity, and justice.

A coalition of more than a dozen dems and @32BJSEIU are joining me, @RepPressley and @EleanorNorton to secure #BackPayNOW for federal contract workers hurt by Trump’s shutdown. Too often these folks are invisible—we're standing up for them. Watch LIVE:
Minnesota: this record-breaking cold snap is something to take seriously. With wind chill, it looks like temps may drop as low as -50F. Please bundle up, be careful when driving, and stay warm.
When I first walked the halls of Minnesota’s state capitol, Duane Benson cheered me on, offered advice, and urged me to seek the bipartisan path that would move Minnesota forward. Wishing his family peace, and grateful that I knew Duane.
TOMORROW: @RepPressley, @EleanorNorton, @32BJSEIU, other Senate House colleagues I are gathering together to call for #BackPayNOW. It’s completely outrageous that 1000s of federal contractors aren’t getting back pay after the shutdown. I have a bill to right that wrong.
Hurricane Maria rocked Puerto Rico, leaving it w/o electricity for months. But the island has overcome great obstacles to rebuild itself I'm glad to see @UMNews working w/ PR to explore more resilient energy sources that may better withstand hurricanes.
Native communities were some of the hardest hit by Trump’s shutdown, jeopardizing the health and wellness of Native people. I helped introduce a bill to protect critical tribal services like health care and law enforcement from future budget uncertainty.
Wish this said “all members”—but instead we’re just stuck with “some.” Working to fix that. Everyone should be on-board with securing back pay for federal contract workers who aren’t receiving back pay post shutdown. #FairnessForContractors
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, #WeRemember the millions of lives lost to genocide. We remember Jewish survivors, how their lives were shaped forever by the horrific trauma that they their families endured. It’s important to fight for justice, and step in when you see injustice.
RT @MotherJones: Don't forget: Federal contract workers aren't guaranteed back pay
@TonyaJoRiley Good question Tonya. Yeah, @senatemajldr—are you and the Republicans going to support getting these workers their back pay? Asking for thousands of people.
Totally agree. I introduced a bill to right this wrong in the Senate and @RepPressley has a bill over on your side of the Capitol. Let’s right this wrong. Workers need their paychecks.
It's unfair. Contractors incl. cafeteria workers, security guards janitors. They help the government run deserve back pay like everyone else. I intro’d a bill to fix this. 27 Senate Dems support it has a House companion. Would be nice if @senatemajldr put it on the floor.
I joined @HardballChris to talk abt the shutdown, which needs to end. Today marks the 2nd missed paycheck for fed employees. Families can’t put food on the table or pay bills. Planes are delayed because of staffing issues. We're at a tipping point, Mr. President. #EndTheShutdown
Annie, a Duluth resident, landed her dream job working as a chemist at the @EPA but she’s had to file for unemployment bc of the shutdown. Fed workers fed contract workers, like Annie, do important work. We must open the government so they can get back to work get paid.
About to sit down with @HardballChris to discuss the latest shutdown news and my bill to secure back pay for federal contract workers. These Americans—janitors, cafeteria staff, security guards—aren’t getting paid and haven’t received back pay after past shutdowns. Tune in.
Met w/ Mpls Mayor @Jacob_Frey St. Paul’s @MayorCarter_. We covered the shutdown also discussed affordable housing—something I want to work on on the Senate Banking Cmte. When MNs have affordable stable homes, it's easier to land jobs, do well in school live healthy lives.
Hey @MN_Chamber, thank you for calling for an end to Trump’s shutdown. It’s a complete waste of taxpayer dollars and I've heard from Minnesotans about how it’s hurting their businesses. We need to open the government ASAP. Minnesotans are counting on
“Silence is our enemy. We need to speak up for basic American values, social justice, and equality and basic fairness, and that everybody has to have the opportunity to build the lives they want.” Thanks, @MNSpokesman, for sitting down to talk.

Today is Archie’s birthday. I first met this adorable man when he was 29; he was almost as handsome then as he is now today I love him more than I even knew what love was when we 1st met. In honor of his bday here are a few things I’ve learned about him:
Trump’s shutdown may have lasting damage to education in Minnesota. The shutdown is costing the University of Minnesota about $500K A DAY to make up for the lack of federal funding, disrupting important research. #EndTheShutdown
Federal contract employees are too often invisible. And get this—they’re not getting paid and haven’t received back pay after previous shutdowns. We ought to make sure these folks can be made whole. So I’ve introduced a bill to do just that. To me it's just a matter of fairness.
� Reminder that this means #DACA recipients can apply to renew their status for the time being. If you have any questions, feel free to call my St. Paul office at 651.221.1016. I’m here to help.
Trump’s shutdown is costing the University of Minnesota about half a million dollars a day. As time goes on the U runs out of funds, there’s going to be more gaps in research gaps in opportunities for students. Another reason why we must end this shutdown as soon as possible.
A Grand Marais mom had to drive 4 HOURS IN A SNOWSTORM to get to the nearest hospital to deliver her baby. I’m working to boost access to rural health care so all Americans, including pregnant moms, can access quality health care no matter where they live.
Today is day 32 of Trump's shutdown. THIRTY-TWO. That's not a typo. #EndTheShutdown
46 years ago today, the #RoeVsWade #SCOTUS decision affirmed women’s freedom power to live the lives they want to lead make decisions for themselves. Women don’t need the government looking over their shoulder in the examination room, telling them what they can cannot do.
Looks like #DACA will remain in place for most of 2019 but the urgency to solve this crisis remains—#SCOTUS declined to take up the case for now, but could later. Congress needs to pass the DREAM
9 yrs ago the Citizens United #SCOTUS decision struck down key limitations on election spending, opening the floodgates for the wealthiest Americans, giant corporations special interests to flood our elections w/ money to try to tip the scales. We must overturn Citizens United.
Activism is about action, not just sitting around and talking. So let’s go out and be active. #MLKDay
I’m here at #MLK Breakfast with 2,800 others, remembering that doing for others, as Dr. King said, is a call to social action.
Low- mid-income federal contract workers, like janitors, cafeteria workers security guards, aren’t getting paid during the shutdown haven't received back pay after past ones. Watch this @nowthisnews video to hear how I’m working to right that wrong:
I went to Division of Indian Work to hear about the impact Trump’s shutdown is having on Minnesota's food shelves. Commissioner Lourey told me, “There is no alternative. SNAP is the most effective food support system in the country.” We need to open the government now.
#ICYMI a bill designed to limit women's access to choice failed in the Senate last week. Glad it did. When women don't have the freedom to make their own choices about their reproductive health care, they have lost the freedom to direct their own lives.
Kids still need to eat nutritious, healthy meals during Trump's shutdown. If you're a federal worker with children, please know that you can apply for free or reduced meals. 
Confirms what so many college grads can tell you: crushing student loan debt means you have to delay or forgo major milestones—like buying a house. Student debt crisis is having a huge impact on our
The list of ways that Trump's shutdown is hurting science is so long that it’s dizzying. @USDA labs in Minnesota are closed. Databases have massive gaps. And projects that move our country's science and technology forward have halted.
When a company fakes going out of business to avoid paying their employees, it's stealing. That's what happened to @Teamsters120 members. Because they had their union to fight for them, today they got paid. When people organize for fairness and justice, they raise us all up.
Thanks @afrodeli and all those who are helping federal workers during Trump's shutdown. It's a shame that you have to do it in the first place.
A historic number of women now serve in Congress—131 in all. @nytimes photographed them all. Proud to call them my colleagues.
MN's a leader in clean energy. A man who once relied on assistance to pay for his heating bill came up w/ an idea: build solar gardens to ↓ energy costs for low-income homes. He has partnered with Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe is now bringing his idea to
Thank you Ian. These low- and mid- wage federal contractors are public servants, and expect to be treated with respect, not as pawns. Are you listening, @senatemajldr and @realDonaldTrump?
I want to read a letter to you that I received from Sara, a Minnesotan and federal employee of 17+ years, who is getting hurt by Trump’s shutdown. I am working hard to end this shutdown because I know the impact that it’s having on Minnesotans like Sara and so many others.
Fed contractor employees—janitors, cafeteria workers security guards—have bills to pay just like everyone else. But they're not being paid during the shutdown haven't received back pay in the past. It's unfair. So I intro'd a bill to right that wrong.
Listen to what Audrey, a federal contractor employee, says to me in this @KVRRTV clip. Trump’s shutdown is taking a very serious toll on the welfare of Americans. #EndTheShutdown
Read this story and be angry, and then speak out. It is immoral to rip these immigrant children away from their parents.
Too often mid-income fed contract workers are invisible. These are ppl who provide security or clean office spaces. And get this: many aren’t getting paid during the shutdown AND haven't received back pay after past ones. I intro'd a bill to fix

Trump’s shutdown is imposing a massive burden on communities to speed up getting SNAP funds to Americans before a Jan 21 deadline. People who sign up after that may not get food support March funding is in limbo. Basic human needs like food should NOT be jeopardized like this.
A Minnesotan w/ cancer who's affected by the shutdown wrote me, “Instead of worrying abt getting me healthy, we have been wracked w/ thoughts of ‘What if this continues we can’t pay our mortgage?’ ‘How will we pay for my medical bills in the immediate future?'" #EndTheShutdown
RT @FitzFox5DC: #HappeningNow @Fox5DC: Maryland Senator @ChrisVanHollen and Minnesota Senator @TinaSmithMN are holding a roundtable in the…
.@SenatorCardin, @ChrisVanHollen and I are sitting down with federal service contractors who work as security guards and janitorial staff to hear how Trump's shutdown is hurting them. Join me in listening to their shutdown stories live:  #EndTheShutdown
mid-wage fed contract employees are being hit hard by Trump's shutdown. They’re not getting paid haven’t received back pay after previous shutdowns. I'm intro'ing a bill to right that wrong. These workers shouldn’t have to bear the brunt of being Trump’s bargaining chips.
Congrats on the new job, Sam. Thanks for your work to keep Minnesotans up to date on all things Washington. And thanks for being the emcee and breaking a tie at my first Minnesota Congressional Hotdish Competition.
#ICYMI: Trump Administration finally listened to warnings of health issues at Tornillo detention facility and removed all children from the site. I visited Tornillo last month and what I saw goes against our values.
The human toll of Trump’s shutdown is very real. Derek, a Farmington air traffic controller, wrote me, “It is quite ridiculous that an air traffic controller would be affected by political games. Take us off the bargaining table.” Couldn’t agree more. #EndTheShutdown
US AG nominee William Barr has an alarming record of abusing civil rights. And if confirmed, he'll have great power to oversee important issues including voting rights and criminal justice reform. Oh, and the Mueller investigation. Watch his hearing today. It matters.
