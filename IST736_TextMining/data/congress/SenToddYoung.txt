With the multitude of diseases and disorders effecting blood and blood related systems, I appreciated speaking with members of @ASH_hematology  on how robust NIH funding can help further research into these conditions.
20 veterans die each day due to suicide. This national tragedy demands all of our attention. This week, @POTUS signed an executive order to provide #veterans with the help they deserve.
Today I visited Corteva to learn about how this major agriscience company is advancing Indiana’s agriculture.
We must take care of those who have sacrificed so much for our nation. I was honored to meet with @PVA1946 about ensuring our veterans, especially those with spinal cord injury and dysfunction, receive quality care.
The economy continues to grow. I visited with some of the 1,100+ employees at the Nike XPO facility in Lebanon.
With the rapid growth of #Indiana air travel, it was a pleasure meeting with Nate Hahn and Scott Hinderman the Executive Directors of @FlyEVV and @FlyFWA airports to touch base on issues important to Hoosier airports.
Hoosiers know Indiana as the Crossroads of America thanks to our strong infrastructure network and the many logistics providers that call Indiana home. The bipartisan #DRIVESafeAct is a safe way create more job opportunities while ensuring young truckers receive proper training.
Lindsay Charles with Mended Hearts in Evansville visited my office this week for a moving meeting. We discussed her son Burley- who was born with Congenital Heart Defects- and legislation like the Heart Futures Reauthorization Act that can help save
Did you know that The Indiana Osteopathic Association is one of the oldest state osteopathic associations in the nation? Thank you to the members of the @IndianaOsteo who came out to visit me this week.
This follows a hearing in the Small Business Committee yesterday where I had the opportunity to discuss non-compete agreements with expert witnesses. Video here:

Thank you @CWS_global for helping Hoosiers fight global hunger, poverty and displacement since 1949. It was a pleasure meeting with Rev. John McCullough to discuss their efforts in promoting the welfare of Hoosiers.
The @SenateYouth Program selects students with a strong interest in public service to receive a scholarship travel to DC for Washington Week. I’m proud of Ishaan from @HSEPrincipal and William from @MyZvilleSchools for their hard work and service. #USSYP
My most important responsibility is listening to Hoosiers and making sure your voices are heard in Washington. That’s why I look forward to my #HoosierHuddle coffees every week. Check out some highlights from this morning's huddle →
Instead of promoting job-killing legislation, we should be promoting proposals like the #USEItAct. This bipartisan bill would promote carbon capture research and development. This is an area of common ground for Republicans and Democrats.
Over the next decade, this so-called “deal” would cost up to $65,000 per American household per year. That’s 47 percent more than the median Hoosier household income.
Indiana is home to a high-skilled Hoosier workforce, world-class infrastructure network, and low energy costs. But the #GreenNewDeal would crush Indiana’s affordable energy prices – forcing the cost of doing business to skyrocket for Hoosier manufacturers and farmers.
The #GreenNewDeal is an unaffordable, unattainable, and unrealistic proposal. It’s bad news for all Americans, especially for Indiana as the most manufacturing intensive state in the country.
I’m heading to the @SenateFloor shortly to share why the #GreenNewDeal is a bad deal for Hoosiers. Watch my speech live here:
Congress has failed to perform its Constitutionally mandated oversight role and our bill aims to change that.  
Today, I introduced a bill with @timkaine to formally end the outdated authorizations for the Gulf Iraq wars. As a young high school student, I enlisted in the Navy mere weeks before the Gulf War began. Now, 28 years later, those war authorities are still active and in law.
I always enjoy starting my day off meeting with Hoosiers during my weekly #HoosierHuddle. This week, I had the opportunity to speak to: @JDRF, @ocrahope, @LupusOrg, @TouretteAssn, and several other organizations. Come visit me next week:
Helping Hoosiers #DRIVESafe, major wins for Indiana lands, and my visit to a fourth-generation family farm – All these #HoosierHighlights and more in this week’s newsletter:
The words unaffordable, unattainable, and unrealistic come to mind when I think of this #GreenNewDeal.
Indianapolis’ @rtv6 reported on my #DRIVESafeAct in its Hiring Hoosiers segment:
Indiana public lands have had three big wins recently. Read about them in my op-ed for @NWI:
Had a full house at my #HoosierHuddles this week. We had people visiting from: Muncie, Bloomington, Munster, Angola, Indianapolis, and several other cities across the state.
Veterans suicide rates are too high. I met with Dennis Wimer, the incoming Director of @InVetAffairs, to discuss how to best #bethere for Hoosier veterans. Including improved access to healthcare, reducing homelessness, and better transition support for our veterans.
You’d be hard-pressed to think of a more harmful “deal” for Hoosiers than the #GreenNewDeal.
This past week, I spoke about the importance of reduced regulatory burdens to help provide Hoosiers affordable, reliable energy.
Spoke w/ farmers in Greenfield today during a roundtable w/ @INFarmBureau at @TuttleOrchards. The agriculture industry is the backbone of Indiana’s economy, so it’s critical to hear from farmers like the Roneys about the issues impacting Hoosier farms.
Today in Anderson: I joined @intrucking and @CarterExpress to highlight the #DRIVESafeAct. We are working to address the driver shortage, while providing career opportunities for young Hoosiers and improving safety on the roads.
Takeaway from this week’s @SenateCommerce hearing: we must create strong consumer privacy protections that also allow small businesses to grow and thrive in the U.S.

Big news for Hoosiers this week. Indiana officially has its first National Park @POTUS signed my bills for @NationalFFA and housing reform into law. Take a look at my #HoosierHighlights newsletter to learn more →
I’ll also be voting tonight for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which bans the horrific act of infanticide by ensuring that babies who survive attempted abortions have the chance at life that they deserve. More here: 
As cruel abortion practices are being pushed in states like New York and Virginia, I am fighting to protect innocent life. I’m glad @HHSGov issued new regulations to ensure family planning funds are not being used to subsidize abortion procedures.
I met with workers at the Rolls Royce plant in Indy this morning. Excited for the company’s future in Indianapolis.
#ICYMI: @FOX59 reports on one Jeffersonville family’s experience with the organ donation system and the need to shine some light on what’s going on behind the scenes.

The @SpecialOlympics inspire and benefit people worldwide with their mission of acceptance for all. Thanks to the Indiana advocates with Special Olympics International who stopped by my office to share the great work they do.

The Senate just passed a suite of land bills that contains my legislation to extend the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail from St. Louis, Missouri to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, including all of Indiana’s southern border.

The President has not forgotten the sacrifices of people like Alec Terwiske. That is something that ought to be unifying. @OutnumberedOT
About to go live on @FoxNews with @HARRISFAULKNER. We’ll be talking about the #SOTU and border security. Tune in now.

My reaction to @POTUS’ #SOTU ️
85 federal judges confirmed since @POTUS came into office. A booming economy. Nearly 45,000 Indiana jobs created on the back end of #taxreform. These are some of the things I predict we’ll hear about in tonight’s #SOTU.

Thanks for joining @SenatorBraun. Looking forward to more #HoosierHuddles to come.
I am cosponsoring a bill to permanently repeal the death tax. Death should not be a taxable event Hoosiers should not be forced to sell a family farm or transfer ownership of a small business because of the loss of a family member.
Hoosier students with @Simon_Youth Academies are getting a first-hand look at our government in action and learning how to become active citizens. Glad I could spend some time visiting with them during their visit to Washington with @CloseUp_DC.
Hoosiers, stay safe during today’s extreme cold and follow @NWSIndianapolis for more updates.
The continued detention of @Reuters journalists Wa Lone Kyaw Soe Oo in Burma only underscores the Burmese military’s efforts to conceal the atrocities it has committed. I helped introduce a new bipartisan resolution calling for the journalists' release.
My first @SenateFinance hearing is today. I’m really excited to start my work on this committee to address some of our nation’s most pressing issues. This morning we examine prescription drug pricing as it impacts countless Hoosiers.

Extending the Lewis and Clark trail across Indiana will honor the trail’s important legacy, and boost tourism for our state. A win-win.
Ahead of the @March_for_Life tomorrow, I spoke on the Senate floor in support of pro-life policies. We are divided on so many issues today, but protecting the lives of unborn children should not be one of those issues. #whywemarch
Please join me in saying a prayer today for the U.S. service members killed in Syria. These American heroes made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our nation and my heart goes out to their loved ones.

I sat down with Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson today to discuss the housing affordability crisis in Indiana and the steps forward – Including my housing affordability task force bill and the @leagueofcities National Task Force on Housing.
Today I joined a group of Senators to reintroduce the #REINSAct. This common-sense legislation works to rein in costly, job-killing regulations for hardworking Americans.
Very proud of Aaryan Morrison from Kokomo who was named Distinguished Young Woman of America for 2018.
Americans who believe in the sanctity of life should not subsidize abortion services. I joined 13 Senate colleagues encouraging HHS to pass a rule banning such subsidies.
A great group of @NDLaw students stopped by my office today to say hello. Enjoyed hearing about their participation in the Galilee program, which enables students to see how lawyers and judges are addressing issues of poverty and social justice.

After more than 30 years of our nation’s organ donation system operating in darkness, it’s time to get a look behind the curtain. That’s why I plan to introduce legislation in the next Congress to create greater transparency, oversight, and accountability.
New reports from @washingtonpost today further underscore flaws in our organ donation system. More than 10,000 people die annually waiting on an organ or become too sick to receive a transplant in Indiana more than 1,300 Hoosiers are currently in need of a transplant.
The House just passed my bill with @SenatorDubrin to increase research funding for congenital heart defects. Encouraging news for the millions of survivors living with this disease.

#ICYMI: @WSBT shares my announcement on big investments coming to Indiana roads.
Some big news in Indiana this week -- $40 million for infrastructure upgrades, 39 young Hoosiers nominated for service academies more in my #HoosierHighlights newsletter:
