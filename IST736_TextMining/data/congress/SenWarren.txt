The #ForThePeople Act is a strong first step toward cleaning up Washington corruption. I’m fighting to get this bill a vote on the Senate floor – and I’ll keep fighting for my Anti-Corruption Act for more big structural changes to #EndCorruptionNow strengthen our democracy.
I’m very grateful that we have a strong partner in the House to lead these big fights to #EndCorruptionNow – and win them. @RepJayapal works her heart out every day to make this government work #ForThePeople, not the wealthy well-connected.
One more thing: We shouldn’t have to beg candidates to let people see their financial interests. @RepJayapal led the charge to require presidential candidates to release years of tax returns for themselves AND their business empires. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople
In case you haven’t noticed, a zillion Trump officials have had to lawyer up for breaking the rules. The House passed our plan to make sure that government officials who establish legal expense funds can’t secretly beg powerful interests for money. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople
The House passed our provision to require ALL White House staff advisors, paid or unpaid, to follow basic ethics rules. That includes, for example, senior advisor family members who don't divest their holdings hand out WH visits to investors. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople
No more selling out to foreign governments that abuse human rights undermine our national security. @RepJayapal made sure the House bill included our ban on Washington lobbyists from getting paid big bucks to lobby for foreign governments. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople
Incoming administrations should work for the people, not lobbyists industry insiders. The House passed our plan to force people who work on presidential transition teams to follow ethics rules like every other official. #EndCorruptionNow #ForThePeople
.@RepJayapal I have the most ambitious anti-corruption legislation since Watergate to #EndCorruptionNow. This week, we got terrific news: with @RepJayapal's hard work persistence, the House included — passed — some key parts of it in the historic #ForThePeople Act:
People all across this country are being crushed by student loan debt. That’s why I’m so glad @EricLesser is leading the fight to help student borrowers in Massachusetts.
Bill Shine’s resignation removes 1 ethics problem at the most ethically bankrupt @WhiteHouse in history. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would prevent White House staffers from getting paid off by their ex-employers when they're supposed to be working for the American people.

To all the women who have been told “no” over and over again and continue to persist: keep it up. You make us stronger. #InternationalWomensDay
Some military families have been living in toxic homes while the private companies that oversee them make a guaranteed profit. I’m working on a new bill to fix that broken system. In the meantime, @DeptofDefense needs to start enforcing the rules that are already on the books.
Are they joking? @Equifax didn’t take data security seriously because it had no financial incentive to do so. That’s why we need my bill with @MarkWarner to impose automatic fines for data breaches at companies like Equifax stop this from happening
The average student in Massachusetts graduates with $32,065 in student loans. Instead of jump-starting their lives and careers, they’re being weighed down by debt. I’m co-sponsoring @SenBrianSchatz’s #DebtFreeCollege bill to make sure every student can build an economic future.
DHS @SecNielsen testified today that @CBP “never purposely put a child in a cage." False.I went to the processing center in McAllen, TX. I saw cages of people with my own eyes. Men, women, and children treated like animals. We must hold the Trump Admin accountable.
Chad Readler led efforts to let giant insurance companies discriminate against Americans with pre-existing conditions. A vote to confirm him as a federal appeals court judge is a stamp of approval to rip health care away from millions of Americans.
The internet doesn’t belong to a few giant companies – it belongs to all of us. Rather than tilting the playing field toward corporate interests, I'm joining @SenMarkey and @SenateDems to introduce a bill that restores #NetNeutrality and keeps the internet free and open for all.
Climate change is a threat to our national security. Full stop.
My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would require most @WhiteHouse employees (including Bill Shine) to recuse themselves from all issues that might financially benefit a former employer or client. Our government should work for everyone, not just @realDonaldTrump's inner circle.
It's no wonder @FoxNews is an echo chamber for the Trump Admin's fear-mongering. Trump's Deputy Chief of Staff is still cashing checks from Fox, his ex employer. My office requested info on Bill Shine's possible ethics violations in December. Still
The American people deserve better than an administration that appears to be for sale to companies eager to line the President’s pockets.
T-Mobile CEO @JohnLegere publicly insulted @realDonaldTrump about poor service at his hotels. But now that @TMobile has a $26 billion merger with @Sprint pending Trump Admin approval, he's happy to spend $195,000 at Trump’s DC hotel. Sound shady? It is.
The @DeptofDefense runs the largest employer-sponsored child care program in the country, caring for over 200,000 kids. It’s the kind of high-quality, affordable child care that should be in every family’s reach – and it’s the model for my #UniversalChildCare plan.
Massachusetts has lost one of its greatest champions with the passing of Rob Restuccia. His legacy will live on in our fight to guarantee health care to every American. My heart goes out to his friends, family, and everyone at @HealthPolicyHub.
It's wrong for states to punish people struggling to pay off student loans by taking away their drivers or professional licenses. That's why @SenRubioPress and I reintroduced legislation to allow borrowers to keep working and build better financial
I’m proud to serve with (and be a part of) a record-breaking number of women in the 116th Congress. As we kick off #WomensHistoryMonth, it’s a reminder of how far we’ve come, and how far we still have left to go.
The opioid epidemic is a public health crisis – we have to treat it like one. Some towns are making real progress with state and federal grants, but they need more resources. My plan, the #CAREact, would spend $100B on treatment, recovery, and research.
Jane Bolin, the first Black woman in US history to become a judge, said that achieving equality for Black women means fighting "every inch of the way.” As the struggle for equality continues, we follow her courageous example. #BlackHistoryMonth
I didn't think things could get any worse at the @EPA after Scott Pruitt. But I was wrong. The Senate just confirmed Andrew Wheeler – an ex-lobbyist who worked to roll back critical environmental regulations – to run the agency. Our kids will pay the
As Acting @Interior Secretary, David Bernhardt is supposed to protect America’s public lands. Instead, the ex-lobbyist appears to be protecting the interests of his former clients. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would keep him out of the Dept.

It’s the @federalreserve's job to vet mergers like the one between @Suntrust and @BBT that would create another Too Big To Fail Bank. But in the last decade the Fed hasn’t denied a single application. Today, I told Chairman Powell why that has to change:
Bayard Rustin was a leading organizer of the 1963 March on Washington. Openly gay, he never achieved the widespread recognition he deserved. Listen to him explain why he fought so hard for the rights of marginalized communities. #BlackHistoryMonth
Our servicemembers their families shouldn't have to live in toxic homes while the private companies that oversee them make a guaranteed profit. Military families sacrifice for our country every day. We owe it to them to protect their health well-being.
Republican politicians just tried (and failed) again to score political points at the expense of women. Enough. Women and their doctors should decide what’s best for their health – not the @SenateGOP.
Eric Miller has spent his career working to gut tribal sovereignty, but Trump nominated him to sit on the appeals court with jurisdiction over 75% of federally recognized tribes. Confirming him would threaten tribal rights – so I'll be voting no today.

Massachusetts families pay an eye-popping $20,000 a year for infant child care – that’s more than in-state college tuition. My plan for #UniversalChildCare would make child care free for tens of thousands of MA families, millions more across the country.
Saudi Arabia brutally murdered a journalist in its own consulate and bombed Yemeni civilians with US-armed warplanes. And if that wasn’t bad enough, it also may have transferred US weapons to violent extremists.It's time to start holding Saudi Arabia accountable.

Trump's wall is a #FakeNationalEmergency – but natural disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, and floods are real. My bill would prevent @realDonaldTrump from diverting disaster recovery funds to pay for his border wall. 
Whether you have kids, grandkids, or no kids at all – America's children are our country's future. That means we have an interest, and a responsibility, to invest in them. Let’s start by making #UniversalChildCare a reality.
My #UltraMillionaireTax on America’s wealthiest families could fund #UniversalChildCare, giving millions of kids a leg up. And by offering parents more options to balance work and family, we could also help boost our economy.
In many states, child care is more expensive than in-state college tuition. Under my plan for #UniversalChildCare, child care would be free for nearly 9 million kids. And no family would pay more than 7% of their income for child care.
My plan for #UniversalChildCare would build off the success of Head Start to create a network of high-quality child care options. Federal funding would guarantee every family has access to high-quality, affordable care for kids from birth to kindergarten.
When my kids were little, I struggled to find good, reliable, and affordable child care. It felt like an impossible task then – and it still is for many families. That’s why I’m proposing a new plan for #UniversalChildCare.
On this #PresidentsDay, celebrating the groundbreaking achievements of this man, who is living proof that no dream is too big.
Our military families deserve safe, clean housing. So why are some living with mice, mold, or lead paint? Because the private companies that maintain many of their homes are skimping, but still padding their pockets with profits. It’s unacceptable.
Mexico wouldn't pay for @realDonaldTrump's wall. Congress wouldn't fully fund it. So now he's throwing a temper tantrum and declaring a "national emergency." My new bill would stop him from using disaster recovery funds for his pet project.
A year after the Parkland Shooting, Congress still hasn’t passed strong legislation to address gun violence. But I’m going to keep fighting – along with the MSD survivors and students across the country who are working to #EndGunViolence. Together, we will make change.
Thousands of US citizens in Puerto Rico died during Hurricane Maria and its aftermath. Brock Long oversaw the Trump Administration's botched disaster response, and he has enabled the Administration's negligence regarding Puerto Rico. His resignation was long overdue.
The House just voted to end US military support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen. I’m proud to be an early co-sponsor of the companion bill in the Senate, and I urge @SenateMajLdr McConnell to bring it to a vote. We cannot continue to be complicit in the deaths of civilians.

You bet I do.
.@realDonaldTrump wants 2 things from his Attorney General: loyalty to Trump, and a willingness to put the interests of the powerful few ahead of everyone else.William Barr checks both those boxes. And that’s exactly why I’ll be voting no.
Mary Hamilton successfully fought a court system that denied Black Americans the dignity of being called Mr. or Miss. Her heroic actions advanced equality for all Americans. #BlackHistoryMonth
It’s too easy for the wealthy well-connected to rig the system during presidential transitions. I have a bill with @SenatorCarper @RepCummings to ensure transition teams operate for the American people—not special interests.
A bank teller who takes a few 20s from the bank is looking at serious jail time. But the @WellsFargo CEO can cheat millions of Americans and walk away. That’s a rigged system - and it needs to change.
Ready.
Gigantic banks wrecked our economy, but the Fed told me they are rubber-stamping nearly every proposed bank merger. @SunTrust and @BBT are probably next. We can’t let banks become too big to fail again: American families will suffer.
My heart goes out to @RepDebDingell, and their entire family.
Kathy Kraninger gutted the @CFPB rule that would stop payday lenders from trapping borrowers in cycles of debt. Siding with payday lenders over consumers is shameful -  Kraninger needs to withdraw this proposal immediately.
If we want to live in a world with clean air and water, we have to take real action to combat climate change now. I'm proud to join @RepAOC and @SenMarkey on a #GreenNewDeal resolution to fight for our planet and our kids’ futures.
We have data to determine if Saudi jets killed Yemeni civilians with our support. We need to face the ugly truth - by continuing to enable Saudi Arabia, America is complicit in the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. We must end our support for this war now.
When I asked the Pentagon last year if they tracked US fuel bombs used in Saudi airstrikes that killed civilians in Yemen, they said no. This time, the Pentagon admitted there’s an entire database of that info and @DeptofDefense has access to it.

Sajid Shahriar is my guest for tonight's #SOTU. He's a federal worker and @AFGENational rep who was affected by the shutdown. He wants to make sure we avoid another one and keep our government open.
David Bernhardt is an ex-Big Oil lobbyist who's worked to pollute our environment for profit. He’s a walking conflict of interest who shouldn’t even be allowed through the front door of the @Interior Dept. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow would keep him out.
Glad to announce Sajid Shahriar will be my #SOTU guest. He's a MA federal worker and union leader who went 35 days without a paycheck during the #TrumpShutdown. Government workers like Sajid shouldn't be used as bargaining chips. They deserve better.
It’s long past time to bring our troops home from Afghanistan. And when they return, we need to make sure they get the health care, GI benefits, and other support they've earned.
We won this fight, but we know @BetsyDeVosED and her cronies at @usedgov aren’t looking out for students. We’ve got to stay watchful and keep her accountable. Follow our oversight work at #DeVosWatch.
A piece of good news for students, teachers, and student loan borrowers. This week, I called out @realDonaldTrump for abruptly replacing the top government watchdog in charge of holding @BetsyDeVosEd accountable. Now the Trump Admin has back-tracked:
.@realDonaldTrump wants to upgrade our nuclear arsenal AND end decades-old arms control agreements. That's a recipe for disaster. Congress must immediately pass my #NoFirstUse bill to prevent him (or any president) from unilaterally starting a nuclear war.
We can hold Russia accountable without tearing up the INF Treaty. Withdrawing won't make America any safer – it just increases the potential for a new arms race that would make the world even more dangerous.

The only purpose of the US nuclear arsenal should be deterrence. Retaining the right to use nuclear weapons first won’t make Americans safer. In fact, in increases the possibility of a dangerous miscalculation puts us – everyone else – at greater risk of nuclear devastation.
Here’s my entire bill on #NoFirstUse:
We should never be the first to use a nuclear weapon in a conflict. I'm proud to join with @RepAdamSmith, Chairman of @HASCDemocrats, to introduce a bill that formalizes what most Americans already believe: the United States should never initiate a nuclear war. #NoFirstUse
10 years ago today, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law. It was an important step, but far too many women – especially women of color – still don't receive #EqualPay for equal work. We've got to keep fighting.
The ultra-rich keep getting richer while 40% of Americans can’t come up with $400 in an emergency. That’s not a sustainable economy, or a sustainable democracy. My #UltraMillionaireTax makes the richest 0.1% pay more – and allows us to invest in opportunities for everyone.
Today I met with federal workers in Boston. They're glad to be back on the job (and getting paid) – but also deeply worried about whether or not the government will go into another shutdown.Federal workers shouldn't be used as pawns in the GOP's political games.
I could go on but I don't need to: it’s clear that Tim Sloan isn't the right person to try to clean up @WellsFargo. His hands are too dirty from overseeing years of scams and scandals. That’s not just an “informed” opinion. That’s a fact.
Of course, we can’t forget the most recent @WellsFargo scandal that took place right under Tim Sloan’s nose. The bank has been gouging students with triple the fees of its competitors on college campuses.
.@WellsFargo also agreed to pay $175 million to settle claims that it charged Black and Latino borrowers higher fees and rates on mortgages than white borrowers with similar credit profiles.
Then there are the 500+ customers who lost their homes because of a “calculation error” by @WellsFargo. And what did Tim Sloan do to make it right? Sent the families affected some inadequate checks.
Speaking of auto loans, that reminds me of the time @WellsFargo didn't provide refunds to tens of thousands of people who paid off their car loans early. What a great way to treat loyal customers!
Fake accounts were just one of the scandals that went down at @WellsFargo while Tim Sloan was part of the bank’s top leadership. There are a lot to choose from. Like when they charged hundreds of thousands of customers for auto insurance they didn’t need.
Remember the fake accounts scam that got @WellsFargo in trouble to begin with? As CFO and COO, Tim Sloan helped enable it. He got rich off it. And he tried to cover it up. How's he the right guy to clean up the mess?
Tim Sloan doesn't think I have an "informed" opinion about how he's helped lead @WellsFargo. But I’ve actually been paying pretty close attention, and I’ve got a long list of reasons why I think he should be fired. (Get comfortable, this is gonna take a while.)

Federal workers standing in food lines. Medical care put off. Credit ruined. Contractors who aren’t guaranteed back pay. So much suffering caused by the #TrumpShutdown, and for what? It's time to get our government back on track and working for the American people again.
Over a month ago, the Senate voted unanimously on a compromise to keep the gov't open. Trump refused to sign it. Republicans just voted down a new measure – so the #TrumpShutdown continues.How much longer do @realDonaldTrump @SenateGOP plan on holding federal workers hostage?
Wall Street fat cat Wilbur Ross is a millionaire many times over – so he can't seem to comprehend why missing a paycheck or two would devastate so many families. Newsflash @SecretaryRoss: Federal employees are hurting. Tell your boss to end the #TrumpShutdown.

I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again – the only thing that matters when it comes to allowing military personnel to serve is whether or not they can handle the job. Banning people from serving based on gender identity isn’t only shameful – it makes America less safe.
As we celebrate Dr. King's legacy, we must remember: "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly."
It can be hard to keep fighting. It requires every ounce of strength we have. But these are righteous fights, and as we work together for the good, we do not tire, we don't get distracted, and we don't lose heart. We keep going.

Don and the Massachusetts Military Support Foundation have been helping US Coast Guard families make ends meet by distributing thousands of pounds of food since the #TrumpShutdown began. The longer Republicans drag out this shutdown, the more hard-working families will suffer.
Wells Fargo has a record of cheating its customers. The latest victim? College students. A new @CFPB report shows the bank gouged students with triple the fees of its competitors. @WellsFargo doesn’t belong on college campuses.
We already knew that the Trump Administration ripped apart thousands of families – but a new report shows the real number is much, much higher. Separating even one child from their family is cruel and immoral. #FamiliesBelongTogether.
The House has already passed legislation to end the #TrumpShutdown, and the Senate could vote to send it to the President’s desk today. Instead, we're voting on a bill to further restrict reproductive rights. Time to get your priorities straight, @SenateMajLdr.

Puerto Rico receives far less Medicaid funding than states, hurting fellow US citizens. I've offered legislation to provide Medicaid parity to PR other US territories, called for hearings on the challenges facing PR's health system. This can't wait.
William Barr has already expressed his bias against the Mueller investigation – that alone should disqualify him from serving as Attorney General. He also wants to gut the ACA, thinks Roe v Wade should be overturned, has a troubling record on criminal justice. I'll vote no.
Giant companies may hate my Affordable Drug Manufacturing bill - but I don’t work for them. The American people deserve competitive markets and fair prices. By fixing the broken generic drug market, we can bring the cost of prescriptions
24 days into the #TrumpShutdown and over 800,000 federal employees have already missed 1 paycheck. How many more before Republicans stop crushing working families and re-open the government? Time to end this.
Up to 85,000 seniors, disabled Americans, and low income families are already at risk of losing their homes because of the #TrumpShutdown. That’s just plain cruel – it’s time for Republicans to stop playing politics and re-open the government.
Members of the US Coast Guard and other federal employees should be cashing their paychecks today. But thanks to the #TrumpShutdown, some will be visiting local food banks instead. This cannot continue – Republicans must re-open the government.
Mexico won't pay for @realDonaldTrump's stupid wall, and neither will Congress. So now, he's considering using dollars that were supposed to go to disaster recovery efforts in Puerto Rico, TX, CA elsewhere to fund his political stunt. Unacceptable.
Andrew Wheeler – a former lobbyist who spent his career helping Big Coal poison our environment – has been officially nominated to run the @EPA. Under my plan to #EndCorruptionNow, he wouldn't be allowed to get anywhere near that agency – much less run it.

American workers have helped create record corporate profits – but their wages have stayed flat for decades as companies reward CEOs and wealthy shareholders instead. My Accountable Capitalism Act would give workers a real voice in corporate decisions.
Lockouts are unsafe, unfair, and harmful to hard-working families. @SenMarkey and I are grateful that after difficult negotiations, the 6-month lockout by @NationalGridUS is finally over, and 1,250 @SteelWorkers workers will soon be back on the job.
The House has already passed bipartisan bills to end the #TrumpShutdown. I agree with @ChrisVanHollen. The Senate’s first and only order of business right now should be passing that same legislation. We need to re-open the government and get our federal employees back to work.
Rent and mortgage payments missed. Bills overdue. Savings dipped into. Hundreds of thousands of American families are hurting, and the longer the government is shut down, the worse it gets. It's time to end the #TrumpShutdown.
Corruption eats away at the heart of democracy. My bill to #EndCorruptionNow will make sure government represents the people – not just the wealthy and well-connected.
Residents in the Merrimack Valley need answers about the September 13th #MVGasFires, not more delays. We need to end the #TrumpShutdown now and stop hurting hard-working families.

Over 7,000 people in Massachusetts have been sent home or are working without pay during the #TrumpShutdown. Until @realDonaldTrump re-opens the government, I'm donating my salary to @HIASrefugees, a nonprofit that helps refugees and makes our country stronger in the process.
John Stumpf eventually lost his job as Wells Fargo’s CEO. But far too often, politicians run our government for the rich and powerful instead of holding them accountable. It's time to end Washington corruption and start building a government that works for all working people.
It's been over a week since a vital federal program supporting victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, stalking expired. @realDonaldTrump must end his shutdown work with Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act as soon as possible.
So many of these #ShutdownStories are truly heartbreaking. The #TrumpShutdown isn't some political game. It's hurting hard-working Americans. @realDonaldTrump must end it now.
Our government is supposed to work for working families. Instead: �25% of the federal government shut down.�380,000 workers sent home.�420,000 federal employees working without pay.Stop playing politics with people's lives, @realDonaldTrump. End the shutdown.
It's time for the Pentagon to come clean. The American people deserve to know the full scope of our operations assisting Saudi Arabia in Yemen. We need to hold our partners – and ourselves – accountable.
When I asked the Pentagon if they tracked US fuel and bombs used in Saudi airstrikes in Yemen, they said no. But new reports show that information was available to us all along. The reality is, US supported airstrikes have killed thousands of civilians.
The Senate voted unanimously on a compromise to keep the government open. @realDonaldTrump chose to reject it and go into another #TrumpShutdown.  The American people deserve better. They deserve a government that works for them.
Felipe Alonzo-Gomez was just 8 years old when he died on Christmas Eve while in CBP custody. CBP must provide answers about how this happened, and create stronger protections for people in its custody. The loss of even one child is too great – these tragedies cannot continue.
This Christmas Eve, Bonita Williams should be wrapping gifts for her grandkids. Instead, she's worrying about how she'll pay her electric bill. The #TrumpShutdown is hurting hard-working Americans. @realDonaldTrump must end it.
The Violence Against Women Act – which supports critical programs to help victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and stalking – expired at midnight. We could have funded it, but @realDonaldTrump would rather shut down the government for a wall that doesn’t make us any safer.
This shutdown was completely avoidable. Now, hundreds of thousands of federal employees will go without a paycheck over the holidays as @realDonaldTrump throws another temper tantrum over his stupid wall. Republicans’ latest attempt to divide and distract us.
The @DeptVetAffairs should be serving America's veterans, not helping @realDonaldTrump's Mar-a-Lago cronies line their pockets. It's time for the @VetAffairsOIG to finally investigate this corruption.
.@USCCRgov just issued a major new report about how the federal government is failing to meet its obligations to Native communities. We must take action. Congress could start by passing my housing bill to help end the shortage of housing in Indian Country.
Ethics officials at the Justice Dept recommended that Acting AG Whitaker recuse himself from the Mueller investigation – but he doesn't have to listen to them. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would create an independent ethics office to force federal officials to do what's right.

The federal deadline to sign up for health insurance has passed, but Massachusetts is special. We want everyone to #GetCovered, so our deadline is January 23rd. Visit today to find a plan that works for you and your family.
The Senate just passed the First Step Act, a bipartisan prison and sentencing reform bill that I supported. It includes important changes, but we've still got a long way to go. I'll keep fighting for a criminal justice system that delivers on the promise of equal justice for all.
Giant companies spent $1 trillion in giveaways from the #GOPTaxScam to juice their share price pad CEO pay – but wages hardly budged. My Accountable Capitalism Act would help ensure workers get a fair share of the record-breaking profits they help
Exhibit #237 of how Congress is broken. We worked all year to pass @SenatorHeitkamp's bill to fight the epidemic of missing and murdered Native women and girls. We convinced all 100 Senators! Now it's on life support because of 1 retiring Congressman? Pass #SavannasAct.
The generic drug market is clearly broken, and it's time to fix it. Giant companies will hate my Affordable Drug Manufacturing plan. But I don’t work for them. The American people deserve competitive markets and fair prices.
The federal government already contracts to produce vaccines and drugs for national emergencies. By publicly manufacturing generic drugs, my plan would:�Lower skyrocketing drug prices.�Increase competition in the generic drug market.�Help address urgent medicine shortages.
The majority of generic prescription drugs are manufactured by just 2 companies. The lack of competition has twisted the market driven up prices. I’m introducing the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act with @janschakowsky to fix this broken market bring down costs for families.
It's been well over a year since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and the island still needs all the help it can get. I've been very glad to see small businesses in Massachusetts coming to the aid of our fellow US
With Ryan Zinke finally out, his deputy could take over the Interior Dept. David Bernhardt, an ex Big Oil lobbyist, has spent his career working to poison our environment for profit. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would keep this walking conflict of interest from getting promoted.
This ruling can’t go into effect while we continue to fight it in the courts. You can still sign up for health insurance in 2019 – but you must do it today. Go to right now and #GetCovered.
Republicans have tried over over again to repeal the Affordable Care Act in Congress, failed every time. Now they’re trying to use the courts to strip health care from millions of Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions. We’ll fight this every step of the way.
Heartbroken for this child her family. Heartbroken that this is happening in the United States of America. Every person should be treated with dignity compassion, no matter which side of the border they come from. CBP must provide answers about how this tragedy happened.
I’m proud to partner with @repbenraylujan, @repmarkpocan, @RepStephenLynch, @CongBoyle, @janschakowsky on the Accountable Capitalism Act, which they introduced in the House yesterday. With their support, we’re closer to helping workers get the higher wages they deserve.
For years, I’ve been pushing @usedgov to discharge the loans of students who attended the shady #4profit, Corinthian Colleges. @BetsyDeVosEd tried every trick in the book to get out of it, but a judge over-ruled her. This is great news for students.
Honored to deliver the Commencement address this morning at @MorganStateU, an institution that cultivates strong leaders who fight for equality, justice and opportunity. Tune in live here:
I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of #SavannasAct. This bill is uncontroversial and a crucial step forward to address a tragic problem afflicting Native communities. The Senate has already passed it unanimously. The House should too.
It's time to hold our allies ourselves accountable for the devastation in Yemen. Today, we're 1 step closer. The Senate just passed S.J. Res 54, which I proudly co-sponsored, to end US support for Saudi Arabia's war.Now, @SpeakerRyan @HouseGOP must stop dodging step up.
RT @SenateDems: Saturday is the last day to enroll, re-enroll, or change your health insurance for 2019! Don’t wait! #GetCovered today: h…
The housing crisis is especially hard on communities of color that have faced decades of discrimination. My bill, introduced in the House by @RepRichmond, @RepGwenMoore, @RepBarbaraLee, and @RepCummings, would help families buy homes and close the racial wealth gap.
RT @RepBonamici: Today, @SenWarren and I led our House and Senate colleagues in calling on Sec. DeVos to rescind the decision to reinstate…
Dictators around the world are shelling out millions of dollars to Washington lobbyists to try and curry favor with @realDonaldTrump. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would ban Americans from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments.
Last year, @WellsFargo CEO Tim Sloan told me he really values his employees. Since then, he’s announced plans to fire more than 20k of them while dedicating $60 billion to stock buybacks for shareholders (like himself). I’d say it’s pretty clear what he values.
RT @RepBarbaraLee: Incredibly proud to support @SenWarren @RepRichmond’s American Housing Economic Mobility Act. This bill is a roadmap…
My American Housing Economic Mobility Act would cut rents by 10%, invest in people living in historically redlined communities, create 1.5M jobs. I'm proud to join @OfficialCBC Chairman @RepRichmond as he introduces it in the House today. Tune in now:
From reporters and editors to press operators and custodial staff, workers at the @DailyHampGaz and the @ValleyAdvocate produce high-quality local journalism. They have the right to make their voices heard and unionize. I'm with them in this fight.
Just like the hateful terrorism of Al Qaeda and ISIS, domestic right-wing terrorism is completely incompatible with our American values. It is a threat to American safety and security, and we must not tolerate it in the United States.
The generic drug market is broken. Companies are allegedly colluding behind the scenes to keep prices high, while American families pay the price. Later this month, I'll introduce new legislation to help put a stop to this bring down costs for
There are just 5 days left to #GetCovered for 2019. Go to to find a plan that works for you and your family!
As head of the @EPA, Andrew Wheeler is supposed to regulate the coal industry. Instead, the former coal lobbyist is making it easier for his buddies to pollute our air. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would slam the revolving door shut on ex-lobbyists like Wheeler.
Our brave firefighters truly do put their lives on the line, each and every day they’re on the job. My heart goes out to the entire @WorcesterFD, as well as the family and friends of Firefighter Christopher Roy.
I saw firsthand how @DHSgov separated mothers from their babies in detention. The world watched as they tear gassed migrant children seeking asylum. None of it has made our country any safer – and neither will spending billions of taxypayer dollars on a border wall.
On National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day, I’m thinking of Betty, and the millions of Americans who stepped up to serve when their country needed them most. Thank you for your service.
The US Cadet Nurse Corps Service Recognition Act will recognize former Cadet Nurses’ service to our country and provide them with honorable discharges, ribbon and medal privileges, and burial privileges.
Betty Beecher was one of 120,000 women who served as Cadet Nurses during WWII. I talked with her about her years of service, and my bipartisan bill to honor America’s Cadet Nurses.
.@FEMA should be using taxpayer dollars to repair homes in Puerto Rico that were destroyed after Hurricane Maria – not helping companies with ties to @realDonaldTrump line their own pockets. I’m calling on @DHSOIG to investigate.
The VA is supposed to serve the healthcare needs of America's veterans – not the business interests of @realDonaldTrump's Mar-a-Lago cronies. I've already gotten an independent gov’t watchdog to investigate, and I’ll keep pushing the @VetAffairsOIG to fully address this scandal.
Kathy Kraninger has no interest in fighting for American families zero experience standing up for consumers. The @SenateGOP just voted to put her in charge of the @CFPB anyway.Kraninger may be on the side of cheating companies – but I won't stop fighting for working families.
US firms shouldn’t do the dirty work of repressive regimes and ruthless dictators. My plan to #EndCorruptionNow would ban Americans from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments. If other countries want to make their case, they can use their diplomats.
Last week, I asked MSL Group and other US lobbying firms to explain their work representing the interests of Saudi Arabia in the wake of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. MSL responded that they’re continuing business as usual and still working for the Saudis.
