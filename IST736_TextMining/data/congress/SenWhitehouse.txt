I’m glad to see @uscourts still understands that impartiality of the federal judiciary must be protected from special interests pushing a narrow policy agenda favoring big partisan donors.
Dark money-funded @Heritage “training sessions” for judicial clerks featuring federal judges raise serious alarm bells.
Wow! The middle-of-the-road @USATODAY comes out strong! #Climatechange “a true crisis facing the United States and the world”; “The public is growing impatient”; “fossil-fuel polluters keep using the atmosphere as a free waste dump.”
The #Trump @EPA claims to believe in cooperative federalism. Ha! They really believe in cooperative corporatism, where states like #RI get rolled unless their interests align with the fossil fuel industry. It’s a sham. #TimeToWakeUp
The brief shows that as far back as 1959, Big Oil knew of the risks of their products took “proactive steps to conceal their knowledge and discredit climate science” while at the same time protecting their own assets from the effects of #climatechange.
For this week #TimeToWakeUp speech, I discuss a court brief filed by scientific experts in a California case against Big Oil.
True. Thanks, #CitizensUnited. Democracy at stake.
“In our era, it is primarily Congress that prevents popular laws from being passed or getting serious consideration.... Entire categories of public policy options are effectively off-limits because of the combined influence of industry groups and donor interests.”
It was great to meet with members from @artistresidency to discuss RI art initiatives. We have a booming #art scene in #RI that adds to the character of our state the quality of life for residents. I will continue supporting these programs on the federal level.
Shadowy means not disclosing donors, particularly when you’re handpicking judges.So for inquiring minds, the @FedSoc I’m talking about doesn’t disclose its funders and controls judicial appointments – which by definition makes them shadowy.Make sense?
Yet another way in which the political menace of the fossil fuel industry works its mischief. They can’t even leave electric cars alone.

Congratulations to @JimLangevin on being named Senior Whip for the 116th Congress! It’s a big win for #RhodeIsland to have Jim in this senior role. It’s also a smart move for House leadership to tap Jim’s expertise in critical areas like #cybersecurity.
The expertise independence of federal agencies is a vital check on the corporate influencers seeking to seize control of their regulators. The Court should be wary of upsetting this decades-old balance.
Agencies like the @EPA, @USDOL, and the SEC work to protect the public from everything from pollution to unsafe work environments to financial fraud.

With great fanfare, @exxonmobil pledged $1M to a not-yet-operational carbon pricing advocacy group; meanwhile industry-funded groups including this one spend millions more to make sure that carbon pricing doesn’t happen. What a racket.

#RhodeIsland’s own Bristol-built Herreshoff S boats got a big article, and the cover, in @WoodenBoatMag.
All this conservative happy talk is very nice in theory, but as long as #Republicans in Congress still dance to the political tune of big #climate deniers and political donors like the @USChamber, the Koch brothers and the @APIenergy, it’s just happy talk.
Unfortunately, other networks are still lagging behind. On @FoxNewsSunday, Rush Limbaugh spouted pure #climate denial and went completely unchecked by host Chris Wallace. Not a good look, even for Fox. #TimeToWakeUp
.@MTP @CNNSotu both made a concerted effort this month to keep the public informed highlight what scientists are telling us about our #climate crisis. Kudos to them for starting to correct course.
The numbers are in. This month, #climatechange was mentioned 10 times on Sunday shows’ programming 7 of these were part of a substantial discussion on #climate. A big increase from last month. That’s progress�.
But there are still sane voices even in this White House.
When it comes to #climate science, the White House calls in the quacks.  Unbelievable. But true. 
We need to assure that jobs and contracts don’t get sucked up to Boston, that medical procedures and expertise don’t get sucked up to Boston, that Brown’s medical school doesn’t become a stepchild to Harvard’s, and that we don’t lose charge of our health care destiny.
To level the playing field between citizens these powerful wrongdoers, I’ve introduced the Safety Over Forced #Arbitration Act. This bill would safeguard the right to a fair open trial for all and bar secret settlements that endanger public health. #EndForcedArbitration
For too long, the spread of forced arbitration agreements has allowed #polluters and bad actors to defy the court system and cover up the health risks they’ve exposed Americans to.

As a reminder, @senatemajldr McConnell, we challenged you to a debate on #climate. Bring it on.

But of course @realDonaldTrump’s ambassadors are often less qualified but have made bigger donations than ever before. He didn’t drain the swamp, he spread it overseas.
If @senatemajldr McConnell wants a vote on #climate, he’s going to have to talk about climate, and it’s about damned time he did.
The good news is #Republicans have the bad judgment to try to force a cynical vote on the #GreenNewDeal, a measure theywant to fail. To that we say BRING IT
Simply put, @SenateGOP HAVE NO PLAN to address #climatechange. Zero. Zilch. None whatsoever. And they have no plan because their fossil fuel donors oppose #climate action.
But that’s not a big surprise. The silence from Republicans on #climatechange has been deafening for years now, even as a growing majority of Americans – including Americans who vote #Republican – say they want climate action.
A week after we challenged @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell to cop to the reality of #climatechange – radio silence.
