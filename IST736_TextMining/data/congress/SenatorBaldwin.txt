Forward Janesville (@Fwd_Janesville) is a champion in building up brighter futures for Rock County residents and families. Thanks for the great visit this week!
Higher education should be a path to prosperity, not debt. That’s why I’m introducing the #DebtFreeCollege Act to provide relief to #WI students by creating a state-federal partnership to make higher education more affordable and help graduates get ahead.
President Trump promised to ‘drain the swamp,’ but the revolving door keeps spinning with Wall Street insiders, corporate executives and long-term industry lobbyists moving from the private sector to public service and back again. #StopTheRevolvingDoor #ForthePeople
The American people can’t afford to have government officials in the pocket of the corporate special interests that already have too much power in Washington. Let's end the practice of corporate insiders being rewarded with big golden parachute bonuses. #ForthePeople
Together, we will #StopTheRevolvingDoor and make sure that government officials are working on behalf of the public interest and our common good, not powerful special interests. #ForthePeople
#BREAKING The House just passed sweeping reform legislation that expands voting rights and takes on conflicts of interest in President Trump’s administration, including my legislation to #StopTheRevolvingDoor between corporate America, Wall Street and Washington. #ForthePeople
I met with our Wisconsin VFW members this week to discuss how we can continue working together to support our veterans and their families. Thank you for your service to Wisconsin!
Thanks to my friend Diane and the entire @MSSociety for your partnership and advocacy. Together, we will keep fighting to make sure our patients and families get the medication they need, at a price they can afford.
I’ve heard from countless Wisconsinites who can’t afford the rising price of their prescriptions. We have a broken system in Washington, and I will keep working to fix it.
Thank you to my dear friend Diane (@dmwhitcraftMS) for presenting me with the @MSSociety 2018 Senator of the Year Award! Diane’s fight inspires me every day to keep pushing for progress so no one has to choose between affording their medication and draining their savings.
On #InternationalWomensDay let’s celebrate all who came before us to break down barriers, fight for equality and empower women girls around the world. �
I reintroduced my Air Carrier Access Amendments Act because equal access to air travel is about fairness and freedom. Together, we will enhance the rights and safety of airline passengers with disabilities, including our veterans.
Democrats Republicans rejected funding for President Trump’s border wall.Democrats Republicans oppose his national emergency declaration.Democrats Republicans oppose President Trump taking money from our military to fund a wall that he promised Mexico would pay for.
Always a pleasure meeting with @LaCrosseMayor Tim Kabat. Thanks for the visit!
I am so proud of Layne from Wauwatosa and AllysonLee from La Crosse for representing Wisconsin in the U.S. Senate Youth Program. Thank you for your hard work and congrats on receiving such a great honor!
I was honored to be recognized by the Digestive Disease National Coalition (@TheDDNC) this week.I will continue working to support @NIH funding and improve access to quality, affordable health care.
I was proud to work with @FarmFirstDairy and deliver results for Wisconsin in the 2018 #FarmBill. I will keep working to make sure our #WI dairy farmers have the tools to be successful and move our state forward. Thanks for the visit yesterday!
The Trump tax bill created an explosion of corporate stock buybacks that are looting public companies, rewarding wealth preventing investment in workers wages. It’s time to rein in buybacks, give workers a voice on corporate boards and #RewardWork.
My new bipartisan bankruptcy reform with @JohnCornyn is about protecting the disability benefits our veterans earned and their families depend on. We need to provide financial security for those who have served.
The House passed bipartisan background check legislation.I have helped introduce the Senate counterpart bill, the Background Check Expansion Act.I'm standing with @ChrisMurphyCT and calling for Judiciary Committee hearings on our universal background checks legislation.
Big oil and corporate polluters have so much power � over Senate Republicans that they will deny reality.Drop the lies about � and � and confront climate change as the very real threat it is to public health, national security and our economy. #ActOnClimate
Senate Republicans refuse to say these simple things:Climate change is real Human activity causes climate changeCongress needs to take bold and urgent action to address climate change.Why? Don't they believe in science?
Last year, after the Senate voted to #SaveTheNet, Paul Ryan ran out the clock on #NetNeutrality in the House. This time, it’s our House. Today, Democrats in both the Senate and House are introducing the Save The Internet Act and we’re going to send it to Donald Trump’s desk.
The internet doesn’t belong to Donald Trump, Ajit Pai, or the big broadband companies. Let’s pass @SenateDems’ new Save The Internet Act and return the internet to the American people. #SaveTheNet
I believe that the internet should belong to the American people, not massive corporations. That’s why I’m joining 44 Senators today to introduce the Save The Internet Act that restores #NetNeutrality #SaveTheNet
I am introducing the #DebtFreeCollege Act with @SenBrianSchatz @repmarkpocan to provide relief to America’s students by creating a state-federal partnership to make higher education more affordable and help graduates get ahead.
College costs and student loan debt are holding back an entire generation and creating a drag on economic growth for our country.
Higher education should be a path to prosperity, not debt.Student debt has doubled since 2009 to more than $1.5 trillion.There is a debt crisis in America and Washington needs to step up and do something about it. #DebtFreeCollege
My Air Carrier Access Amendments Act will protect the rights of disabled airplane passengers, improve air travel safety and close service gaps that passengers with disabilities frequently encounter in air travel.
We need to break down barriers for individuals with disabilities when they travel. Equal access to air travel for people with disabilities is about fairness freedom and my legislation will do right by airline passengers with disabilities, including our veterans.
Too many travelers with disabilities encounter significant barriers—such as damaged assistive devices and wheelchairs, delayed assistance, ineffective communications, and lack of seating accommodations.
Thanks to @WIVetsChamber for their support of the bipartisan #HireStudentVeteransAct. We must do more to help veterans finish their education pursue new careers.
The President talks a lot about Buy American, Hire American but the Trump Admin is not enforcing #MadeInUSA standards. I want to know why they’re allowing companies to falsely market their goods as American-made when they’re actually engaging in
I’m going to keep working so kids like Aidan have the health care they need at a price #WI families can afford. #EnsuringLastingSmiles
Pretty cool to meet some of the cadets from the Wisconsin Civil Air Patrol last week in Washington, D.C. @wiwgcap is building the next generation of American aerospace leaders and making sure our young people have an opportunity to succeed.
We can’t let a lack of transportation hold people back from reaching jobs putting their skills to work. My bipartisan #COMMUTEAct invests in transportation so workers families can get where they need to go and keep our #MadeinWI economy moving.
A genuine Wisconsin tradition. Happy #PaczkiDay, everyone! Be sure to support local #MadeInWI small businesses by getting a few delicious treats today. #FatTuesday
I support the House resolution to block the president’s emergency declaration. The Constitution is very clear that Congress has the power of the purse. President Trump can’t just steal the purse, take money from our military and spend it on whatever he wants to.
We must do more to make high quality child care more affordable for families. My legislation would create 770,000 new child care jobs allow 1.6 million parents to go back to work. It would also lift one million families out of poverty.
Proud of our @MarquetteU Golden Eagles Women's basketball team as they claimed the outright 2019 #BIGEASTwbb title for the first time in program history! Go @MarquetteWBB! #WeAreMarquette #muwbb
You’ve done good @jonlovett. @culvers #butterburger #MadeinWI
Insurance companies should not be allowed to deny coverage for medically-necessary dental procedures.Kids like Aidan should get the comprehensive health treatments and coverage they need at a price they can afford.My bipartisan legislation will make that a reality.
For working parents in Wisconsin struggling to get ahead, high-quality, affordable child care is out of reach for too many. That’s why I worked with @PattyMurray to introduce legislation to lower costs and ensure more families have access to affordable child care. #ChildCare4All
Congratulations to the Brookfield students at Wisconsin Hills Middle School (@WHMS_SDE) on qualifying for the 2019 National Science Bowl Finals! #NSB2019
It's a new day in Wisconsin and about time we had a state budget that has the right priorities and reflects our values. @GovEvers is cutting taxes for working families, investing in students, expanding quality health care and putting people to work fixing our roads.  #WI4Us
We have a shared responsibility to do right by our veterans and help them find a good job after their military service. I joined @SenJackyRosen on the bipartisan #HireStudentVeteransAct to support veterans finishing their education pursuing new careers.
My good friend @LGMandelaBarnes made history last year as the first African American Lieutenant Governor in our state’s history. Thank you, Mandela, for everything you do to move Wisconsin #Forward! #BlackHistoryMonth
This week, the House is moving forward on commonsense gun safety reforms that will help save lives. The overwhelming majority of Americans support background checks for all gun purchases. It’s time for the Senate to take action too so we can #EndGunViolence
Andrew Wheeler spent years lobbying for special interests that are a direct threat to clean air, clean water public health. He will not provide leadership we need at EPA to take on polluters, confront climate change protect our environment. I vote
In #WI, we have a long tradition of investing in quality education – including #CareerTechEd.I’m celebrating #CTEMonth because when we provide students with the skills they need to succeed, we can also help businesses create stronger economic growth. #CTEWorks
Putin directed an attack on our American democracy Russia interfered with our elections. The ongoing investigations by Special Counsel Mueller and federal prosecutors must continue unobstructed so the truth can be revealed to the American people.
President Trump's longtime personal lawyer provided compelling testimony under oath that paints a very dark picture and the documents he turned over to Congress raise deeply troubling questions about the President's conduct as a candidate and in the White House.
I am always impressed by our #WI students who are conducting academic research as part of the Washington Seminar program. Thank you for your hard work and thoughtful questions!
I met with the @WIlegion this week to discuss providing our veterans and their families the support and resources they deserve. Thank you for your service to our state and nation!
A bipartisan majority of the Wisconsin Congressional delegation supports doing the right thing. We need to block President Trump's unlawful power grab to take money from our military and make American taxpayers fund an ineffective wall that he promised Mexico would pay for.
For too long, powerful drug corporations have been jacking up the prices on medications that American families rely on.It’s time to do something about it.We should demand transparency for price hikes pass real solutions that will lower costs.
I will never stop working to provide #WI children with the health services they deserve. Thanks for visiting today!
Aidan from Slinger continues to inspire me with his tireless advocacy for individuals born with congenital anomalies or birth defects. I’m proud to be your partner in this fight, and I’m not going to stop until we pass my bipartisan #EnsuringLastingSmiles Act.
Today, I met with rare disease advocates from Wisconsin because we need to make sure our families and patients can get the health care they need at a price they can afford.
RT @NFED_ORG: Thank you, @SenatorBaldwin and @SenJoniErnst for reintroducing and co-sponsoring the #EnsuringLastingSmilesAct in the U.S. Se…
Trump gave huge, permanent tax breaks to big corporations they used it to spend $1 TRILLION on stock buybacks that mainly benefit wealthy shareholders top execs. It’s time to rewrite the rules so our economy rewards workers, and not just wealth.
The bipartisan #EnsuringLastingSmiles Act closes that coverage gap to ensure health plans cover medically necessary services related to birth defects, including any serious dental oral-related procedures. Thanks @SenJoniErnst @SenSherrodBrown @lisamurkowski for your support!
Aidan was born with Ectodermal Dysplasia and needed intense oral dental care. Despite having comprehensive health insurance, his family was denied coverage for Aidan’s dental work and forced to pay thousands out of pocket for his treatments.
Today I’m so proud to reintroduce the #EnsuringLastingSmiles Act. I worked with 14 yr-old Aidan from Slinger, WI on this important reform to guarantee that those born with congenital anomalies have access to the comprehensive health treatments and coverage they need.
Americans expect products labeled “Made in the USA” to be just that – made by American workers with American-made products. @FTC isn’t enforcing these standards, so I’m demanding answers.
I’m working to provide our #MadeinWI craft brewers the tax relief they need so they can invest in their workers and grow their small business.
.@LaCasaWI carries a strong legacy of doing right by Waukesha’s children and families. I’m so happy I was able to join you to celebrate La Casa’s 53rd Anniversary and recognize your important work in helping #WI families reach their full potential.
Today I got a crochet lesson from the best in the business! Thanks for showing me the ropes, Jonah. Crochet away, Wisconsinites! �
Thank you to the @MOSESConference for having me today! I’m incredibly proud to represent Wisconsin’s organic farmers and will continue working to do right by our agriculture economy. #MOSES2019
Learn more about this reform to provide permanent tax cuts and update regulations for our craft breweries so we can level the playing field and allow these innovators to further grow and
I’m in La Crosse today to meet with Phil and tour 608 Brewing Company! @608BrewCo was founded by a group of friends who love craft beer want to produce a great product for La Crosse residents. We need to make it easier for them to grow their business.
We must ensure that when our nation’s veterans need emergency care, they can get the care they need aren’t stuck with huge bills. The Trump Admin should do right by our veterans, follow the intent of the law stop severely limiting their
.@GoodCityBrewing has demonstrated a strong commitment to making #MKE a better place. Thanks for having me today – cheers!
I helped reintroduce the bipartisan Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act to permanently cut taxes and modernize outdated regulations for our brewers to grow and succeed.
Wisconsin is home to more than 160 craft breweries, including @GoodCityBrewing. I’m proud to support tax relief for them and other brewers throughout #WI so they can invest in our workers and our communities.
In Wisconsin, we make great beer, and the folks at @GoodCityBrewing know that best. It was great visiting their new location in Milwaukee today to talk about how we can support our #MadeInWI craft brewery industry.
It’s true! I’m headed to @GoodCityBrewing today to meet with their team and talk about my reform to help local craft brewers create jobs, invest in workers and boost our #MadeInWI economy.
Congratulations to student scientist Aayush Karan from Muskego, one of just 40 students named finalists in #RegeneronSTS 2019! You are making Wisconsin proud, Aayush. Good luck!
Wisconsin craft brewers create jobs and help grow our economy. We need to give them permanent tax relief so they can invest in workers, grow their business keep moving our #MadeinWI economy forward.
Too many women in Wisconsin don’t have access to an OB-GYN and have to drive over an hour to get the care they need. That’s unacceptable. That’s why I worked across party lines to pass a new law to improve health care for women by bringing more OB-GYNs to rural communities.
Thanks @SecPompeo for highlighting this issue urging Poland to pass restitution legislation for those who lost property during the Holocaust era. We have more work to do and I will keep working to ensure justice for Holocaust victims, their families and heirs.
Lloyd Barbee was a civil rights champion who fought against segregation in our schools and promoted equality throughout our state. I’m proud to honor his important work and remember his life during #BlackHistoryMonth
Milwaukee represents! There isn’t anything better than a strong @Bucks showing at the #NBAAllStar Game with @Giannis_An34, @Khris22m and Coach Bud. Go Team #Giannis! #FearTheDeer
It’s clear Washington must do more to be a stronger partner in fighting the opioid crisis. I am proud to reintroduce the LifeBOAT Act with @Sen_JoeManchin to create a permanent funding stream for treatment so we can save
.@CFPB must stop undermining consumer protections. They need to do their job to hold predatory lenders accountable and prevent these lending scams from hurting the American people.
Today we’re remembering the life of Bryan Rodriguez, a dedicated @cityofmilwaukeepublic servant who tragically lost his life doing his job and serving our community. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.
Happy #NationalWisconsinDay and thanks to all the hardworking people who move us #Forward. #OnWisconsin
I introduced the #MedicareAt50 Act to give millions of older Americans another choice for more affordable, quality health insurance coverage.
I have serious concerns about the delayed response to contamination of groundwater in Marinette. Wisconsinites need to know if their drinking water is safe.
It was an honor meeting with Jewish War Veterans of Wisconsin Commander Kim Queen yesterday to thank him for his service to our state and our nation. Thank you for all you do for our veterans!
Thanks to @WisconsinMC for having me join you at #WIDCFlyIn. I will keep working to support #WI manufacturers and small businesses, and build a #MadeInWI economy that works for everyone.
I’m working to lower health care costs and expand quality coverage by making sure Wisconsinites have more options for affordable health care. I joined @SenBrianSchatz to introduce legislation that would allow states to create a Medicaid buy-in program.
Both Democrats and Republicans oppose the President declaring a national emergency and taking money from our military, or anywhere else, to pay for a wall that he promised Mexico would pay for. This is a bad idea. Doesn’t the President have enough legal problems already?
The Trump shutdown accomplished nothing and hurt a lot of people. Congress has worked together to fund the government, including homeland security. President Trump should sign this bipartisan legislation and end his opposition to providing back pay to federal contractor workers.
I met with the Wisconsin Medical Society (@WisMed) yesterday to discuss issues impacting our state’s physician workforce. Thanks for all you do for #WI patients and families!
It was great welcoming our new State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski (@WITreasurer) to DC! I look forward to working together to move Wisconsin #Forward!
I’m grateful for my strong partnership with @FoxValleyTech as we continue working to strengthen the workforce of today and tomorrow. Thank you for visiting this week and helping me celebrate #CTEMonth!
Last night the House Judiciary Committee passed legislation to require universal background checks and it will go to the floor for a vote. The Senate should do the same thing so we can save lives.
On the one year anniversary of the tragic #ParklandSchoolShooting I honor the memory of the 17 people who had their lives taken away and pledge to keep working on commonsense gun reform. #MSDStrong
We should be working together to make quality health care more affordable, not rewriting the rules on the guaranteed protections that millions of families depend on. #NoJunkPlans
Trump’s junk insurance plans aren’t worth the paper they’re written on. I joined @MarkWarner, @SenatorShaheen @SenatorCardin to stop the Trump admin from using taxpayer money to fund junk plans that don't have to cover pre-existing conditions.
Wisconsin has long been a national leader in conservation, with a proud tradition of hunting, fishing enjoying the great outdoors.  I pushed to #SaveLWCF with a permanent funding reauth so we preserve our natural resources for future
Health care costs are too high in this country, and many Americans still can’t find the care they need at a price they can afford. #MedicareAt50 will give millions of older Americans another choice for more affordable, quality health insurance coverage.
Today, I’m joining @SenStabenow to introduce #MedicareAt50! This reform will expand access to affordable health care and lower costs for American families. Follow along live here:
The rest of the country finally agrees: there’s nothing better than a butter burger. Congrats, @Culvers! �
What better way to celebrate #CTEMonth than highlighting my support for career and technical education.
My pleasure! Thank you for the work you do and inspiration you share with each of us.
Today, I voted to #SaveLWCF and reauthorize permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund so we can protect our public lands for future generations.
Last fall, I was grateful for the chance to meet with hunters, anglers and sportsmen to discuss the importance of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Wisconsinites understand that our natural resources are critical to our quality of life and our #MadeInWI economy.
Now more than ever, the American people need an Attorney General who we can trust to act with independence. I will not support President Trump’s nominee, William Barr. My full statement:
The #FAMILYAct is an important step forward in building an economy that works for everyone. When families have stronger economic security, we will create stronger growth for our economy.  Thanks @SenGillibrand @rosadelauro for continuing to push for #paidleave for families.
Proud to join my friend colleague on the bipartisan #GlobalHERAct which would permanently repeal the Trump Administration’s harmful #GlobalGagRule. We should help expand access to health programs for women around the world.
Some of America’s greatest treasures are our National Monuments we need to safeguard them for future generations. That’s why I support @SenatorTomUdall’s legislation to protect these historic monuments from the Trump admin’s attacks on our public
Thanks everyone for the birthday wishes! Got to celebrate today with my staff and my favorite dessert - double chocolate cupcakes! �
If you haven’t already, take a moment today to learn about Vel’s incredible life spent breaking down barriers and fighting to move our great state
Vel was a trailblazer for African Americans in Wisconsin and across this country, and she spent her life fighting for social justice and to make a difference in people's lives. I will never forget her and the important legacy she leaves behind. #BlackHistoryMonth
Proud to support #CREATESAct, a bipartisan solution to make prescription drugs more affordable. It’s past time for @POTUS to work w/ Congress to pass real legislative solutions like this that will lower costs for millions struggling to afford medication.
We have a broken system in Washington that prohibits the federal government from negotiating with drug companies for lower prescription drugs prices. This reform will save taxpayers money and safeguard Medicare for years to come. Let’s get it done.
Wisconsin is home to world class universities our international education system lives up to our state motto: #Forward. That’s why I’m working with @SenToddYoung to strengthen international programs that foster innovation boost our local economies.
America lost a legend tonight. I had the honor of serving on the House @EnergyCommerce with John Dingell and "The Dean" was a leader in our effort to move the Affordable Care Act forward. He will be missed and always remembered for making a difference in people's lives.
The latest move from the Trump admin will allow predatory payday lenders to once again exploit the financial hardships facing millions of hardworking families.American consumers need a watchdog @CFPB, not a lap
Today I’m reintroducing my PARTNERS Act to scale up apprenticeship programs provide more people with skills they need to succeed. If we invest in public-private partnerships, we can give our businesses the skilled workers they need to grow our economy.
I have supported a bipartisan effort to delist the gray wolf in Wisconsin since 2011 and I support a vote on @SenRonJohnson’s bipartisan amendment to the Natural Resources Management Act to delist and return management of the wolf to Wisconsin.
That’s why I’m joining @SenSherrodBrown and @SenAmyKlobuchar to introduce legislation that will unleash the bargaining power of Medicare to help seniors get the medication they need at a price they can afford.
I’ve heard stories from countless Wisconsinites who are struggling to afford their medication. They want Washington to act. It’s past time for President Trump to work with Congress to pass important reforms that will help lower costs for seniors and their families.
Today I’m introducing new legislation to help lower the cost of prescription drugs for American seniors and save taxpayers money. Follow along here:
Wisconsin is home to the 2nd largest number of organic farms in the nation. I worked with @OrganicTrade to make sure the 2018 #FarmBill stands up for our organic farmers ensures American consumers get the high quality, organic food they expect. Thanks for the visit today!
Such a pleasure meeting with #WI Tribal Colleges. For years, the Menominee Nation Ojibwa Community Colleges have provided Native students with access to higher education on their own reservations. We must reauthorize the Higher Education Act to support Wisconsin tribes.
We can’t lose sight of the fact that voting rights remain under attack in our country. The struggle to protect the right to vote is essential to the broader struggle for economic social justice. We must work to break down barriers so everyone’s voice is heard in our Democracy.
This #BlackHistoryMonth I’m honoring and celebrating Wisconsin civil rights leaders like Ezekiel Gillespie, who won a landmark voting rights case with the #WI Supreme Court and moved our state #Forward in 1866.
We lost a brave public servant today when a @MilwaukeePolice officer was fatally shot in the line of duty. My thoughts are with the family and MPD as our community mourns this tragic loss of life.
In @SecAzar’s confirmation hearing, I told him about Wisconsinites struggling to afford insulin asked why Eli Lilly + others keep increasing prices. He blamed “the system” and gave no real answers. That’s not good enough. The Trump admin must work with us to bring down costs.
In recent years, the cost of insulin has skyrocketed. We need answers from these drug companies who are jacking up prices on the insulin that millions of Americans with Diabetes rely on to live.
RT @_ACHP: Thank you @SenatorBaldwin for the great conversation today. Look forward to continuing to work together on critical #healthcare…
Diane and I are heading in to the State of the Union. It’s time for President Trump to keep his promise to work with Congress on real legislative solutions to help Wisconsin families get the medication they need, at a price they can afford. We’ll be watching! #SOTU
Diane is one of the countless Wisconsinites I’ve heard from who can't afford the medicine they need. She’s joining me tonight for #SOTU2019 because she wants us to take on #BigPharma and lower the cost of prescription drugs.
I have joined @SenAmyKlobuchar on legislation to unleash the bargaining power of seniors for a better deal on prescription drug costs. We need to get this done because it will lower costs for seniors and save taxpayers
We have a broken system in Washington that prohibits the federal government from negotiating lower prescription drug prices in Medicare. President Trump said he supported this in 2016 but has done nothing about it. Washington must act to lower the cost of prescription drugs.
President Trump and Congressional Republicans gave huge tax breaks to the top 1% and big corporations. #BigPharma got billions in tax breaks, announced corporate stock buybacks and hiked the price of medications that Wisconsinites need. We need to take on big drug companies.
I’m so glad Diane is with me today for #SOTU2019. We’re sending a message to President Trump that Washington must act on real solutions to lower the cost of prescription drugs. We need to help Wisconsin families get the medication they need, at a price they can afford.
Wishing Hammerin’ Hank Aaron a happy 85th birthday today! He will always be a #MKE favorite. #ThisIsMyCrew #BlackHistoryMonth
Big corporations got huge, permanent tax breaks and they have announced $900 billion in stock buybacks that largely benefit wealthy shareholders and C-suite executives.Too many workers got pink slips.My #RewardWork Act is about giving workers a voice and investing in them.
On #WorldCancerDay let us remember those we lost and commit ourselves to making sure cancer patients and survivors have access to high-quality, affordable health insurance. No repeal or rollbacks of guaranteed health care protections and comprehensive coverage.
I saw firsthand the damage to our roads and bridges after last year’s devastating flooding and storms. That’s why I worked to bring more than $21 million to the impacted Wisconsin communities so they can rebuild and come back stronger than ever.
Diane has MS and had been taking the same medication for more than 23 years. The price of her prescription therapy jumped year after year and her out of pocket costs have drained her savings. She can no longer afford the medicine she needs.
Diane is one of the many Wisconsinites I’ve heard from who can’t afford the medicine they’ve relied on for years. She is joining me tomorrow for the State of the Union to highlight the need to lower the costs of prescription drugs. #SOTU2019
I support investing in the dignity of work and Workforce Resource in Menomonie is putting the YouthBuild program to work creating career pathways for young Wisconsinites.
.@CAIRockWalworth helps build better futures for young people and I am proud to support this federal investment in their hard work.
I have seen firsthand how @EmployMilwaukee works every day to help young people complete their education give back to their community. Glad to push for this funding so they can support #WI youth.

People in DC think it's cold.Don't tell that to Wisconsin's Mitch Hansen.Thanks to the Village of Cameron Fire Department and our firefighters for their public
I worked for strong investments in the 2018 #FarmBill to support our hardworking farmers, including @WICornGrowers. I will continue working to make sure Wisconsin farmers have the tools they need to be successful and move #WI forward.
The Marshfield Clinic Health System (@mfldclinic) supports a healthy Wisconsin. I am proud of our continued partnership in making sure Wisconsin families have access to quality health care services. Thanks for the visit this week!
We need to make sure our government is buying American products. My #MadeinAmerica Act will strengthen #BuyAmerica requirements for the federal government so we are supporting American manufacturers and workers.
The Trump Administration is spending billions of taxpayer dollars on infrastructure projects that are not subject to Buy America requirements. The result is American taxpayer money is being spent to buy foreign products and support workers in other countries.
#TBT #BuyAmerica
Two years ago President Trump said he supported my legislation that requires a permanent #BuyAmerica standard for rebuilding our water infrastructure but he has failed to deliver on his promise.
The latest Executive Order from @POTUS is weak, toothless and more proof he is a phony on #BuyAmerica. American manufacturers and workers deserve a permanent #BuyAmerica commitment from Washington that rewards their hard work.
The least we can do is level the playing field and give women a fair shot at getting ahead because they deserve equal pay for equal work. #PaycheckFairness #EqualPay
Many women are working full-time, and many are working two jobs to make ends meet, yet far too many are barely getting by, and far too many women and children are living in poverty. We need to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act and do right by working women.
Working women make up over 50 percent of our workforce. They are working harder than ever to get ahead, and they deserve to get ahead. #PaycheckFairness
There is paycheck inequality for hard working American women across this country and it is time we do something about it. Congress should vote to pass the #PaycheckFairness Act
President Trump, Scott Walker and Foxconn made promises to Wisconsin workers and taxpayers.Foxconn cannot be allowed to fall short of keeping their promises or break
This is long overdue justice for our veterans. Now it is up to @SecWilkie to do the right thing and let this decision stand. Our #BlueWaterNavy veterans have waited long enough.
If my good friend @RepGwenMoore can beat cancer, yes we can stand up against those who want to take people's health care away.Yes we can win our fight to protect people’s health care. Yes we can make sure every American has the guarantee of quality coverage.
I was happy to welcome and meet with members from the Wisconsin Association of School Boards (@WASBWI) today. Thank you to our school board members for your work for Wisconsin schools and students! #NSBAAI19
It’s only fair that if the federal government can charge you interest for being late on your taxes, then it should be paying interest on late paychecks to workers.I’m calling on @SenateMajLdr to bring the Back Pay Fairness Act to the floor for a vote.
Mr. President, global climate change or as you call it “global waming” hasn’t gone anywhere. Please log off twitter take the time to understand this real and growing threat to national security, public health and our economy in the beautiful Midwest.
That’s why I’m joining @SenTinaSmith on her Fair Compensation for Low-Wage Contractor Employees Act and calling for a vote so we can make sure our federal contractor employees get the paychecks they
The #TrumpShutdown accomplished nothing and hurt a lot of people, including federal contractor employees who were furloughed or forced to accept reduced work hours. We need to make sure these contractors who missed their paychecks are paid back.
Federal workers went without pay for over month because of the #TrumpShutdown.The Trump Administration must immediately act to make sure these workers get paid.No delays. Now.
I have always opposed BDS activities and will continue to do so. I support security aid to Israel and Syria sanctions, but #S1 overturns 50 years of bipartisan US policy and threatens a peaceful two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
I’m calling for a Senate vote on the Back Pay Fairness Act. Federal workers haven’t been paid in over a month.They should receive their full back-pay plus any interest accrued.
As heavy snow and dangerously cold weather conditions spread throughout #WI, please use extra caution when deciding to head outdoors today. Make sure to familiarize yourself with weather safety tips, and stay safe!
My thoughts are also with the survivors. My JUST Act was signed into law last year to take an important step toward securing justice for Holocaust survivors and families of victims. #NeverAgain
On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, I join Wisconsin’s Jewish community in remembering and honoring the victims of the Holocaust. #WeRemember #NeverAgain
President Trump's shutdown accomplished nothing and has hurt a lot of people. Now that he has agreed to end it, we can open the government, make sure workers get a paycheck, and work together on bipartisan reform to fund border security and fix our broken immigration system.
Wisconsin Coast Guard workers are risking their lives and doing their job without pay during the #TrumpShutdown.This is a disgrace. We should be doing everything we can to support our Coast Guard service members and their families. We need to #EndTheShutdownNow.
The Earned Income Tax Credit rewards hard work helps grow our economy. Today I introduced a resolution to raise awareness of this tax credit so that #WI workers families can keep more of what they’ve earned.
These are serious grand jury indictments against a longtime advisor to President Trump.  There is a pattern of people close to the President lying to Congress and investigators. If they did nothing wrong, what is everybody trying to hide?
“For us, it’s going to be close to a $20,000 revenue that we’re not going to be able to make up later when and if the government opens... this debate shouldn’t have a financial burden on small businesses, their employees their families.”
“It’s really, really stressful. I have student loans that I can’t pay right now. It’s kind of like a black cloud over you. I’ve been trying to stretch as much of what we have in the pantry and our fridge.” #EndTheShutdownNow
Today in the Senate I voted with Democrats and Republicans for bipartisan legislation that has passed the House to end the #TrumpShutdown, fund the government and make sure workers get their paychecks. We must work together to #EndTheShutdownNow.
Just one reason why I will not support Andrew Wheeler’s nomination. We need leadership at the EPA to take on polluters, confront climate change and protect our environment.
I do and it’s a disgrace that 800,000 workers aren’t getting paid. #EndTheShutdownNow
I support a Senate vote on bipartisan legislation passed by the House to #EndTheShutdownNow. The Senate should pass it and President Trump should sign it to reopen the government.
With severe snowstorms hitting #WI this week let us not forget the homeless. On day 33 of the #TrumpShutdown Wisconsin nonprofits running homelessness prevention programs are facing uncertainty.
Federal workers have to take odd jobs to make ends meet during the #TrumpShutdown. That’s not right. There’s common ground to simply #EndTheShutdownNow by voting to open the government make sure workers get paid. Let's first get the job done on that.
President Trump’s ban on patriotic, qualified Americans who want to serve our country is wrong and this SCOTUS decision shows how far we have to go to achieve full equality for everyone. I stand with transgender servicemembers who fight to protect our democracy and freedoms.
Today, in honor of a great American leader, let us rededicate ourselves to writing a story of progress and creating a future driven by hope - a future where we dream big and lift others up to their dreams. #MLK2019
This #MLKDay I visited with students, faculty and staff at Waukesha County Technical College @Beloit_College. I was so inspired by these young leaders who are working together to move our great state #Forward.
There is common ground in the Senate to #EndTheShutdownNow by voting to open the government, fund Homeland Security and make sure workers get a paycheck. Let's first get the job done on that then work across party lines to pass  comprehensive immigration reform.
Each of the young leaders honored today are fulfilling Dr. King’s promise of doing right by others and serving their community. Congratulations and thanks for what you do! #MLKDay2019
This morning I kicked off #MLKweekend at the Urban League of Greater Madison for their 35th Annual Outstanding Young Person Breakfast with @LGMandelaBarnes and @ULGM President Dr. Ruben Anthony!
RT @MKEBizJournal: Craft brewers taking a hit - @SenatorBaldwin cites @lakefront Brewery on @SenateFloor in call to end shutdown @realDonal…
Tens of thousands of Wisconsinites rely on community health centers to get the care they need. We need to make sure to fully fund community health centers so they can continue to deliver quality, affordable care to Wisconsin families.
Scott Pruitt was a complete failure and I have no confidence Andrew Wheeler will provide the leadership we need at the EPA to take on polluters, confront climate change and protect our environment. More
We need a Senate vote to #EndTheShutdownNow.President Trump needs to agree to sign bipartisan legislation to end his shutdown and reopen the government.Our #MadeinWI craft brewers shouldn’t pay the price for the #TrumpShutdown.
