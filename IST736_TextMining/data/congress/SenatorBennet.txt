President Trump is reducing our national security to a dollar transaction. The presence of our troops stationed outside the U.S. and strong relationships with our allies partners are essential to American power.
As the epicenter of national security space, Colorado is the ideal home for U.S. Space Command to defend against threats. The CO Congressional Delegation, Gov. Polis, I are inviting @ActingSecDef to visit CO and see why:
On #InternationalWomansDay we rededicate ourselves to building a world where my three daughters, and women everywhere, can look down any path and see the doors wide open to their brilliance and talent. #BalanceforBetter #IWD2019
Today, the House passed #ForThePeople Act, the most consequential bill to fix our democracy since I joined Congress. With less money in politics, stronger ethics in DC, more access to the ballot, #HR1 represents a major step forward.  Now, the Senate needs to vote.
In 1965, @repjohnlewis and other brave souls marched across that bridge in Selma to demand justice on the other side. Today, America still has so many bridges left to cross - from ending child poverty to securing the vote. Their example remains an inspiration for the work ahead.
Today, nearly 10 million American children live in poverty. The #AmericanFamilyAct is our way of saying we don’t have to accept that for our country.
When I first read about the recent spike in farm bankruptcies, it came as no surprise. President Trump’s reckless trade and immigration policies have been devastating for farmers in Colorado and across the country. Read my oped in the @WSJ ️
“[T]he odds of a generational reduction in child poverty in America just went way, way up.” #AmericanFamilyAct
Right now, nearly 10 million kids in America are living in poverty. I can think of nothing more at war with who we are as a country than allowing our kids to grow up in poverty. #AmericanFamilyAct
A new report by @CpspPoverty found that our #AmericanFamilyAct would cut child poverty by 38%:
Our #AmericanFamilyAct significantly increases the Child Tax Credit and makes it fully refundable. For a family of four earning $60K/year, that could mean another $3,200 in their paychecks each year.
In every part of my state – from urban to rural, from Republicans to Democrats – I hear the same thing: people working full-time, even overtime, STILL struggle with the costs of raising a family. The #AmericanFamilyAct responds to this challenge.

No one better to have by my side in this effort to protect Colorado’s public lands than these unbelievable athletes. By working with local communities to preserve access to the outdoors in our #COREAct, we’re also boosting the outdoor recreation industry our state’s economy.
As #WomensHistoryMonth begins, join me in celebrating the extraordinary contributions women have made to Colorado and our country – from opening businesses to running for office, and beyond. This month and every month, we continue our fight for progress and equality.
Passing this measure is one of many steps we must take to address this public health threat with the urgency it requires. #PFASMore info here →
It's inexcusable that the Trump admin continues to delay action to address PFAS contamination across the country. We introduced a bill to ensure contaminated sites are cleaned up resources are available to communities in Colorado so they have access to safe drinking water.
Thanks for all you’re doing to give young people the chance to serve our country and maintain our incredible public lands - in Colorado and across the country!
Our farmers and ranchers know full well the cost of this trade war and need this administration to act responsibly. They won’t accept anything less.
Last year, U.S. carbon emissions increased we endured record-breaking drought wildfire across the West. More than ever, we need strong leadership at @EPA to combat climate change protect public health. @EPAAWheeler is not that leader. Full statement:

Heading into the Senate Ag Hearing to question @SecretarySonny on implementing the #FarmBill. From legalizing #hemp to funding drought resilience, we have our work cut out for us. We must ensure the Trump administration stands ready to help Colorado implement the bill.
Agree that the health of our communities is dependent on vibrant local news. We must seek out innovative ways to support invest in local journalism and ensure the next generation understands the critical role it plays in our democracy.
10 years ago today, the Rocky Mountain News published its final edition. I can’t imagine my time at Denver Public Schools without having both the Rocky Denver Post to hold each other to the highest standards push for facts.
We all have a responsibility to do everything we can to protect our environment now and for generations to come. Thank you, @LCVoters. #LCVScorecard
In Colorado, after two of the worst mass shootings in our nation’s history, our legislators rose to the occasion strengthened gun background checks. Today the House joined Colorado, passing a clean bill to #UpdateBackgroundChecks nationwide. The Senate must do the same.
#LWCF has directly benefited communities in our state like Durango. We are now one step away from providing Coloradans the certainty they need to pursue conservation projects that will boost the outdoor economy.
House passage of #LandsPackage2019 moves it to the President's desk. Permanent reauthorization of LWCF will expand ensure access to public lands for future generations.
For years, I worked w/Senator John McCain, who valued service above all else, on the 21st Century Conservation Service Corps. Our bill, headed to @POTUS' desk in #LandsPackage2019, expands opportunities for youth veterans to pursue national service outdoor careers. #21CSC
Now the Senate must pass this disapproval resolution to bring the President’s #FakeTrumpEmergency to an end. This sends a clear message to @realDonaldTrump that he cannot undermine democratic norms to fulfill his campaign promise.
#LandsPackage2019—which includes many bills I’ve long-championed—will ensure access to #publiclands for future generations. After years of working alongside Coloradans to save #LWCF, permanent reauthorization is headed to @POTUS' desk. Now our work for full funding continues.
Yet another example of the Trump Administration undermining women’s health care and the right to choose.
.@realdonaldtrump, nice attempt to move the goal posts back to the 1950s by putting climate deniers on a panel to discredit a fact that your own government has reinforced time and time again: Climate change is a threat to national security.
This is incredibly moving. Thank you, @repjanetbuckner for sharing your story.
Colorado won’t stand for this attack on our Constitution and rule of law. Grateful to @GovofCO and @COAttnyGeneral for joining the lawsuit to block President Trump’s #fakenationalemergency.
Whatever your politics, every American should worry about a President inventing a fake emergency to bypass Congress. This is a dangerous precedent and blatant attack on our democracy and rule of law. #FakeTrumpEmergency
At a time when @POTUS attacks judges, flouts ethical norms, and disparages the Mueller investigation, Mr. Barr’s broad view of executive power and narrow view of obstruction of justice are deeply troubling. That's why I voted against his nomination for Attorney General.
Climate change is a national emergency. So is child poverty. You know what's not, @realDonaldTrump? Your ridiculous campaign promise.
We owe it to the kids in Parkland, and kids across the country, to fight for a country free from gun violence. The time to act is now.
In the year #sinceParkland, nearly 1,200 children have been killed by guns. Yet, tragedy after tragedy, Congress has done nothing.

In the Yampa River Valley, #LWCF helped improve access for anglers to world-class trout waters. My trip there last year—with sportsmen, veterans @COParksWildlife—was telling of the enormous role LWCF plays in their lives.
In the #LandsPackage2019, we made a commitment to future generations to permanently protect their access to public lands across the country. In the last decade, Coloradans have shown me the importance of #LWCF projects in places like Ophir Valley Yampa River. Take a look ️
After working for a decade to #SaveLWCF, tonight the Senate passed permanent reauthorization as part of the #LandsPackage2019. Thank you to everyone who spoke up about this critical program to expand access to the outdoors in Colorado across the country.
Today is a victory for Colorado and a commitment to future generations. #SaveLWCF
� Senate passes #LWCF permanent reauthorization! To everyone who fought to #SaveLWCF, thank you. This is your historic win. After a decade of leading the charge, we’ll make sure this bill makes it across the finish line.
These attacks don’t happen in a vacuum. When you slander journalists as enemies of the people, you give cover to those who seek to commit violence against them. Our nation was founded on the view that journalists should work in freedom, not fear.
To those gathered outside the Capitol today, thanks for raising your voices. We’ll keep fighting to #SaveTPS.
The #LWCF bill passed a procedural step last night, putting us closer to permanently reauthorizing the program. Having worked on this issue since I joined the Senate in 2009, I’m thrilled that we are nearing the finish line.

More evidence that @realDonaldTrump should prioritize #climatechange, not ignore it like he did in the #SOTU. Today @NASA and @NOAA found that 2018 was the fourth hottest year on record.
Every Coloradan, whether they live in a city or the mountains, should have access to affordable, high-quality health care. That's why my #MedicareX plan would roll out first in rural communities. Today I met with @coruralhealth to hear their input on expanding access.
The state I represent is a third republican, a third democratic, and a third independent. Colorado knows what hard, bipartisan work really looks like. We’ll be looking in the days, months, and years ahead to see if any of it can be produced in Washington.
We heard nothing in tonight’s speech that addressed how the President will help raise incomes for middle-class Americans, make quality higher education more affordable, or address the urgent problem of climate change.
It will take more than a speech to paper over President Trump’s consistent view that the only obligation he has is to his political base.
What lines did we miss?
He thinks Democrats have “turned into an angry mob, bent on destroying anything or anyone in their path.”
He has said Democrats are “too dangerous to govern” and have “gone wacko.”
He has called Democrats “totally unhinged” and the “party of crime.”
It will be interesting to hear what @realDonaldTrump comes up with tonight to talk about his commitment to bipartisanship. He should probably not repeat these earlier lines:
The real state of our union includes families concerned about #climatechange, #healthcare, #education more. Here's a roundup of what @POTUS should address tonight:️ “What Coloradans Want to Hear in the State of the
JoBeth J. says, "I want to hear a clear and precise plan to reunite children separated from their parents at the border."
Angela H. wants to know how the Trump administration will #ActOnClimate, asking “What initiatives will we take to reduce greenhouse emissions and commit to renewable, clean energy?”
Carrie H. says “My family is made up of a small business owner, firefighter college student. We work hard want our tax $ spent to improve our CO communities, schools environment. I’m tired of hearing lies stupid rhymes to spend my money on a useless wall.”
Emy K. raised issues we don’t talk about enough: #broadband #mentalhealth.“I'd like to see work on rural broadband access… Funding for mental health, leaving our #PublicLands public no more government shutdowns are important to me.”
We asked, and you answered. Here’s a roundup of some of the responses we received on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram via email. This is what Coloradans believe are the top priorities for tonight’s #SOTU.
Leading a bipartisan group with @SenBillCassidy to draft legislation that eliminates surprise medical bills. In our latest effort, we’re seeking answers from the providers and insurers on their billing practices.
Happy Lunar New Year to all those celebrating today! Hoping the #YearOfThePig brings you happiness, good health, and prosperity.

The photo is racist and despicable. Governor Northam should step down and allow his Lieutenant Governor, Justin Fairfax, to become the next Governor of Virginia.
Amazing way to close out the @OutdoorRetailer show with an @OIA endorsement for our #COREAct. The name of the bill—Colorado Outdoor Recreation Economy Act—says it all. We don’t have to choose between protecting public lands boosting our economy. One leads to the next.

Every day, financial insecurity forces people to leave their jobs because they can’t afford child care, transportation, or an unexpected emergency. My #AmericanFamilyAct would bring much-needed stability to their lives by helping them cover these essentials and continue to work.
For decades, we’ve seen economic growth almost entirely benefit the top 10% of Americans. My #AmericanFamilyAct would address this inequality, providing critical support to low-income middle-class parents who have been left out—ultimately cutting child poverty nearly in half.
Everywhere I go, I meet people who are working hard can’t afford some combination of housing, health care, higher education child care.These aren’t nice-to-haves—they are must haves.My #AmericanFamilyAct w/ @SenSherrodBrown would help change that.

Because the #COREAct is community-driven, it creates new wilderness areas and also preserves outdoor recreation opportunities, so Coloradans can continue to explore the outdoors. Read more about what it means for our state →
More than a decade in the making, I’m excited to announce a bold vision for our state’s public lands: the #COREAct.  Colorado counties, businesses, sportsmen conservationists helped write this bill to protect 400,000 acres of public lands boost our economy for generations.

The shutdown has hit rural communities especially hard in Colorado. Government jobs like @forestservice @USDA are usually reliable. Now workers are left to figure out how to pay the bills.
After legalizing #hemp in the Farm Bill, we should be expanding opportunities for growers. Instead, the #TrumpShutdown has halted implementation increased uncertainty for the industry. With @SenatorTester, calling on @usbr to update its policies:
As farmers ranchers navigate the uncertainty of drought, investing in technology is one of the best ways we can provide more opportunities for success. Congrats to @CUBoulder for securing @ARPAE grant leading the way to develop innovative ag tools.
The Trump administration must make it a top priority to identify and reunify all separated children in their custody. Anything less is unacceptable.

As the shutdown drags on, Colorado breweries like @upslope—which I visited last year—face uncertainty over new beer launches stand to lose thousands in revenue. It’s far past time to reopen the government. Today I called on @USTreasury to take action:
Our outdoor economy and the Coloradans that support it are suffering because of the #TrumpShutdown. How many #ShutdownStories like Bruce’s will it take for @realDonaldTrump to come to his senses and end this shutdown?
Today, we took to the Capitol steps to highlight stories of Americans harmed by the #TrumpShutdown. Bruce, an Estes Park tour guide, has seen disappointed guests cancel their tours. Bruce’s story is like that of thousands of Coloradans who are losing money due to the shutdown.
For the first time, kids fighting cancer will have the same access to innovative drugs as adults. This is one of our greatest achievements from last Congress w/ @marcorubio, @KIDSvCANCER many others. Ready to see it implemented in 2020.
The idea that, in the 21st century, some people are trying to restrict everyone from being counted in the #2020Census is a profound embarrassment to our country. SCOTUS should uphold this decision. 
Over the weekend, our government set a new record.Not for the number of roads repaired or bridges built.Not for higher graduation rates for our kids.Not for passing the most bills or investing in our future.But for the longest shutdown in U.S. history. This is a travesty.
This is the exact opposite of what we heard at @NationalWestern Stock Show. Colorado farmers can’t get @USDA loans are concerned about getting projects up running. @realDonaldTrump can try to spin this all he wants, but our state feels the real burden.

Mr. President, stop playing politics with the livelihoods of 15,700 Coloradans. We must reopen the government.
The #TrumpSpeech tonight showed @realDonaldTrump is willing to go to any length to get his ineffective wall, even at the expense of American workers and families. This shutdown is ridiculous. We must reopen the government.
Why has @realDonaldTrump #shutdown the government? Over a wall he promised Mexico would pay for. Clearly he didn’t fulfill that promise or we wouldn’t be here. He's also lying about the need for this wall, b/c we've offered him $25 billion for border security he turned it down.
The shutdown has now lasted 18 days—the second longest in history—and every day it gets worse. @senatemajldr should bring up the Republican-supported bills that have already passed the House and reopen the government immediately.
The #TrumpShutdown is what happens when you have a President who is willfully indifferent to the struggles of Americans who work for a living. We need to end it
If @realDonaldTrump got up from the Resolute Desk and walked down the hall, his Chief of Staff could explain to him that his views on a wall are “simplistic,” “absurd” and “almost childish.”
Every day the shutdown drags on, the situation in our national parks grows worse. Colorado communities are the ones left paying the price. 
Why do the people of Estes Park have to bear the burden of the stupidity of Washington? Bruce D., who runs a tour company in Rocky Mountain National Park, called my office today to tell us how visitors are cancelling tours and the shutdown is stifling local business.

Our first order of business should be to reopen the government. @senatemajldr should bring the House-passed funding bills—which have Senate Republican support—to the floor for a vote.
“This isn’t a game…We just want to work. We want to pay our bills.”“Don’t use us as leverage to get what you want politically.”  Coloradans need us to reopen the government. This must be our top priority.
Letting politicians choose their voters is antithetical to our democracy. Instead of waiting for SCOTUS, we must pass the #FairMapsAct to ban partisan #gerrymandering enable citizens to regain control of their government.
Months or years? Furloughed workers can’t wait months or years. Farmers ranchers can’t wait months or years. Small business owners can’t wait months or years. Senate Republicans supported 2 House-passed bills to open the government. @senatemajldr should bring them to the floor.
Coloradans are stepping up to fill the void left by @realDonaldTrump’s shutdown. It’s time to reopen the government.
Today, we welcome a Congress that looks more like America than any in our history. The agenda is long and the expectations are high. First priority: Reopening the government. Let’s get to work. #116thCongress
Today marks up to $24 MILLION in lost revenue due to closed national parks in Colorado. @realDonaldTrump's shutdown is causing our state’s outdoor economy to lose $1.9 million per day and withholding pay from more than 7,000 Coloradans. This is unacceptable.
RT @ColoradoSun: In an opinion piece, @SenBennetCO writes: Growing hemp means growing economic opportunity in rural Colorado
Children should never be held in conditions like these. We must change the incentives for those parents who take such enormous risks to escape extraordinary danger in their home countries. We also need an immigration system that reflects our values.
The government is shut down over a “border wall.” Another migrant child died in custody on Christmas. And millions of Dreamers, farmers, business owners are uncertain of their futures. We need a new path forward to reform our immigration system.
Keeping the government open should not depend on the President’s demand for U.S. taxpayers to fund an ineffective and wasteful border wall.  The onus falls on @POTUS to keep the government running, but it’s the American people that will pay the price.
The President is willing and “proud” to shut down the government over an ineffective border wall, and the American people pay the price. We want a secure border. We don’t want @realDonaldTrump’s invented political issue. Full interview with @KatyTurNBC:
We don’t need the nuclear option to secure the border. We need leadership that uses facts to forge consensus.
That $46.3 billion was for agents, technology, 350 miles of fence—what experts agreed was the intelligent way to secure our border. It was double what @realdonaldtrump wants for his ineffective wall. Plus we modernized our visa system created a path to citizenship for 11M ppl
In 2013, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill, with 68 votes, that provided $46.3 billion in border security. People seeking to immigrate legally—not American taxpayers—would have paid for this through new application fees.
His resignation letter is a poignant testament to enduring American values and alliances. We must preserve both.
Throughout his distinguished career, Secretary Mattis served our country honorably. Senators from both sides of the aisle, including myself, took some solace in his presence in the Trump administration.
Today @POTUS signed the five-year #FarmBill we wrote in the Ag Committee to bring certainty to farmers ranchers. We said we’d get this bill done by the end of the year, and thanks to the hard work of Coloradans, we did.
We cannot forget that thousands of migrant children remain in U.S. custody. They fled violence and corruption in their home communities seeking a better life. The administration must move them quickly out of custody and into safe and healthy homes.
Instead of making life harder for families in poverty, how about a work requirement for this president?
Coloradans deserve a Congress responsive to their priorities, but Washington has failed to pass significant public lands legislation for years. We must pass a package that includes #LWCF new wilderness/recreation designations in Colorado, including the San Juan Wilderness bill.
We continue to set a terrible example for how we govern ourselves in a democracy. Our disagreements should not be excuses for gridlock, but invitations to solve problems. That’s the standard set by generations who came before us. We should learn from their example.
A choice between shutting down our government over a border wall or passing another short-term budget is typical Washington.
Every child deserves a healthy start in life, and this law will increase those odds for babies at risk of premature birth. Great working with @SenAlexander to reauthorize #PREEMIEAct provide more research, education treatment to support expectant mothers and their children.
The #FirstStepAct is a principled compromise many years overdue—the first step in a longer effort to reduce mass incarceration and restore faith in our criminal justice system.
Colorado has been asking for the San Juan Wilderness bill for a decade. With end-of-year negotiations underway, now is the time to move it across the finish line.
Glad to see the world is making progress to uphold the Paris Agreement and fight #climatechange, despite efforts from @realDonaldTrump to abandon it.
The ACA is not perfect, but it’s provided healthcare to millions w/ preexisting conditions coverage for essential health benefits. GOP should abandon efforts to attack ACA instead work w/ Dems to fix its flaws so we can provide quality, affordable healthcare to every American
For years, Republicans have tried to dismantle the ACA. After trying failing over 70 times to repeal the bill w/o offering a replacement, GOP added a provision to their disastrous tax bill to sabotage the individual mandate, providing the argument used in the TX court's ruling.
Heartbreaking. @DHSgov must immediately review what happened determine how it could have prevented this tragedy. Border security includes providing agents officers w/ the equipment, resources training they need to both uphold the rule of law treat humans with dignity.
We are living high and mighty in the house but are handing our kids the mortgage. Our parents and grandparents didn’t do that to us, and we shouldn’t do it to the next generation.
We are without a strategy to address the persistent conflict, humanitarian crisis, and threats to U.S. interests in #Yemen. By passing this resolution, we are sending a strong, bipartisan statement that the Trump administration must take the required steps to formulate one.
RT @e2org: Yesterday, Congress passed the 2018 Farm Bill that included an critical new soil health pilot program. Thanks to Sen. @RonWyden…
Congress just sent #2018FarmBill to @POTUS’ desk. Because of Colorado’s input, this bill: - Legalizes #hemp- Strengthens Farm Safety Net- Expands economic opportunity- Addresses #climatechange- Improves forest health- Promotes conservation - Expands access to healthy food
Websites apps that profit from our data should be held accountable for how they use it. Cosponsored #DataCareAct with @brianschatz to ensure internet companies are acting in our best interest.
Following the lead of @SenatorTester, I'm calling on the Senate to extend VA benefits to veterans exposed to toxic chemicals who served in the waters of Vietnam. Veterans come together fight until the job is done. We must follow their example and pass this #BlueWaterNavy bill.
ICYMI: My remarks last night on the #FarmBill. This bipartisan bill looks past politics and provides the tools for farmers ranchers to invest in future generations.
