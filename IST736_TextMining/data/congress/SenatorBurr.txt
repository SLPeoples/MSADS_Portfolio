President Trump was right to walk away from the table in Hanoi. If North Korea wants to discuss sanctions relief, it must be ready to show verifiable progress toward denuclearization and stop its human rights atrocities. Anything less would be a bad deal.
Proud of my staff for participating in this year’s #ACECFC step challenge! Go Team Burr!
On an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of 92-8, the Senate votes to #SaveLWCF. My full statement here:
#LWCF is a program that matters. It makes a difference. And it operates at NO COST to taxpayers. Voting to protect it is the right thing to do. 4/4
I want to thank my colleagues, @SenCoryGardner, @SteveDaines, @SenatorCantwell, @SenatorBennet and many others, who helped lead the charge to #SaveLWCF and to preserve America’s amazing natural treasures. 3/4
Today’s vote has been a long time in the making. We knew three years ago that #LWCF (founded in 1965) would expire in Sept. 2018, but despite strong bipartisan support, Congress was slow to act. I am glad we’re finally fixing that. 2/4
Big News: The Senate is about to vote to #SaveLWCF, America’s most successful conservation program, as part of the #LandsPackage2019. Today’s vote will provide the certainty necessary for #LWCF to carry out important long-term efforts. 1/4
Walter will be remembered as a man of strong principles, willing to take an unpopular stand when necessary. He was a hard-working and faithful public servant, and he will be sorely missed. Our prayers are with his family – may he rest in peace. 2/2
@RepWalterJones and I came to Washington together in 1995. Having worked alongside him for nearly 25 years, I can tell you without hesitation that he left North Carolina, Congress, and our country better places than he found them. 1/2
Saddened to hear of the passing of my friend and former colleague @JohnDingell. John was a true legend in the House, and anyone who worked with him learned a great deal in the process.
Thank you @SecElaineChao @USDOTFRA Administrator Batory for this needed investment in NC’s and America’s infrastructure. These improvements mark the next step toward high-speed rail between Raleigh and Richmond, helping bring our transportation system into the 21st century. 2/2
.@USDOTFRA announced a crucial $10 million grant to @NCDOT yesterday, providing several needed railway upgrades, highway improvements, and traffic alleviation near Raleigh, NC. 1/2
Happy birthday to one of the greatest presidents in our nation’s history, Ronald Reagan!
Our economy is booming, our job market is flourishing, and millions of Americans now get to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks each week. My full statement on tonight’s #SOTU here:
.@NatlParkService announced yesterday that two more North Carolina battlefields will be preserved for future generations thanks to #LWCF. This is yet another example of why we have to #SaveLWCF - so it can continue its important conservation work.
304k more jobs in January with private-sector wages rising 3.2% over the last year, according to @BLS_Gov. Continued growth and success thanks to the #TaxCutsandJobsAct
As #BlackHistoryMonth begins, let’s honor the brave young men whose decision to sit down at the Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, NC inspired a sit-in movement across the South. #OnThisDay in 1960.
Our enemies are going to keep finding new ways of attacking us that exploit the openness of our society, and slip through the seams in a national security architecture designed for the Cold War. We can’t afford to get complacent.Full statement here:
STARTING NOW: #WorldwideThreats hearing at Senate Intel Committee. Tune in live:
Senate Intel’s #WorldwideThreats hearing is an important opportunity for the American people to hear what the intel community is doing to meet the global threats facing our nation. Watch live @ 9:30am ET:
3/These indictments should send a clear message that the U.S. will not tolerate pernicious and illegitimate behavior that threatens our economic and national security.
2/Huawei is a global bad actor operating at the behest of the Chinese government and intelligence services. It seeks to undermine legitimate competition, while subverting laws and democratic institutions.
1/I am encouraged by @TheJusticeDept actions against Huawei, which detail the company’s brazen efforts to steal corporate trade secrets, commit fraud, and obstruct justice.
Reminder ️ Tomorrow @ 9:30am, Senate Intel will hear from @ODNIGov Dan Coats, @FBI Dir. Christopher Wray, @CIA Dir. Gina Haspel and others. Stream it live here: #WorldwideThreats
On #InternationalHolocaustRemembranceDay, we pay tribute to the nearly six million Jews, Poles, Slavs, and others who were tragically murdered out of hate. May God bless their souls, and may we never forget their story.
Senate Intel will hold its annual Worldwide Threats hearing next Tues. @ 9:30 a.m. Heads of @ODNIgov, @FBI, @CIA, @NSAGov among those testifying:

All the way to California, folks in Santa Barbara Co. benefit from #LWCF funding. From their Channel Islands National Park to their Shoreline Park or ball fields and beaches - #LWCF keeps America’s great outdoors available for everyone to enjoy. #SaveLWCF
The @PostandCourier in Charleston, SC makes the important point that projects include “boardwalks on Folly Beach, …the Patriots Point golf course in Mount Pleasant, and Sunrise Park on James Island.” #SaveLWCF
In Nevada, #LWCF programs can range from large projects like the Lake Mead National Recreation Area to the Baily Fishing Pond, as small as one acre, writes a fan in the @RGJ. #SaveLWCF
Folks in Minnesota write in the @DuluthNews that the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness access needs to be preserved, and #LWCF dollars can make that possible. #SaveLWCF
The @BangorDailyNews notes Maine has nearly 740,000 acres maintained by #LWCF’s Forest Legacy program - more than another other state:
In Connecticut, members of the Audubon Society write in the @HartfordCourant about Hammonasset Beach and Bluff Point State Parks made possible by the #LWCF. #SaveLWCF
The Land and Water Conservation Fund is just days from expiring. Newspapers and voters across the country agree: we have to act now to #SaveLWCF. From Maine to Minnesota, Connecticut to California - #LWCF preserves public lands for the public to enjoy.
If you take away one thing about the #LWCF, it should be this: it costs ZERO taxpayer money. #SaveLWCF
I’ll be speaking on the Senate floor this afternoon with Senator @SteveDaines and @SenCoryGardner about the importance of #LWCF. You can watch live here:
My statement on Judge Kavanaugh:
At no cost to the American taxpayer, #LWCF preserves public lands across the country and in nearly every congressional district. This is a no-brainer - we need to renew this vital program before it expires on Sept. 30. #SaveLWCF
Thank you to the incredible men and women of our armed forces who didn't hesitate to come to the aid of their neighbors and friends in #HurricaneFlorence's wake. Without them, the damage and lives lost could’ve been so much worse. @FtBraggNC @Camp_Lejeune

Operating at no cost to the taxpayer, #LWCF is by far our most successful conservation program. Not just because it preserves our beautiful outdoors for the next generation, but because it helps protect our communities today. #SaveLWCF
After #HurricaneSandy, wetlands like the LWCF-funded Cape May National Wildlife Refuge in New Jersey saved an estimated $650 million in damages. #LWCF funds create beautiful spaces that double as critical infrastructure. #SaveLWCF
For instance, the natural green spaces and parks that wind through Charlotte aren't just there for their looks. The Four Mile Creek Greenway also absorbs rain drainage, slowing it down and doubling as a flood control. #SaveLWCF
North Carolinians have more on their minds today than recreation, as we contend with the terrible damage inflicted by #HurricaneFlorence. But #LWCF is critical for building the infrastructure communities need to minimize floods and heavy rains. #SaveLWCF
With just 12 days left before the Land and Water Conservation Fund expires, I am as committed as ever to making sure Congress reauthorizes America's most successful conservation program. #SaveLWCF

The economy grew at 4.2 percent last quarter - the best in nearly four years. There's no doubt that the #TaxCutsandJobsAct continues to benefit millions of Americans and spur economic growth.
I am glad the Senate has finally confirmed Isabel Patelunas as the @USTreasury’s new Asst. Secretary for Intelligence Analysis. As America faces new and growing threats, it is critical that our intelligence positions are fully staffed with capable and qualified public servants.
John will be remembered as he hoped to be remembered: as a man who served his country with honor. Brooke and send our prayers to Cindy and the entire McCain family.
I am deeply saddened by the passing of my friend and colleague, John McCain. John was a true patriot, who placed his duty to his family and his country above all else. He faced this battle with the courage that defined his career and the grace that comes from a life well-lived.
I said I’d go down to the Senate floor every day until Congress acts to #SaveLWCF - and I’m keeping that promise. You can watch live here:
Here’s my promise to my colleagues: I’ll keep demanding a vote on the Senate floor - day after day - until we do what the American people want and #SaveLWCF.
#LWCF has support from Republicans and Democrats, in the Senate and in the House. Americans support the program and want it to continue. Yet for some reason, the Senate still refuses to take up this issue.
Conservation programs, like #LWCF, plan generations ahead and need security to do their work effectively. This solution provides that, while ensuring Congress is still in the driver’s seat.
This bill is a bipartisan compromise. It would permanently reauthorize #LWCF, but give Congress the chance to hold a vote of disapproval every 3 years. If the disapproval vote passes, it ends authorization.
Today, I asked the Senate to take up a bill to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund before it expires next month. #LWCF is critical for preserving our national parks and waters for future generations - and uses NO taxpayer funds.
