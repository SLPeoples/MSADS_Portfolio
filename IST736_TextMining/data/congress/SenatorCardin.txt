How to celebrate #InternationalWomensDay(and every other day):Invest in women.Empower women. Believe women. Listen to women.Stand up for women.Ratify the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.#IWD2019#ERANow
Entire communities suffer when women are not free to earn an income, feed their families, or protect themselves and their children from violence. Until we break down barriers that limit ALL women from reaching economic social equality, we have yet to see our true potential.
How a country treats women is a barometer of its success. When women are empowered, our society prospers. #InternationalWomensDay

We secured a promise of backpay but that didn’t pay the rent or the grocery bill or put gas in your car during the 35-day shutdown. The harm to those who had to work without pay and those locked out of work were very real.
You have a strong, committed delegation working to support @NASAGoddard  #TeamMaryland
We are looking at ways to avoid future shutdowns. We want to make sure federal agencies get the resources they need to meet their priorities.

We are hearing from #SmallBusiness that the “partial” govt shutdown is having an affect far and wide. Permits and licenses are not being processed. Loans are being approved but sit unfunded. Access to capital is essential for small biz survival, but that is being choked.

FACT: In the first half of FY ’18, Customs Border Protection apprehended only 6 individuals AT THE BORDER whose names were on a terrorist screening list. The @WhiteHouse has offered no evidence to the contrary.
At no point did @realDonaldTrump address why we can’t reopen parts of the Gov’t that have nothing to do with border security. Why is he holding @StateDept @DOJ @CommerceGov @USDOT @NatlParkService and all the Americans they serve hostage? #EndTheShutdown

The Senate should not take up any bills unrelated to reopening the government until @SenateMajLdr lets us vote on exactly that.This is not business as usual. This is a crisis and a failure to govern. Dozens of govt agencies are shut down. We must reconcile that first. #Shutdown
Our dedicated federal workers aren't pawns. They shouldn't have to wonder when their next paycheck may come just because @realDonaldTrump thinks a wall is a substitute for immigration reform. So this week, my colleagues and I introduced legislation that would guarantee back pay.
Agreed. This isn’t business as usual. This is a crisis, a fundamental failure to govern, and Americans are suffering for it. The Senate should not take up any bills unrelated to reopening the government until @SenateMajLdr lets us vote on exactly that. #Shutdown
Right now:-420,000 federal workers, like Coast Guard and DEA agents, are being forced to work without pay.-380,000, such as Forest Service firefighters, have been furloughed.@ChrisVanHollen and I are leading the charge to right these wrongs and ensure they get paid. #Shutdown
Day 15 of the #TrumpShutdown.While @POTUS holds the govt hostage over a wall, federal workers suffer. These are members of the Coast Guard, law enforcement officers, NASA employees. And right now, they can't afford their bills. That's shameful. I've introduced a bill to help.
Remember: the bill @SpeakerPelosi has put forth to reopen the govt is something both Dems *and* Republicans agreed to just a couple months ago, before @POTUS threw a tantrum.Time to end the theatrics. We're ready to govern. @POTUS is the only one who's not. #GovernmentShutdown

... these are workers who mostly are on the job 24/7, 365 days a year. Holiday or no holiday. The difference this year, thanks to President Trump, is that they won’t know when their next pay check will come. The Senate passed a clean Continuing Resolution. The House should too.
@justinlkurth Yes! Over 30 percent of federal workers are veterans. The percentage continues to increase year after year.
@BannockCreek121 That is exactly what this bill does. S. 861 - The Federal Employee Fair Treatment Act.
I’m thankful that the Senate passed unanimously my bill, with @ChrisVanHollen and over 30 cosponsors, to protect federal workers nationwide so they know they will get paid (eventually) even if the President forces a shutdown. I urge the House to pass it quickly.
These are federal law enforcement and correctional workers from ATF, Bureau of Prisons, FBI, US Marshals, DEA. Forest Service firefighters and even weather forecasters. More than 380,000 public servants will be furloughed - NASA, Nat’l Parks, HUD, DOT and others.
There is no such thing as a ‘good’ shutdown. Even a partial shutdown costs taxpayers money. It inconveniences the public. And its certainly not fair to the federal public servants who would be directly affected.  More than 420,000 will be working without pay ...
Sincerely appreciate the efforts of @Ravens players to engage in the push for criminal justice reform. By working together, we have won a major bipartisan victory with the First Step Act, which was signed into law today.
We’re on dangerous ground. The Senate will soon be tasked with confirming a new Secretary of Defense — a responsibility that now demands an unparalleled level of seriousness.
Secretary #Mattis’ resignation signals a crisis.@POTUS is conducting reckless, incoherent foreign policy. He is ignoring the advice of advisors and our military. He is alienating our allies. And he articulates no plan or explanation beyond what he can fit in a wayward tweet.
Let's be clear about what this means. Though both parties reached an agreement, @realDonaldTrump would rather block funding for:-Homeland Security-ATF, TSA and Border Patrol-Opioid epidemic response-Disaster reliefOver a costly, ineffective wall. #ArtOfTheDeal?
This is no way to govern.

This is devastating. My heart is broken for this young girl and her family. I expect an immediate and complete investigation into precisely how and why this happened in U.S. Border Patrol

Mr. President… that's not how any of this works. And I believe you know it. Stop lying to the American people about your border wall just because no one wants to waste taxpayer dollars on something that just won't work. #TrumpShutdown

Proud to shut down the government? Proud to put thousands of federal workers' and law enforcement officials' paychecks at risk during the holidays? Proud to close dozens of federal agencies? This president either doesn’t understand what’s at stake, or doesn’t care. #TrumpShutdown
.@realDonaldTrump wants a shutdown. Why? Over a wall that won't fix our immigration issues.We can find common ground on border security and comprehensive reform. The Senate previously passed a bipartisan package. Holding the federal govt hostage isn't the answer. #TrumpShutdown

.@TIME got it right. The free press truly are The Guardians of a free society. They report unpopular news, expose inconvenient facts, speak truth to power.This year in particular, I cannot imagine a more worthy recognition – or journalists more deserving of it than @CapGazNews.
"At other critical moments in our history, when constitutional crises have threatened our foundations, it has been the Senate that has stood in defense of our democracy. Today is once again such a
RT @presidentloh: Congrats to @MarylandMSoccer and Coach @SashoCirovski! You make all Terps so proud!!
70 years ago today, shocked by the horrors of the Holocaust, the world recognized genocide as an international crime and established the #GenocideConvention. Because "never again" isn't a catchphrase; it’s a promise. America must always defend those who cannot defend themselves.
Maryland, don't forget #OpenEnrollment is happening now – and ends next Saturday.This weekend, @MarylandConnect is hosting #LastChance events across the state, where you can go and receive free, in-person help signing up for a 2019 #healthcare plan:
Intimidation of U.S. diplomats is always unacceptable. The use of U.S. supplied equipment to do so is an added affront. I fully support @RepEliotEngel's call to withhold the transfer of additional military-style equipment to #Guatemala until we address the August 31 incident.
Interesting discussion today with the dynamic team at Cornerstone Montgomery, the county's largest provider of behavioral health services. Learning about their remarkable progress in battling #OpioidEpidemic and finding well-paying, lasting jobs for their patients. Great work!
The anniversary of Pearl Harbor reminds us that America has always been a nation that turns anger into action, tragedy into triumph. Today we celebrate that, we honor our veterans, we recommit ourselves to using our strength to defend those who are unable to defend themselves.
The Trump Admin wants to bury the National Climate Assessment report because it doesn't align with @POTUS' completely unhinged claim that #ClimateChange is a "hoax."But ignoring facts never succeeds in making them any less true. And we can't afford to ignore them any longer.
Had a frank conversation w/ the University System of Maryland Board of Regents tonight. They know they made mistakes in their recommendation to retain former Coach Durkin. Now we’re here to move forward and work to address Title IX issues and the rise of hate across USM schools.
Live now, #TeamMaryland provides a read out of our frank discussions w/University Systems of Maryland Board of Regen

Our national security is harmed, not helped, when dictators believe they can get away with heinous acts like extrajudicial killings – and continue to be supported by the U.S. My friends on both sides of the aisle understand this. @POTUS is the only one who doesn’t. #Khashoggi
