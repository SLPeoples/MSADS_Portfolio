On this #InternationalWomensDay, I join Delawareans and Americans across the country in celebrating the tremendous achievements of women around the world. In Congress, I'm honored to serve alongside so many strong women who are fighting for change and inspiring future generations
Does @SenateGOP plan to “innovate” their way out of our climate crisis by supporting @realdonaldtrump’s 70% cut to renewable energy research? Actions speak louder than words – and we need action now.
Proud that #HR1 includes my bill with @SenWarren and @RepCummings that would require presidential candidates — regardless of political party — to address any ethical issues before they take the oath of office.That's not a partisan issue; it's key for a healthy democracy.
Your tax dollars shouldn't be funding climate denial spectacles - especially when our national security is at stake.More on my bill with @SenSchumer and @SenJackReed:
Today’s @Equifax hearing is a reminder that cyberattacks are a huge problem and they aren’t going away. We need to find common ground and put in place nationwide standards in order to adequately protect consumers. We owe it to the American people.
I often say leaders focus on excellence in everything they do, and these Delaware high school seniors and #USSYP2019 delegates are no exception.  Garrett and Andrew – I’m confident you'll continue making the First State proud on your path to public service!
Getting ready to join @VelshiRuhle to discuss my bipartisan report on @Equifax’s inadequate cyber security practices, which led to a cyberattack that compromised sensitive information of more than 145 million Americans.
Both private and public entities should feel a sense of urgency to bolster their cyber defenses. Congress, the Administration, and American businesses need to work together to put in place nationwide cybersecurity standards to protect consumers.
It’s my hope that, by shedding light on @Equifax’s cybersecurity failures that led to this devastating data breach, other U.S. companies can avoid similar breaches that leave millions of American households exposed to hackers.
.@Equifax’s two largest competitors – @TransUnion and @Experian – received the same information about potential vulnerabilities, took proper steps to secure their systems and, to date, have avoided a breach.
In 2015, @Equifax learned it had thousands of cyber vulnerabilities, but did not address those known security issues. Unsurprisingly, in 2017, @Equifax experienced a massive breach that exposed the sensitive data over 145 million Americans.
You would think that protecting the sensitive information its entire business relies on would be @Equifax’s top priority. Yet my report with @senrobportman illustrates years-long neglect of basic cybersecurity practices.
If someone shops regularly at a retail chain that gets hacked, that person can opt not to shop there any longer if doing so makes them uncomfortable. They cannot, however, keep their information away from @Equifax.
When hackers obtain someone's person information, the consequences are real. The constant stream of data breaches we see year in and year out are a sign to me that we could and should be doing a lot better. That is certainly the case with @Equifax.
WATCH LIVE: My report with @senrobportman revealed that @Equifax neglected cybersecurity and ignored vulnerabilities, which led to a cyberattack that compromised sensitive data of 145 million Americans. Today, @Equifax will provide answers to Congress.
Tomorrow, I will join my colleagues on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to hear directly from @Equifax. We owe it to American consumers to begin restoring their confidence in the ability of institutions to protect their information. Watch live:
It is my hope that, by shedding light on @Equifax’s inadequate cybersecurity practices that led to this devastating data breach, other U.S. companies can avoid similarly devastating breaches that leave millions of American households exposed to hackers.
What’s more, the public, including the victims of this massive breach, may never get the full story since @Equifax officials failed to preserve key internal records during and after the breach.
We found that @Equifax’s breach could have been minimized, if not avoided. It’s largest competitors – @TransUnion and @Experian – received the same information about potential vulnerabilities, took proper steps to secure their systems and, to date, have avoided a breach.
REPORT: Over a 17-month investigation, @senrobportman and I found that for years, @Equifax neglected cybersecurity and ignored vulnerabilities, which led to a massive cyberattack that compromised the sensitive information of more than 145 million Americans
EPA’s answer? Roll back the standards that got us here.
Today, I sat down with @DEArtsAlliance to talk about the important role arts play in the First State. From generating nearly $150 million in annual economic activity to advancing creativity, there is no shortage of benefits arts education provides to Delawareans
This proposed panel would be nothing more than a PR stunt to undermine settled #climate science. 58 former generals, admirals and defense officials are telling @realdonaldtrump: keep politics out of our national security approach to #climatechange.
It was great to speak with the men and women of @FedAmerHospital today to talk about ways we can work together to improve the quality of our health care system, curb health care costs, and ensure that more Americans and their families have access to affordable health care.
Working to form a “more perfect union” is a never-ending exercise. While we’ve made important progress, it’s up to each and every one of us to keep fighting for true equality and justice for every American.
Over the past month, families in Delaware and across the US celebrated and reflected on the tremendous achievements of African Americans and contributions they continue to make to shape and enrich our country. But this celebration should continue all year long #BlackHistoryMonth
And with 29 Senators and 182 Representatives on board, we're making progress. The Washington, D.C. Admission Act would give 700,000 DC residents full representation in Congress and lay the ground work for establishing the 51st state. More on my bill here:
DC residents serve in our military, own businesses and pay federal taxes just like their fellow Americans across the U.S. -- yet they lack full voting representation in Congress. That's just not right. Today, I am proud to reintroduce a #statehood bill that would right that wrong
���
Thanks, Colleen, for working hard to #StepUpTheFight! I'm proud to team up with advocates like you at @ONEinAmerica so we can combat these global health issues and humanitarian crises together.
Couldn’t be prouder to earn a 100% rating from @LCVoters. I’ll keep working hard for clean air and water, and leaving a healthy planet for future generations. My next step? Leading @SenateDems to fight against the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be @EPA administrator.
…And that’s just in 7 months at the helm. Plain and simple: @EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler is a threat to the #climatechange movement. And now that a vote for his nomination is scheduled on the Senate floor, I hope my colleagues will join me in raising the alarm.
And after experts at @EPA helped produce this report, Acting Administrator Wheeler tried to downplay it and wrongly suggested that Obama political appointees were to blame for its dire
As @EPA Acting Administrator, Andrew Wheeler is standing in the way of Senate ratification of the #Kigali Amendment that would drive down emissions of a potent #GHG while creating tens of thousands of American

THREAD: In an important moment for our fight against #climatechange, the Senate is about to vote on @realDonaldTrump's pick to lead @EPA, Andrew Wheeler. Piece by piece, Mr. Wheeler has made it his mission to roll back American #climate progress. Here are the biggest examples:
RT @EPWDems: From Colorado to Maine, here's what concerned citizens are saying about the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to lead @EPA
When it comes to #climate action, the difference couldn’t be any more clear. Republicans want to pass the buck and run away from it. We Democrats, on the other hand, accept the reality and choose to confront it head-on.
Thank you, Niel, for your work with @AANMember advocating for lower drug prices to protect patients’ access to care and crucial medical research funding for neurological research!
Great question to pharmaceutical CEOs by my colleague, @SenatorMenendez in today’s @SenateFinance hearing on skyrocketing drug prices: “Did any of you use your tax breaks to lower the costs of any of your prescription drugs?”  You guessed it, the answer was “NO.” #TrumpTaxScam
RT @AmDiabetesAssn: During the hearing, @SenatorCarper asked the CEOs if they would support increasing transparency industry wide to lower…
It’s why in today’s @SenateFinance hearing, I asked CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies to commit to taking much-needed steps to make drug pricing more transparent and to work with Congress on real solutions.
Families being able to afford life-saving medications a loved one needs is a personal issue and one that most Americans can relate to. Over the years, I’ve heard from thousands of Delawareans who simply cannot afford the medicine they need. In America, we can and must do better.
TUNE IN: In 2016, total prescription drug spending in the United States reached $328.6 billion – more than double what Americans spent in 2002. Soon, I’ll ask drug pharmaceutical CEOs how we got here. We must do better for American patients.
I would urge everyone – no matter how you feel about this issue – to read some of the real and heart wrenching stories of families faced with an impossible decision and why they are speaking out:
Women do not have later-term abortions because a pregnancy is suddenly ‘inconvenient.’ The real reasons are agonizing and incredibly personal. We shouldn’t make that decision even more excruciating for parents by getting in between a woman and her doctor. #ProtectProviders
RT @SenWhitehouse: Good article by @eilperin on the fossil fuel lawyers who helped reverse @EPA’s position in a major enforcement action to…
Even though Scott Pruitt was still in charge at the time, there was and remains a basic rule: Federal employees cannot participate in particular matters that involve former clients or employers. @SenWhitehouse, @FrankPallone and I are asking @EPAoig to investigate:
Bill Wehrum wasted no time. It appears it took just weeks for Mr. Wehrum to assist a former client by helping to produce a pro-@DTE_Energy memo for their case in front of the Supreme Court. Yes – the Supreme Court. 
Americans don’t need a new panel to tell us that this White House denies the reality of climate change. No news here.
This is yet another senseless attempt by the Trump Administration to try to limit Americans’ access to health care and erode women’s ability to seek critical medical services. Together, we must fight back against this rule that threatens care for thousands of Delawareans.
Thanks for joining this important trip, @RepDonBeyer. Together, we will keep pushing for comprehensive solutions to address the root causes of irregular migration from the #NorthernTriangle to our Southern border.

This administration’s negotiations with California over #fueleconomy and emissions standards have been superficial and scant at best, or designed to fail at worst.My full statement:
Repeatedly, this administration has snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. This time, it could weaken our automakers’ global competitiveness, and needlessly lead to more pollution that fuels #climatechange.
Tonight's the night!  If you or someone you know is interested in serving their country, getting an excellent education and gaining valuable leadership skills, join me tonight for Service Academy Information Night at @DelawareTech
This new train station will provide passengers and their families with a safe, convenient travel option and help revitalize Claymont. A win-win!
Strong infrastructure is the backbone of a strong economy. This morning I joined @JohnCarneyDE, @RepLBR and @DelawareDOT to announce the Claymont Regional Transportation Center set to begin this spring.
Serving in the @USNavy taught me how to be clear-eyed in assessing risks to American security.  This selection makes a mockery of a serious issue: As stated by intelligence and military leaders, #climatechange poses serious threats to military readiness and national defense.

We had a great meeting with El Salvador’s President @sanchezceren to talk about ways we can continue to work together to foster economic growth and opportunity for all Salvadorans.
Met with @nayibbukele, who left a favorable impression on me. He's inspired young Salvadorans who want the chance to lead prosperous lives in El Salvador. He seems to understand economic development and it's my hope that he can translate his dynamic campaign into concrete actions
We visited @ParqueCuscatlan – a park in San Salvador that is being revitalized as part of a @USAID project to ensure long-term sustainability. Once it's finished, it will offer one of the first safe outdoor public spaces for families and help restore the city’s social fabric.
Creating economic opportunity in the Northern Triangle countries is one of the goals of U.S. support for the Alliance for Prosperity. By preparing Salvadoran youth for the workforce, the center serves as a working example of how we can address some of the root causes of migration
We visited the Bridges to Employment Center, a @USAID project that prepares at-risk Salvadoran youth living in cities with high crime rates, for the workforce. Ensuring young people have the skills they need to be productive citizens could boost El Salvador’s economy.
It’s been a great long weekend in Central America! To end our trip, @SenJeffMerkley, @RepLBR, @DonaldNorcross, @RepDonBeyer, @RepLouCorrea and I flew to El Salvador to meet with government officials and hear from Salvadorans about their hopes and dreams for their vibrant country.
Had a great discussion with the Attorney General of Honduras and other law enforcement leaders in the country on ways to combat illicit trafficking and criminal gangs, reduce corruption and impunity, and strengthen democratic governance and the rule of law in Honduras.
Met with Honduras’ President Juan Orlando Hernandez who is committed to strengthening the rule of law and creating economic opportunity for all Hondurans. It’s imperative that the United States does its part to help by investing in the Alliance for Prosperity.
One of the brightest spots in my trip was having the opportunity to talk with the people of Guatemala and hear their stories. These stories remind me why it’s so important for the U.S. to do it’s part to ensure this beautiful country has the tools it needs to restore democracy.
In Delaware, we know that small businesses are the backbone of our economy. It was great to hear from business leaders in Guatemala who are committed to bolstering their economy. By creating economic opportunity, fewer citizens will be forced to flee in search of a better future.
We also visited with @PRONACOMGT and discussed the importance of current initiatives being implemented under the Alliance for Prosperity to bolster security and economic opportunity in Guatemala and improve the prospects for all citizens.
Had an informative meeting with Guatemala’s Attorney General Consuela Porras and Special Prosecutor Francisco Sandoval on why it’s so important to the structural integrity of a democracy to support the rule of law. Together, we can and must stand up to fight against corruption.
We pressed President Morales to recommit to fostering economic growth; investing in education and workforce development; upholding the rule of law; and rebuilding citizens’ trust in the government by increasing transparency.
My colleagues and I met with Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales to urge him to pursue policies that protect human rights, strengthen accountability, and uphold democratic institutions.
The good news? We know what works. We need to tackle the root causes of migration from Central American countries, not merely the symptoms at our border. We must address the violence and humanitarian crisis in the Northern Triangle forcing families to seek refuge in the U.S.
Just yesterday, President Trump declared a national emergency for his manufactured crisis at the U.S. Southern border. But if President Trump wants to actually get serious about addressing migration, then we need long-term and comprehensive solutions.
At a time when immigration and border security talks are heightened, it’s important to learn more about the places that the migrants arriving at our U.S. Southern border are coming from. And that’s what we’re here to do.
Unfortunately, many Guatemalans seek to flee their homes and make the dangerous journey to the U.S. due to violence, poverty, and lack of rule of law in their country.
Yesterday, @SenJeffMerkley, @RepLBR, @DonBeyerVA, @RepLouCorrea, @DonaldNorcross and I touched down in the beautiful country of Guatemala.
Declaring a #NationalEmergency over the President’s manufactured crisis at the U.S. Southern border sets a dangerous precedent. But don’t take it from me, take it from my Republican colleagues.
While this isn't my ideal bill, I know that responsible governing requires compromise. This bill finds areas of compromise on policy matters without sacrificing our principles. I'm hopeful @POTUS recognizes this as a good deal for the American people and signs it into law quickly
This bipartisan package also includes significant funding for continued humanitarian aid to Central American countries plagued by extreme violence, poverty, corruption and lack of economic opportunity, forcing many to flee and arrive at our southern border in search of safety
It also provides more resources to address the vulnerabilities at our international mail facilities which are exploited by drug traffickers and allow deadly opioids to get into our country — an issue @robportman and I have been working to
This package includes key bipartisan provisions that will fund programs millions of Americans rely on while avoiding another costly shutdown. It makes responsible investments to secure our border in smart ways and provides the funding @CBP actually needs
As someone who has seen many compromises hammered out in Congress and in Delaware, I know that when both sides leave feeling like they didn’t get everything they wanted, you likely have a good deal. This isn’t the bill that I would’ve written, but that’s the nature of compromise
Things that warrant a #NationalEmergency declaration: The attack on Pearl Harbor; the 9/11 terrorist attacks; Hurricane Katrina. Things that DO NOT warrant a #NationalEmergency declaration: Not getting your way in a democracy.
One year ago, 17 innocent students and teachers were murdered in their classrooms. Today, the #ParklandShooting survivors are leading the call for common sense reforms to prevent more senseless tragedies – and I stand with them. Enough is enough. It’s long past time for action.
Today the @TVANews board listened to experts and acted in the best interests of ratepayers and public health. The decision wasn’t based on politics or on tweets from @realdonaldtrump. It was based on economics, science and adherence to TVA’s mission.
I’ve heard it said that “love is a verb.” On this Valentine's Day, it appears my Republican colleagues still love to deny climate change.

So, about this:  Tomorrow the @TVAnews board should do right by ratepayers, not Bob Murray.  Keeping uneconomical coal plants operational at the expense of customers and public health doesn’t make sense. I asked TVA today about these crucial decisions:
President Trump views the Attorney General not as a lawyer to defend the rights of all Americans, but as a “fixer” who should look out for his interests.I don't think it's a coincidence that Mr. Barr has said he will not recuse himself from the Mueller investigation.

In Delaware, 58% of working people can't take unpaid leave and are forced to make an impossible choice: keep their job or grow their family. It shouldn’t be that way, and that’s why I’m proud to support the #FAMILYAct – a bill that guarantees national paid leave.
Today, I met Jillian, a fellow runner and #InclusiveHealth advocate, who is working with @SODelaware to educate, empower and build inclusive communities across the country. Listen to her inspiring story here --&gt;

If you won’t take my word for it, listen to George W. Bush’s @EPA administrator, @GovCTW: Science denial and inaction on #climatechange will only hold back American innovation and cost us dearly in the long-term
Happy birthday to my friend and colleague, @RepLBR! Over the years, Lisa has called me a mentor. But the truth is that we’ve mentored each other. She has the heart of a servant, and we’re so lucky to call her our congresswoman.
Some of the lowlights from @EPA’s 2018 figures: ️Least civil penalties against polluters since 1994️ Inspection rates at half the amount of 2010️ Least civil cases started and completed in 10 years️ Least criminal defendants charged since 1991
These numbers released by @EPA prove just how dedicated @realdonaldtrump is to letting pollution go unanswered. It’s not just the barrage of deregulation – it’s the failure of EPA to meet its most basic obligations
A powerful and important last reflection by my friend and former colleague, @JohnDingell. A must read.
Pleased to join @ChrisCoons and @RepLBR to announce that $8.2 million has been awarded to the First State.  By addressing the root causes of homelessness and giving people the tools to transition to more stable living situations, we can help Delawareans create a brighter future
And I’ll always treasure the times we had together — in Washington and Detroit. He was one for the ages, and he will be dearly missed.
It was @JohnDingell — who I had the pleasure of serving with and who will always be the Chairman to me — who made it clear to me that we can and should fight for win-wins. That we can do right by our one and only planet, while also creating and preserving American jobs.
My heart breaks for @RepDebDingell and all who knew and loved @JohnDingell. Together, we will remember him for his kindness, wit, and courageous leadership in Congress.
That's why I've worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle -- @RonJohnsonWI, @SenGaryPeters and @SenatorBraun -- to introduce legislation designed to cut down on waste and improper payments made by the federal government
As government officials, we have a responsibility to be good stewards of taxpayer dollars, yet, year after year, the federal government continues to mismanage billions of dollars through improper payments.  We can, and must, do better.

There are millions of immigrants in our country, just like Mr. Aguiñaga, who have fled crime, poverty, violence and political unrest and who are simply seeking a better life for themselves and their families. What’s more, they are here helping to make our communities stronger.
Over the last two months especially, there has been a great deal of discussion about border security and immigration reforms. Too often, though, both sides go back and forth arguing over specific policy points and lose sight of the very real people at the heart of this debate.

.@realDonaldTrump is holding the government hostage in the name of national security. But in reality, his own shutdown is putting the nation’s security at risk. Take it from @FBI agents in the field:
Attention Delaware: Today, @Philabundance, @CampbellSoupCo and @PepperidgeFarm will host a food market in Philadelphia for those affected by the #TrumpShutdown.I'm encouraged to see businesses stepping up in a big way to lend a hand during this senseless shutdown.

At today’s Alpha Phi Alpha’s 36th Annual Prayer Breakfast, we are reminded that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. showed us that one person has the power to make a profound difference in our community, in our city, in our country.
Today, families in Delaware and across the country will come together to celebrate the remarkable life and work of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and remember his important message to America: “The time is always right to do what is right.”
These are some of the common sense ideas that I believe both my Democratic and Republican colleagues stand ready and willing to discuss further, @realDonaldTrump, as soon as our government is open for business.
And, just last week, even @USChamber acknowledged that the way to seriously address migration to our border is to provide aid to the Northern Triangle countries in Central America — Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador — and fully fund the Alliance for Prosperity.
There has already been unanimous agreement in the Senate about providing funding for important border security. There is also bipartisan agreement about providing permanent protections and a pathway to legal status for Dreamers and Temporary Protected Status recipients.
Many of my colleagues and I have been steeped in these issues for years. We know the ins and outs and have had success finding areas of agreement in the past. We can do it again. But we cannot hold federal workers, their families and their paychecks hostage in the meantime.
.@realDonaldTrump there is one way to end this shutdown: re-open the government. Once that happens, we can have serious and substantive discussions about securing our borders and fixing our broken immigration system.
On emergencies at Superfund sites, EPA says: "...we may be limited in our ability to provide a substantive response depending on the issue involved"Day after day, the #TrumpShutdown continues to threaten public health and our environment. 
A deeply troubling report that Congress needs answers to. It follows my investigation with @senrobportman that revealed @HHSGov fails to protect children separated from their families. The Trump administration must do
Delaware doesn’t have the luxury of waiting around to fight #climatechange. But yesterday, on a scale of 1-10, Andrew Wheeler showed zero urgency to combat the problem. 
A devastating look into how the #TrumpShutdown is hurting our kids. The President of the United States cannot continue to hold Americans’ pay hostage over a policy difference. Re-open the government. Pay workers. And then let’s have a real debate about border security.
Pictured here is Chris and his son Oliver. Chris is a soybean farmer in Delaware who cannot access the @USDA funds he needs to buy seeds and equipment to prepare for next season. This is one of many families that are the unfortunate collateral damage of the #TrumpShutdown.
Almost every decision to date would suggest otherwise.Actions speak louder than words, Mr. Wheeler.

Just a month ago, I visited with service members at the Indian River Inlet Coast Guard Station in Rehoboth. Today, I can’t believe they are working to keep us safe without pay. The President must end this unnecessary #TrumpShutdown NOW.
This is wholly unfair and unnecessary. The brave men and women of @USCG and their families should not be the collateral damage of the #TrumpShutdown.
Small businesses that make up the backbone of our economy already face unique challenges. The unnecessary #TrumpShutdown shouldn’t be another

I agree. This hearing can wait. With 95% of its workforce on furlough under the #TrumpShutdown, @EPA should focus its scarce resources toward enforcing environmental protections—not toward preparations for the Acting Administrator’s nomination hearing.

After Scott Pruitt's destructive tenure, I urged Andrew Wheeler to right the ship at @EPA. But on issue after issue, he has kept the agency hurdling down a dangerous path, putting public health at risk. Must-read op-ed from @CleanAirMoms' @DmnqBrowning:
The #TrumpShutdown is hurting Delaware’s families, businesses, and our economy and the President must end it now. Read my op-Ed with @ChrisCoons and @RepLBR:

The #TrumpShutdown has all but closed the Philadelphia @EPA office charged with keeping Delaware families safe from toxic air and water pollution. The president’s tantrum is creating real dangers to public health, and it’s only getting

The #TrumpShutdown has hindered farmers in Delaware like Magee and Chris from receiving vital @USDA farm subsidies they need to run their business. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to end this now.

Andrew Wheeler already oversees the agency. Rushing this nomination process while @EPA is shut down is unnecessary and irresponsible. Read our letter to the Acting Administrator here:
President of @FBI Agents Association warns the #TrumpShutdown is "uncharted territory, as this shutdown is going to be the longest in history. For special agents, financial security is national security.” @realDonaldTrump, the nation's safety is at risk -- end the shutdown now.
With the agency’s doors shuttered, @EPA is directing some of its few employees to prepare the Acting Administrator for a confirmation hearing instead of monitoring Superfund sites, cleaning up spills, evaluating chemical safety and protecting air and water
.@realDonaldTrump has created his own narrative to suit his political purposes. For the rest of us, facts still matter. And we cannot discuss his trip to the border today without highlighting the truth about border security.
If @realDonaldTrump was truly interested in a solution, he would fund the Alliance for Prosperity which helps to create economic growth and opportunities in Central America so that families don’t have to flee their homeland in search of safety
Shamefully, we’ve focused more on ways to keep migrants out of our country rather than helping them address the misery in their homelands – misery we’ve helped create and are complicit in due to our appetite for illegal drugs
The Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras are some of the most dangerous in the world. I've seen firsthand the conditions that force so many to flee for their lives. Instead of a photo-op, @realDonaldTrump should be going to Central America.
FACT #11 (and the most important one): The overwhelming majority of migrants arriving at our southern border are not criminals trying to evade border patrol officers. They are families fleeing unspeakable violence in Central America who are surrendering and asking for help.
As my friend @LeaderHoyer rightly pointed out, Republicans who are knowledgeable about border security have repeatedly acknowledged that a physical barrier is not an effective or cost-efficient solution
FACT #10: The notion that a wall is not a smart investment is not just a position held by Democrats and those who work along our border every single day. Republicans think so, too.
.@USCG provides helicopters, aircraft, and fast boats for our border that are vital to interdicting drugs headed for our communities. @TSA deploys agents to patrol airports and mass transit hubs for suspicious activity, looking to prevent attacks. They are crucial to our security
