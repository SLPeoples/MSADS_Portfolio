Sorry to hear that @sbstarherald publisher Roger Tollefson passed away unexpectedly this week. My condolences to his family and the community of Scottsbluff on this difficult loss.
I intend to pursue legislative options to address abuse in the small refinery exemption process. I will also push new leadership at the @EPA to make sure the agency is upholding the RFS as intended by
The EPA gave "hardship exemptions" to profitable refineries, releasing them from their biofuel blending obligations. According to projections, this could cause the ethanol industry to lose billions of gallons in demand.
I am angry by reports that show what we long suspected: former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt ignored the law to help big refineries at the expense of farmers and ethanol producers.

#Russia and #China are building up their nuclear forces; unilaterally cutting our deterrent ignores this reality. It is not the answer. More:
Just last week, @US_Stratcom Commander General Hyten testified that our nuclear forces represent the bare minimum required to protect the United States.
Both the Obama and @realdonaldtrump administrations agree on the value of the triad, as has every administration since the Eisenhower-era. The testimony from our senior military leaders has also been clear and consistent: Our nuclear triad is necessary to keep our nation safe.
Today @HASCDemocrats Chair @RepAdamSmith said he doesn’t think ICBMs are necessary for nuclear deterrence. To casually assert that an entire leg of the triad is superfluous disregards the best advice of our military leadership. It is a dangerous, misguided assertion.
This morning I spoke with @CropLifeAmerica’s board of directors during their legislative rally on Capitol Hill. I appreciate all the work their companies do to provide innovative technology to our farmers in Nebraska and across the nation. #FeedtheWorld

As the 2009 bipartisan Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States stated: ‘Potential aggressors should have to worry about the possibility that the United States might respond by overwhelming means at a time and in a manner of its choosing.
With Russia and China increasingly attempting to intimidate their neighbors – some of whom are U.S. allies – this is the wrong message to send. It betrays a naïve and disturbed world view.
Presidents from both parties, including the Obama administration, have rejected a no-first-use policy because it erodes deterrence, undermines allied confidence in U.S. security guarantees and risks emboldening potential adversaries.
Calculated ambiguity has long been an element of U.S. nuclear declaratory policy.
I had the privilege of working with and getting to know Anne Boyle when she was a respected PSC Commissioner and I was a committee chair as a state senator. Sending her my well wishes.

Just in: The administration has released the Missile Defense Review. Check out my full statement:
During this Congress, I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this key priority and continuing our work in providing for a strong national defense.
While @US_Stratcom is located in Sarpy County, NE, it is a national asset with a global mission – over 180,000 Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and civilians are working every day around the world in support of the command’s mission. #Service
That means any delay or any error, could put at risk our ability to field an effective nuclear deterrent in the future, and we cannot allow that to happen. In the face of growing threats, our deterrent must remain strong.
As a result of decisions to delay and defer funding, there is no margin for error in the schedule.
The command and control networks that our nuclear forces rely on are also in need of replacement, as is the scientific #infrastructure that maintains our stockpile of aging warheads.
As our nuclear deterrent becomes more important to our nation’s defense, the need for nuclear modernization only grows. This conclusion is echoed by the administration’s #NuclearPostureReview.
Meanwhile, our warheads and delivery systems age toward obsolescence, as does the #infrastructure that maintains our deterrent.
With #Russia and #China increasingly seeking to challenge US interests and reshape the geopolitical landscape in their favor, the unique role our nuclear forces play in deterring conflict preventing war is becoming increasingly important.
As part of the effort to ensure our military is prepared for new threats, we must continue modernizing our #nuclearforces.
I’m entering my 7th year on the Senate Armed Services Committee where we’ve continued the committee’s long-standing, bipartisan tradition of working to strengthen our #military.
