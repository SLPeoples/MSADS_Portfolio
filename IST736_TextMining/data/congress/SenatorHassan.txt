For #InternationalWomensDay I want to recognize and congratulate my friend, and a true advocate for women across the world, @SenatorShaheen for the recognition of her work to advance the rights of women and girls around the globe.
We must do more to support our National Guard members and Reservists who bravely sacrifice for our freedom. Our bipartisan bill will help ensure that all who serve have access to mental health care.
On #InternationalWomensDay let’s honor the contributions women have made -- and recommit ourselves to furthering the fundamental rights of women and girls around the world. We can’t stop fighting to ensure that women everywhere are treated equally.
Companies need to get serious about cybersecurity BEFORE a data breach exposes Americans’ personal information, not after. This is an ongoing threat and there have to be standards in place.
RT @repjohnlewis: 54 years ago today, we were beaten, tear gassed, trampled by horses, and left bloody on that bridge in Selma. But we cann…
You can read more about our bipartisan Green Alert Act of 2019 here:
I also want to thank Department Commander Emil Ouellette and the @AmericanLegion for their support for our Green Alert Act and all they do for our veterans.
I want to thank Sergeant Major Paul Chevalier, USMC, Ret. and @VFWHQ for their support and advocacy for this legislation, as well as all of their work to ensure that our veterans have the support and resources they have earned.
Our national bill was inspired by Brigadier General Donald Bolduc, USA, Ret. of Stratham, N.H. who has been a leader in efforts to expand Wisconsin's Green Alert system in states nationwide.
Today, I introduced legislation with @SenJoniErnst to help states implement "Green Alert" systems to locate veterans when they go missing, similar to the AMBER and Silver Alert systems. This is a commonsense way to help veterans who need our support.
RT @AdamSextonWMUR: New legislation from @SenatorHassan @SenJoniErnst would help expand “green alert” systems for at-risk #veterans who a…
The Government Accountability Office found that during the last two years, the EPA has made little progress – and has actually taken steps backward – in identifying toxic chemicals that contaminate our communities like PFAS. This cannot continue.
We are calling on President Trump to prioritize funding in his 2020 budget proposal for states like New Hampshire that have been hardest hit by the opioid crisis.
While at the Department of Justice Chad Readler led the Trump Administration’s efforts to endorse the lawsuit that could take away millions of Americans' health care. Now President Trump wants him to be a federal judge. I just voted NO.
Today, we are introducing our Save the Internet Act. Last Congress, the Senate voted to #SaveTheInternet. This year we need both the House and Senate to pass this bill and ensure that the internet is free and open for all by restoring #NetNeutrality
While at the Justice Department, Chad Readler endorsed a lawsuit that would take away health care from millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions. A day later, President Trump nominated him to be a federal judge. This is yet another attack on Americans' health care.
My grandfather was a pediatrician, and I still remember the tragic stories he told me about what life was like before vaccines. We must remain committed to ensuring that people continue to get vaccinated.
A majority of Senators – both Republicans and Democrats – have pledged to support a resolution revoking the President’s emergency declaration. We must come together across party lines to defend the Constitution and vote to overturn this declaration.
Spent the morning at L3 Technologies in Londonderry, an innovative business that's helping support our national defense. Especially exciting to see the Army's next generation of night vision goggles being developed right here in the Granite State.
I was happy to be in Newton today for the opening of their new fire/rescue station! New Hampshire's brave fire fighters show extraordinary dedication to keeping our citizens safe and this new station will help them continue to protect their fellow Granite Staters.
People deserve to know that their drinking water is healthy and safe. The EPA has dragged its feet for far too long when it comes to addressing PFAS contamination, and we need action. Our bipartisan bill would designate all PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances.
Thinking of the Barnes family and all those impacted. We must never forget the danger our fire fighters and first responders place themselves in to keep us safe.
Forced arbitration clauses undermine the rights of workers and consumers by restricting their ability to take corporations to court. We're working to end forced arbitration by introducing the FAIR ACT to restore Americans' right to seek justice.
Best of luck to all the competitors at today's @FIRSTweets competition! �
Last week, I celebrated #ReadAcrossAmericaDay with the students at Main Street School in Exeter. We read “Strictly No Elephants” – a story about how important inclusion is. What are you reading today?
Proud to have a 100% from the @LCVoters when it comes to protecting the environment.  I won't stop fighting to combat climate change and preserve our precious natural resources.
1) Climate change is real      2) Human activity is the dominant cause     3) Congress must take immediate action to address it    This resolution is simple, I hope our Republican colleagues join us in supporting it.
Former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler’s record of putting big oil and corporate special interests before the health of our people, economy, and environment makes him completely unfit to continue leading the EPA. I voted NO on his confirmation.
It is the height of irresponsibility that government shutdowns are becoming a frequent occurrence, and we must come together to end this madness. I'm introducing a bill with @SenatorLankford that would put an end to shutdowns.
Former Presidents have a variety of ways to earn money after their time in office. That's why I joined @SenJoniErnst in introducing a bipartisan bill to reduce a former President's allowance if they earn more than $400k in a year, helping ensure taxpayer dollars are well-spent.
Breakthroughs aren't breakthroughs if people cannot afford the medications. It’s long past time to address the skyrocketing costs of prescription
The House just passed our bipartisan bill to permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, conserve the Nashua River, and more. This bill is good for New Hampshire and our environment. I urge the President to sign it without delay.
The President's constitutionally dubious emergency declaration would take funding from vital national security priorities to fulfill an ill-conceived campaign slogan. The House just voted to revoke this declaration. I urge my GOP colleagues to vote to revoke it in the Senate too.
I'm proud to stand with @PattyMurray in the fight to ensure that hard-working families have access to the child care they need to get ahead and stay ahead.
More than 100 people are dying from the opioid crisis every day and the pharmaceutical companies that helped fuel this crisis still won't take responsibility. Just today, Janssen’s top exec told me her company’s actions were “very appropriate and responsible.”
This report underscores how critical it is that we take real action NOW to address the impacts of climate change in New Hampshire and across the country.
Big pharmaceutical companies make their pricing so convoluted and nontransparent that it feels like you need a PhD in prescription drug pricing to understand how this industry works. That isn't how it should be.
Tonight, I voted NO on yet another partisan attack on reproductive health care. Women, families and their doctors are capable of making these complicated medical decisions without government interference.
Congratulations!
Primary Bank's new Manchester branch is open for business! Fun to help cut the ribbon this afternoon.
No one should be held back from pursuing a job opportunity because their housing assistance is limited to a particular area. That's why we introduced a bipartisan bill that will give people more flexibility and I'm pleased that it was signed into law.
One of the consequences of the devastating opioid crisis is that many more grandparents are now primary caregivers to their grandchildren. I sat down with grandparents and advocates today to discuss how we can better ensure that these grandfamilies are supported.
BREAKING: The Trump Administration just released its domestic gag rule that undermines women's reproductive rights by attacking providers like Planned Parenthood and threatening millions of people's access to reproductive health care. We will fight this.
We need to do more to prepare young people to make major financial decisions that will have huge impacts on their futures.​ Thank you to @NHCUC for focusing on the critical issue​ of financial literacy at today's Forum on the Future.
A judge has ruled that when Labor Secretary Acosta was a prosecutor, he broke the law by keeping victims in the dark about the lenient deal he gave to a man who committed sex trafficking crimes. He must resign.
This is serious: The FDA Commissioner who led the agency when OxyContin was approved says the agency erred and the label needs to be changed. See the latest from @60Minutes:
The Trump Administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum are hurting New Hampshire businesses like Extreme Networks. I visited today to talk about my bipartisan bill to help relieve that burden and discuss how we're working to protect our economy from these misguided policies.
The EPA now says it intends to set enforceable drinking water standards for PFOA contaminants. People deserve peace of mind when it comes to their drinking water and we must hold EPA accountable and make sure it happens.
Dover's new solar array is exactly the type of innovation we need more of to help build a cleaner, more affordable energy future.
Inspectors general play a vital role in conducting oversight of federal agencies and they must remain free from political interference. Secretary DeVos's team is not above the law, and we must get to the bottom of this.
Had so much fun reading to students at Main Street School in Exeter as part of Read Across America this morning. I chose "Strictly No Elephants" - a wonderful book about the importance of inclusion.
This needs to get more attention. Secretary DeVos is allowing shady, for-profit education institutions to prey on our students and veterans.
President Trump wants to raid the Department of Defense’s military construction accounts to build his border wall, which will have a devastating impact on our national security. We are urging him to reconsider.
The amazing team behind Schilling Beer Co. in Littleton were our Granite Staters of the Month in December for their work to support the victims of the California wildfires and it was a blast to stop by the brewery this afternoon.
Visited Coos County Family Health in Berlin today to discuss how skyrocketing prescription drug prices are squeezing hard-working families. We must act now to hold pharmaceutical companies accountable and lower costs.
.@SenatorCollins and I represent states with aging populations, and we know how difficult getting by in retirement is for many Americans. Read our op-ed about a bipartisan bill we introduced to help Americans plan for retirement:
The top issue I hear about from businesses is the need for more highly skilled workers. I was at White Mountains Community College today to talk about my Gateway to Careers Act, which would support programs like theirs that help prepare Granite Staters for the workforce.
Diverting funds from military construction projects to build the wall would have real effects on our national security. Here’s just one example:
Happy Presidents Day!
Donna Beckman from Seabrook attended the State of the Union address as my guest to help bring attention to an issue too many Americans face – massive surprise medical bills. Listen to her tell her story in her own words:
The Trump Administration is trying to jam through a new Title X domestic gag rule that would prevent health care providers from informing patients about their full range of reproductive health options. We’re fighting back.
Everyone who bravely served should get the support they've earned - regardless of gender. But too many women veterans still face barriers at the VA when it comes to getting care. That's why I've reintroduced the Deborah Sampson Act to address gender disparities at the VA.
Since her sophomore year of high school, Heather has dedicated her time to the fight against the substance misuse crisis. For all her efforts, I'm proud to recognize her as the February Granite Stater of the Month.
Not only is @POTUS declaring a constitutionally dubious state of emergency to fulfill a campaign slogan, he’s even trying to take federal dollars from drug interdiction efforts to do it. This is unconscionable and completely backward.
I'm pleased that the Senate passed a bipartisan compromise agreement to make effective investments in border security, support vital priorities for hard-working Americans, keep the government open. Read more about what’s in the bipartisan agreement here:
Members of both parties have expressed strong concerns both about the legality of such a move and the effect it would have on our national security if the President takes money intended for existing military construction projects.
Declaring a state of emergency to try to fulfill a campaign slogan is a dangerous path to go down and I strongly urge the President to reconsider.
It has been one year since a gunman murdered 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland. In that year, Congress still has not taken meaningful action on gun safety. It’s long past time to act.
Disappointed that William Barr was just confirmed as Attorney General. From his comments on executive power to the special counsel's investigation, Mr. Barr has made clear that he is not fit to lead the Department of Justice. That's why I voted NO.
Parents should not have to worry about whether the water they are giving their children is safe, and the EPA must stop dragging its feet on giving our communities the guidance they need.
Nearly a year ago, Scott Pruitt promised action on setting an enforceable drinking water standard for PFOA and PFOS, yet now the EPA is saying communities will have to wait almost another full year before the EPA will even decide whether it will set a drinking water standard.
It is totally unacceptable that the EPA is once again delaying setting an enforceable drinking water standard. While I appreciate that there are some positive steps forward in this Action Plan, it continues to be lacking on this critical issue.
It is always a pleasure to see Commandant LaBrecque from the NH Veterans Home and to discuss how we can continue to support the critical work they do for New Hampshire's veterans.
We're with you in the fight Bill. Best wishes to you, your family, and all of the @UNHWildcats during this time.
I'm happy to report that the Senate Homeland Security Committee today passed my bipartisan bill with @senrobportman to bolster cyber response teams that help prevent and mitigate cyberattacks.
Today I voted NO on advancing the nomination of William Barr for Attorney General. I remain deeply troubled about his views on executive power and his comments about Special Counsel Mueller's investigation.
The Senate just passed a bipartisan bill with critical NH priorities that @SenatorShaheen and I pushed for: - Permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund- Enhances efforts to conserve the Nashua River- Designates Saint-Gaudens a National Historic Park
After a visit to an ER in her insurance network, Donna was faced with a surprise medical bill of $1,648. Donna came as my guest to the State of the Union to draw attention to this outrageous practice. This is her story:
The people of New Hampshire are tough as granite, but we’ve got nothing on you, Louie. Mailed a letter with the Granite State’s best wishes.
Paid family and medical leave helps ensure that families can afford to take care of newborns or family members suffering from illnesses. I'm proud to cosponsor the FAMILY Act to guarantee paid family leave. It's time to pass it.
Had a wonderful time at the annual Great Meredith Ice Fishing Derby. Congratulations to the Meredith Rotary Club for another successful event. Good luck to all of the derby participants, and stay warm and safe out there!
All hospitals need to have staff trained to treat sexual assault survivors and help them seek justice. I'm joining in reintroducing bipartisan legislation to help ensure that survivors can more easily access quality care by expanding and standardizing training for providers.
Today Newfields unveiled a new solar array, which will help promote sustainability and save taxpayers thousands in costs every year. I'm proud to support this project and efforts like it to build a clean energy future and combat climate change.
Women must be able to make their own reproductive health choices.  This was the right decision. Courts​ must continue to uphold the fundamental rights of women and permanently overturn the Louisiana
Our country faces ever-evolving cybersecurity threats, and it's critical we have a strong federal workforce to help combat those threats. I've joined in reintroducing a bipartisan bill that will help develop our cyber workforce:
The first duty of government is to protect its citizens, and that means continuing to strengthen our counterterrorism efforts. I reintroduced bipartisan legislation with @marcorubio to ensure that all parts of @DHSgov are coordinating effectively to combat terrorist threats.
By reinstating the Global Gag Rule, the President is risking the health and safety of women around the world. I'm proud to cosponsor the Global HER Act to repeal the Gag Rule and help ensure that women across the world can control their own reproductive destinies. #Fight4HER
Read more about the bipartisan CREATES Act here:
Skyrocketing prescription drug prices are unacceptable, and so are the shady practices some drug companies use to block lower-cost generics from entering the market. I'm joining in reintroducing bipartisan legislation that will prohibit these practices and lower costs.
Members of our armed services who earned Medals of Honor or were held as prisoners of war deserve a full military honors burial ceremony -- regardless of their rank. I've joined @SenTomCotton and @SenWarren in introducing bipartisan legislation to ensure that they do.
Thank you to @SenatorShaheen, @SenMarkey and @SenSanders for joining me in introducing the NET METER Act in the Senate and @RepCardenas and @RepLowenthal for introducing companion legislation in the House to help protect our environment and bring down energy costs.
Today I reintroduced my NET METER Act, which will help provide guidance to states that are looking to grow their renewable energy markets. As communities continue to grapple with climate change, we must keep working to build a stronger clean energy future.
.@CADCA does incredible work every day to help prevent alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse in our communities and I was deeply honored to receive this award.
My full statement on President Trump’s State of the Union address:
Heading to the State of the Union address. Thank you again to Donna for being my guest tonight and helping call attention to the outrageous practice of surprise medical bills.
Always great running into a fellow New Englander in the Capitol, @ChrisEvans!
Thanks to the work of dedicated community leaders, the Nashua River has undergone a remarkable transformation into the pristine river we know today. I'm proud to join in reintroducing a bill that will help continue to protect this watershed for generations to come.
Far too many Americans have received surprise medical bills for care they thought was in their insurance network. Donna is one of them, and she's joining me for tonight's #SOTU to help draw attention to this absurd practice.
Prescription drug costs are out of control. These pharmaceutical CEOs need to show up and testify before us on the @SenateFinance committee. Thank you @RonWyden and @ChuckGrassley.
Thank you for having me! And for joining me in the fight to lower student debt and expand economic opportunity.
My statement on the retirement of New Hampshire Department of Safety Commissioner John Barthelmes: #nhpolitics
During tomorrow's #SOTU address, I'll have a special guest in the room: Donna Beckman of Seabrook. Donna received a surprise medical bill for care she thought was in her insurance network. Read about her and how I'm fighting these surprise bills:
I joined @SenatorCollins on the Senate floor this afternoon to discuss the bipartisan Retirement Security Act we introduced to make it easier for Americans to save for retirement.
A Koch subsidiary is being sued for PFAS water contamination. Meanwhile, a former Koch executive is now helping craft the federal government's response to PFAS contamination. This is beyond
Far too many school buildings in the United States are not getting the investment they need and that must change. I helped introduce a bill that will help provide the next generation with the modern school infrastructure they need to succeed in the 21st century economy.
Today I visited Hitchiner Manufacturing to hear about the impact the Trump Administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum are having on N.H. businesses. I've introduced legislation to help relieve the burden that these tariffs have imposed and to help protect our state's economy.
RT @NH_Troopers: K-9 Ragnar is excited about the Patriots winning the Super Bowl!

It's my honor every month to highlight in the Congressional Record some of the extraordinary work of the people of our state – and I had an incredible time getting together with these “Granite Staters of the Month” in Manchester. Watch some of their stories here:
What a fitting tribute for a true
Camp Snow Mo does incredible work helping people who experience disabilities have the opportunity to participate in camp activities, and I was glad to join everyone today in supporting their work.
There’s no better way to start a Saturday than with all the incredible @FIRSTweets competitors at the New Hampshire state championship. May the best robot win!
I had a great time as always stopping by the Farm and Forest Expo. Congrats to all of the award winners and show exhibitors and thank you to our hard-working farmers and forest industry professionals.
We need the best minds at @DHSgov and in the private sector working together to fend off cyberattacks. My bipartisan bill with @senrobportman will help encourage that collaboration and strengthen our cyber defenses.
The Land and Water Conservation Fund plays a vital role in protecting our beautiful natural resources that are critical to our economy and way of life in New Hampshire. @SenatorShaheen and I cosponsored bipartisan legislation to reauthorize this important program.
Girls can do anything. Go Dejah and go Pats!
Excited to serve as the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth, where I’ll keep working to get our country’s fiscal house in order and spur economic growth.
The President’s steel and aluminum tariffs on close allies like Canada and the EU are undermining our global interests and hurting consumers and businesses. We introduced a bill to restore necessary Congressional oversight of these major economic
Read more about the Disability Employment Incentive Act and how it will help break down barriers by incentivizing employers to hire and retain employees who experience disabilities and make their workplaces more accessible.
People who experience disabilities still face far too many barriers in the workforce. I'm reintroducing legislation that will help support more inclusive workplaces.
Listen to Donna tell her story about receiving a surprise medical bill for $1,648 in her own words:
I'm honored to bring Donna Beckman of Seabrook as my guest to the State of the Union. Donna, like too many Americans, received a surprise medical bill for care that she thought was in her insurance network. This practice must end and I thank Donna for sharing her story.
People often receive massive surprise medical bills for things like a visit to the ER that they thought was in their insurance network. If this has happened to you, I want to hear your story. Write to my office about a surprise medical bill you received:
Stories like Abby's and Emma's show why it is so critical that we ensure that students of all abilities are included and have the tools they need to learn. It's great to see this happening in our state. 
Often law enforcement doesn't have the training they need to recognize subtle cries for help when it comes to child trafficking. I've joined in introducing a bill that will help law enforcement officers better protect our kids.
Fifth-grader Evelyn started her successful clothing drive at school because in her words, she "wanted to help people." Read more about our first Granite Stater of the Month of 2019 here:
.@BetsyDeVosED has proposed changes to Title IX guidance that would weaken existing protections for survivors of sexual assault. Today is the LAST day to make your voices heard about her proposal. Find out more about publicly commenting here:
Fifty-six years ago, Congress passed the Equal Pay Act but women -- especially women of color -- still don’t receive equal pay for equal work. That's why I've cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act to help hold businesses accountable when they discriminate on the basis of sex.
Today I participated in my first @SenateFinance Committee hearing, which focused on skyrocketing drug prices. Holding down prescription drug prices is one of my top priorities - and I look forward to working with @ChuckGrassley and @RonWyden on this critical issue.
I spoke with a Granite Stater who received a $3,500 surprise medical bill after going to an in-network ER (he was later told one of the doctors he saw was out-of-network). If you have an outrageous story like this, I want to hear it. You can share it here:
Climate change is happening and it's impacting New Hampshire's Seacoast. I'm on the Senate floor because we need ac…
Low-wage federal contractors provide vital services but they are not currently entitled to back pay after the senseless shutdown. They deserve their paychecks and I'm fighting to pass legislation that will ensure that contract workers receive the pay they have earned. #BackPayNOW
RT @NOAAClimate: Winter storms don't prove that global warming isn't happening. 
The USS Thresher will finally be honored with a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery -- a fitting tribute to 129 brave men who were tragically lost in the deadliest submarine disaster in history. It will be a constant reminder of the crew's selfless sacrifice to our nation.
According to reports, the Trump Administration will not set limits on PFOA and PFOS contaminates in drinking water. Communities across the country are looking to @EPAgov for guidance. If true, this is totally unacceptable.
People often face massive bills for health care they thought was in their insurance network – only to be told later that one of the doctors they saw was actually out-of-network. Read more about my legislation to help end these surprise medical bills here:
I've heard from people in New Hampshire about massive surprise medical bills they've received, often for care they thought was in-network. If you have a story about a surprise medical bill, I want to hear it. Submit yours here:
According to a new nonpartisan report, as a result of the senseless government shutdown:     - The economy lost $11 billion ($3 billion that won't be recovered)  - An untold number of businesses lost revenue    We cannot afford another shutdown.
Proceeds from these coins will go toward carrying on Christa McAuliffe's work by supporting the @FIRSTweets program -- encouraging more young people to engage in STEM fields.
Christa McAuliffe once said, "I touch the future. I teach." That couldn't be more true. Today, we introduced measures in the Senate and House to have coins minted in her honor to celebrate her spirit of exploration and dedication to inspiring young people everywhere.
Happy birthday to my dear friend @SenatorShaheen! Thank you for all you do for the people of New Hampshire – it’s an honor to serve with you in the Senate.
If you want to nominate someone who represents our state’s values and all-hands-on-deck spirit to be a future “Granite Stater of the Month,” fill out the form here:
Last weekend, all of our “Granite Stater of the Month” recipients gathered in Manchester so we could celebrate their selfless work on behalf of the people of New Hampshire.
It is my privilege each month to recognize extraordinary people who represent our state’s all-hands-on-deck spirit as our “Granite Staters of the Month” in the official Congressional Record. Their stories are truly remarkable — watch a few of them here.
I remain deeply concerned about William Barr’s broad view of executive power and his comments about Special Counsel Mueller's investigation – and I oppose his nomination for Attorney General.
Relieved @POTUS finally agreed to reopen the government while we keep negotiating on addressing border security. Americans have suffered because the President turned down this same deal in December. We can find a way forward but he must stop using people as political pawns.
While working to end this shutdown, we are also calling on credit agencies to prevent late or missed payments that occur during this time from negatively impacting federal workers’ credit ratings.
Pleased that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission heeded our call to delay the license review process for Seabrook Station so anyone potentially impacted can provide meaningful input.
I stood on the Senate floor today with a group of bipartisan Senators to send a clear message — let’s pass a clean 3-week bill to reopen the government while we commit to passing strong, bipartisan border security during that time. It’s time for this shutdown to end.
This statement couldn’t be more out-of-touch. The Trump Administration seems to have no idea how this shutdown is harming people across the country. It is time for the President to end his games and reopen the government immediately.
Rising sea levels and climate change continue to threaten New Hampshire's coastline, cutting property values on the Seacoast by $15 million according to a new report. For our economy, our environment, and our people, we must act now.
We heard directly from the Manchester Transit Authority today about how the impacts of the President’s senseless shutdown are only going to get worse. It is essential that the President and Republican leadership come to the table to reopen the government.
The shutdown is having an impact on Americans of all walks of life – people can't get support from federal agencies, communities are worried about food and housing assistance, and some businesses -- like NH's breweries -- can't move forward with new projects. This must end.
It is now day 33 of the President's senseless shutdown and TSA agents, air traffic controllers, and thousands of other federal workers are about to go without their second paycheck. President Trump and Republican leadership need to reopen the government now.
It's been 46 years since Roe v. Wade enshrined a woman's constitutional right to make her own reproductive health choices -- but the attacks on this right have not stopped. We can't and won't stop fighting back.
It's day 32 of the President's politically motivated shutdown and TSA officers are still hard at work – without pay – keeping the public safe. I went to Manchester airport today to hear from them. The first priority must be reopening the government immediately.
In the United States, you should be free to serve your country without discrimination because of your gender identity. President Trump's transgender service ban was reprehensible when it was proposed and it remains reprehensible now.
Honored to join in celebrations of Dr. King's life and legacy in New Hampshire. At a moment where our country is once again facing challenges in our march toward greater inclusion, I'm proud to stand with Granite Staters in fighting for an America that values all people.
Today as we honor the life and legacy of Dr. King Jr., let’s stand up for our values that he so valiantly fought for and continue his work of ensuring that our country lives up to its commitment to the freedom, equality, and dignity of all of our people.
.@Patriots never give up. #EverythingWeGot �
In NH, we are known for the all-hands-on-deck spirit of our people, where people pitch in and do extraordinary work to support their communities. I've been honored to recognize a few of them as Granite Staters of the Month, and tonight I thanked them in person for all they do.
I also met with officials from Keene who are concerned about critical grants being delayed that would impact their community members and ongoing projects. As this shutdown continues, it will keep hurting more and more hard-working people across our country.
I also met with Mayor Lovett of Claremont to hear about the concerns she has for her community as the government shutdown continues. She’s worried about food insecurity for local residents and students, and the impact of the shutdown on affordable housing and rental assistance.
This morning, we broke ground on a new affordable housing project in Claremont that'll help expand economic opportunity in the area and support businesses. Unfortunately, the shutdown is having severe consequences on affordable housing projects in the state and across the country
Today, I'm in western New Hampshire hearing about the impacts President Trump’s senseless government shutdown is having on communities.
It is now day 27 of the President's senseless government shutdown. Granite Staters like Dara – and people across our country – are bearing the brunt of the President's political games. Enough -- @senatemajldr must let us vote and President Trump must reopen the government.
Rather than allowing a vote to reopen the government, Leader McConnell just had the Senate vote on an anti-choice bill. Rather than helping the thousands of Americans impacted by this senseless shutdown, Republicans are focusing, again, on attacking women's reproductive rights.
This is horrifying news. The Trump Administration's policy of separating children from their families was outrageous and cruel, and now we are learning that it was even more widespread than previously reported. There must be accountability.
This is beyond appalling. They must be held accountable.
.@SenatorShaheen and I have reintroduced our bill that would overturn the recent Supreme Court ruling that would put New Hampshire's small businesses at risk of mountains of red tape by forcing them to collect internet sales tax for other states.
We should not make a former coal lobbyist with a record of putting big oil and corporate special interests ahead of our environment, economy, and the health of our people the permanent head of the EPA.
While I'm pleased that the President has signed our bill into law that will ensure that federal workers receive back pay, he needs to actually open the government and end this senseless shutdown.
The picture I'm holding is of Roger, a furloughed worker in New Hampshire who fell ill over the holidays and is worried about how his family will afford their bills. I stood on the Senate steps today to again call on the President and Majority Leader to end this shutdown.
Survivors of sexual and domestic violence will feel the impacts of the President’s senseless shutdown if funding is not quickly restored. It’s long past time for the President’s games to stop and for his shutdown to end.
Today, I am joining my colleagues in reintroducing a resolution that would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to defend Americans' health care against the lawsuit from Republican Attorneys General that would raise costs and take coverage away from millions of Americans.
A new report finds that Americans are now more likely to die of an accidental overdose than a car crash. The urgency of addressing the opioid crisis cannot be overstated.
If you are a Granite Stater and have a story about how the shutdown has impacted you, I want to hear it. Email it to my office at stories@hassan.senate.gov.
Took calls today from Granite Staters who are concerned about the continuing shutdown. I want to thank everyone who has been making their voices heard, it's time the President stops playing games and ends this shutdown.
I'm live on the Senate floor telling the stories of Granite States impacted by the President’s shutdown:
I'll be telling more stories like theirs tonight on the Senate floor. It's time for the President’s games to stop, and for our government to reopen.
On Christmas Eve, Dara's mother passed away and she is facing the expenses of a funeral without a paycheck.
Lanna has young children and she's worried about going into debt over child care.
Earlier this week, I received letters from some of New Hampshire's hard-working air traffic controllers. I wanted to share a bit of their letters here:
Congratulations to @UofNH for being recognized as one of our country’s top-tier research universities!
Thank you, Carter, for helping make sure everyone is included.
Proud to serve with so many extraordinary women at a time when the face of Congress is changing.
Reproductive health choices should be between a woman and her doctor – not her employer. We can’t stop fighting back against the Trump Administration’s attacks on women’s reproductive health.
The beautiful home, studio, and gardens of Augustus Saint-Gaudens play an important role in the local economy and deserve the recognition that comes with the title of a National Historic Park. This week I joined the NH delegation in introducing a bill to designate it as one.
Skyrocketing prescription drug prices are one of the top challenges I hear about from people across New Hampshire, and I reintroduced legislation to help lower costs. You can read about the bills here.
I visited the Nashua Soup Kitchen to discuss the impacts of the President’s shutdown. The longer this shutdown goes on the more uncertainty organizations like New Hampshire‘s food kitchens face. It must end now.
I've heard from Granite Staters who are describing their fears of not being able to afford gas, rent, or food. They are not “better off.”
It's official -- the President's government shutdown is now the longest in history. And each day, the hardships on Granite Staters impacted by the shutdown grow. It's time for these games to end and for Republicans and President Trump to end this shutdown.
Visited with @StraffordCAP in Dover this afternoon to hear about how the harmful government shutdown will impact their mission of providing food, education, and child care services to Granite Staters in the area.
Today, I sat down with community orgs and staff at the Nashua Soup Kitchen to hear their concerns about the impacts of the senseless government shutdown on their work and the people they serve. As it drags on, we know the impacts will only grow more severe. This cannot continue.
This shouldn’t be necessary but I’m proud to see New Hampshire businesses stepping up and supporting their neighbors impacted by the shutdown.
The House voted yesterday to challenge the awful ruling that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. This decision would raise health care costs and take away coverage from millions of Americans if it’s not overturned, we can't stop fighting.
Pharmaceutical companies are allowed to write-off billions in advertising costs at taxpayers’ expense, while at the same time padding their pockets by increasing drug prices. I'm cosponsoring @SenatorShaheen's bill to end their advertising tax break.
The President’s senseless government shutdown is hurting hard-working Granite Staters, and if you’re one of them, I want to hear from you. We need to make clear to Republicans in Congress and President Trump what’s at stake. Email me your story at stories@hassan.senate.gov.
The President's shutdown is increasingly putting the health and safety of Americans at risk. It is time for this senseless shutdown to end.
