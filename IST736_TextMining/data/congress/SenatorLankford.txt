Spoke on the Senate floor about my simple proposal to reduce the 30 hours of post-cloture debate time to 2 hours for most nominees. Reducing post-cloture debate time for noms isn’t new. Democrats not only supported it, they proposed it themselves during the 113th Congress.
@GabbyOrr_ I was in that dinner-POTUS did not “lace into Coons” he was not “in his face” and POTUS was not “worked up.” There was a conversation about abortion but POTUS simply asked a question to understand Sen Coons perspective- @ChrisCoons shared his thoughts and so @realDonaldTrump
As we work to improve care at our nation’s VA medical centers, we can also honor thank our heroes by serving them in our communities.
My res. w/@RoyBlunt just passed @SenateRules. SRes50 updates Senate rules by reducing post-cloture time from 30 to 2 hours for most noms. Keeps 30 hours for SCOTUS, Circuit Courts, Cabinet. Post-cloture debate time should be for debate, not delay on an empty Senate floor.

We can and should welcome legal immigration and refugees when people do the right thing, the right way. I am glad @POTUS focused the border security conversation on tech as a crucial part of the larger border security strategy along with fencing and other options.

I joined @FoxNews this morning to discuss options to end the shutdown and fund border security. I also outlined my solution to end gov’t shutdowns in a simple way.

If we want to make significant changes, we must put forward bold solutions that reduce debt and deficits, prevents gov’t shutdowns, and make the process far more transparent to the American people. Click to watch my full speech:
We have 12 appropriations bills that address spending, but we don’t have a bill that addresses saving. I propose we add a 13th bill to address ways to save – a deficit reduction bill. I proposed 2 amendments today that would do this.
Let’s make the budget a law—right now it’s only a “guiding” document for Congress. Making it law gives an enforceable budget levels that can help prevent gov’t shutdown threats making the budget fight happen on the front end
Congress should have certain penalties when it fails to complete its basic functions to pass a budget and the essential funding bills that follow
Let’s require Congress to do regular deficit reduction. We do approps every yr, but we do not address long-term debt and deficit issues. Debt ceiling doesn't work. We continue to raise we never reign in debt. Let’s replace make Congress consider deficit reduction pkges
We aren’t going to get a better budget until we get a better process. This bill addresses biannual budgeting, but there is still so much more we should do. I will continue to push for budget reform solutions
Our charge by law is to “significantly reform the budget and appropriations process.” That doesn’t mean tinker around the edges of reform – that means go big. Let’s fix the budget mess once and for all.
Our broken immigration system affects millions of families and our economy. Now is the time to work together to solve issues with #DACA, border security, asylum, TPS, and more.
