By passing #HR1, the House is advancing historic reforms that place the interests of ordinary citizens over powerful special interests. Those calling this a power grab need a civics lesson. In our democracy, power BELONGS to the people.
Proud that my Automatic Voter Registration Act is a key part of the historic #HR1. #Vermont has achieved nearly 93% voter registration through automatic voter registration. It's time for the nation to follow VT's lead increase citizens' participation in our democracy.
