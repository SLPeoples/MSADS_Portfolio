10 million children in the U.S. live in poverty—and many come from families that can't afford their basic needs. That's why I’m excited to cosponsor the #AmericanFamilyAct with my colleagues @MichaelBennett @SenSherrodBrown, so we can break the vicious cycle of poverty.
Read my full #InternationalWomensDay statement:
This is just a snapshot of the brave women who dare to speak up for fundamental rights. So on #IWD19, as we reflect on the achievements of women, and reflect on the work that remains to be done, I call on all of us to redouble our efforts to free women #politicalprisoners.
In #Eritrea, Aster Fissehatsion has been held incommunicado without charge or trial since September 2001. Her whereabouts, 17 years later, are still not known. She was arrested together with 10 other members of a group of political dissidents known as the Group of 15.
#China has also targeted Tibetan #Buddhist nuns. The government expelled thousands of nuns from Larung Gar in Sichuan. Their homes were demolished; they were barred from entering other monasteries, and faced detention, harassment and abuse. #IWD19
#China is responsible for some of the worst #humanrights abuses, including the imprisonment of #Uighur women in detention camps. These women are forced to renounce their Muslim religion and Uighur language. Forced labor, torture and death are common. #IWD19
In #Egypt, Hanan Badr el-Din, a human rights defender and co-founder of the Families of the Forcibly Disappeared Association, was detained on May 6, 2017 at Qanatar prison while visiting an individual who had been forcibly disappeared. #IWD19
In the #Philippines, Senator Leila de Lima, a brave champion of #humanrights, has been one of the only leaders bold enough to oppose President Duterte’s “war on drugs” and has faced prolonged arbitrary detention. #IWD19
In #SaudiArabia, multiple female activists have been in prison without charges: Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef, Eman al-Nafjan, Nouf Abdelaziz, Mayaa al-Zahrani, Samar Badawi, Nassima al-Saada, Hatoon al-Fassi, Shadan al-Onezi, and Amal al-Harbi. #IWD19
Since it’s #IWD19, I want to highlight a tiny fraction of the countless number of women girls held behind bars unjustly. The repressive governments detaining them are just SOME of the governments around the world that lock up women for exercising their fundamental freedoms...

RT @terischultz: "No one's going anywhere as it relates to #NATO - the US certainly is not" pledges @SenatorMenendez re: @realDonaldTrump's…
We face serious threats to our democratic institutions, our security, our values, and our economies.The path ahead may be rocky, but only together can we overcome them.
The US and Europe have spent decades working to build a rules-based international order that supports stability, preserves peace, advances economic opportunity for all. Yet these rules are under assault by #Iran’s support for terror, a revanchist #Russia, and a rising #China.
 The dialogue between the US and Europe, at all levels, must deepen.We need engagement not just between heads of state, but from legislature to legislature, party to party, civil society to civil society, business to business, and citizen to citizen.
 We must consistently act in support of #NATO.  That means that all political leaders in the United States, including the president, should never waver from a robust and rock solid commitment to the Alliance.
 Likeminded public servants on both sides of the Atlantic must renew efforts to support the democratic process, civil society, and #humanrights abroad.
 Change begins at home. We must defend our alliances by making clear to our people exactly what is at stake: nothing short of peace, prosperity, and #democracy itself.
What can we do to strengthen the transatlantic bond? I have a few ideas...
Instead of attacking our friends in Europe (as President Trump has done), we should redouble our efforts to find areas of common ground.In a world where we need to work together to face real threats, I for one humbly believe that the US should LECTURE less and LEAD more.
We can point to actions of the Trump Admin—its decision to withdraw from the #ParisClimateAccords, its imposition of steel tariffs, its downgrading of long-held universal values of democracy and #humanrights—that put our translatlantic relationship under serious strain.
It’s also the 5th anniversary of the start of #Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity. I want to express my solidarity with the #Ukrainian people as this conflict grinds into its 6th year. May it be the last.
Just spoke at @gmfus, a key pillar of the transatlantic relationship. Thank you for your leadership and the efforts of your staff!
