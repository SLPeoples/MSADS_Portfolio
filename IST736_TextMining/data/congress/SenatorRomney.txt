Our national debt is more than $22 trillion dollars. And this year, we are set to add another $1 trillion. Our government must find ways to pay down our debt, starting with the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse in government programs.
China invests in Italy’s factories, buildings, and culture: welcome news. China wants to invest in your PORTS, however, don’t be fooled: They are looking for a stranglehold.
The Senate Youth Program recognizes some of the nation’s top student leaders, and Emmalyn and Keven are two of Utah’s brightest. I look forward to their continued accomplishments as part of the next generation of leaders.
Welcomed this large group of Utah’s farmers and ranchers to the Capitol this morning to talk Utah agriculture challenges—trade policies that would open markets for agriculture exports, H-2A visas, and land management policies. Thanks for coming by!
Many have questioned why we continue to have a military presence in the Middle East. Questioned the Iraq and Saudi Arabia Ambassador nominees on why U.S. engagement in the Middle East is necessary for the security of our country, our allies, and the world.
Welcomed commissioners from Uintah, Iron, Washington, and Davis counties to our nation’s capital yesterday. I appreciated hearing your priorities and am grateful for your service. Look forward to working with you all.
Multiple sclerosis hits close to home—it’s been almost 20 years since Ann was diagnosed. Thanks, @MSsociety, for all of your work advocating for those living with MS in Utah and across the country.
Our country is losing on average 20 veterans and service members a day to suicide—it’s heartbreaking. This is a positive step toward providing our nation’s veterans with the care they deserve.
Rising health care costs are a big concern for Utah families and small businesses. That’s why I joined my fellow first-term Senators to urge Senate Leadership to take action on the Health Insurance Tax and prevent more cost hikes.
Met with the mayors of Provo, Spanish Fork, Salem, Nephi, Levan, and Manti, as well as members of the Provo and Salem city councils, this week. I appreciated hearing about their plans to ensure inexpensive reliable power for their residents.
Given that China has closed many U.S. cultural centers, our government and the schools that enter these agreements, should take a hard look at whether we should continue to allow Confucius Institutes to operate in our country.
I have serious concerns about how little we know about Confucius Institutes and whether they are part of an influence campaign by the Chinese government to shape the attitudes of young Americans.
Great to have @ChuckGrassley visit the office this morning. I’m looking forward to working with him during this Congress on ways to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.
With more than 25 years of experience in environmental policy, Mr. Wheeler is well-qualified to lead the @EPA. I look forward to working with him to ensure that our environmental policies help promote economic growth while also preserving our environment and natural resources.
We should all be concerned that we do not yet have a comprehensive strategy to deal with the rise of China. This should be an urgent priority for Congress and the Administration.

Pleased to see this bipartisan public lands package head to the President’s desk to become law.
Tonight, Senate Democrats blocked a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. It’s unconscionable inhumane that some in our country, especially members of Congress, are unwilling to take a stand and support the lives of newborns who survive an abortion attempt.

Three years ago, Abdusalam emigrated to Salt Lake City, enrolling in a firefighting program through @USDA’s Job Corps. I recently congratulated him on being named the 2019 Corpsmember of the Year. Best of luck as you embark on the training to become a wildland firefighter!
Responsible energy development is important to Utah’s energy industry and rural economies. This lease agreement will bring jobs and generate revenue to support the local economy in Kane, Garfield, and Sevier counties, while also protecting our national resources.
I'll reserve judgment on any potential executive action by the President until I'm able to fully evaluate it, but as I’ve said, I don't believe declaring a national emergency is the right approach. I'd also expect the President to stay within statutory and constitutional limits.
While today's funding bill is far from perfect, it includes critical funding for border security and immigration enforcement, and prevents another harmful government shutdown. I am glad the Senate was able to conclude this unfinished business from last year.
#OTD 149 years ago, Seraph Young became the first woman to vote in the United States—just two days after the Utah Territory passed its suffrage laws. 25 Utah women voted that day, nearly four decades before passage of the 19th Amendment. #utpol

The #LandsPackage2019 is the culmination of years of collaboration and cooperation between Utah county commissioners and local groups, ensuring provisions were locally-driven instead of dictated by Washington bureaucrats. This legislation is good for Utah.

Joined my fellow Utahns this afternoon to honor the life of former North Ogden mayor Major Brent Taylor, and the sacrifices of his family. Proud the Senate passed a resolution this week to rename the North Ogden @DeptVetAffairs Outstation in his name.
The people we love, the friendships we have, our associations with one another—this is the real currency in life. By this measure, Major Brent Taylor was an extraordinarily wealthy man. Today, we honored the life of this great man and his family.
Speaking with @BoydMatheson now on @kslnewsradio. Listen here:
While I welcome efforts by the administration to reach a political solution in Afghanistan and eliminate ISIS in Syria, I believe that – based on conditions on the ground – we must maintain a sufficient U.S. presence in both places to protect our national security interests.
When it comes to foreign policy, I have been encouraged by the administration’s decisions to support the people of Venezuela and take a hard line against Iranian aggression.
The Trump Administration deserves credit for working to cut taxes and regulations, which have helped boost our economy and raise wages.
He highlighted several critical policy areas where there are opportunities for both parties to work together – including lowering health care costs, reforming trade policies to better protect American workers, and strengthening border security and immigration enforcement.
The president’s speech was strong, well-delivered, and appealed to our patriotism and common values as Americans.

I firmly believe we must expand parental choice and create more opportunities in education. Met with representatives of Utah’s Head Start to learn more about their work to ensure Utah’s children families have early access to the support needed to thrive and be self-sufficient.
I continue to believe the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces from Syria and Afghanistan would be a grave mistake that could pose serious risks for our national security. For that reason, I will be supporting @SenateMajLdr’s amendment.

On #HolocaustRemembranceDay, we renew our commitment to never forget the men, women, and children, including the nearly six million Jews, who were senselessly murdered during the Holocaust. Today, #WeRemember.
I’m encouraged by today’s agreement, which will put people back to work and make sure they get paid. Both parties must work together in the next three weeks on a final agreement that funds border security and avoids another shutdown.
Utahns have been clear—end the shutdown and secure the border. I voted today to do both. With both measures having failed, it’s time now for Republican and Democratic leaders to come together and negotiate a final deal that funds border security and reopens the government.

My responsibility is to Utahns—to represent their interests and values in the Senate. I look forward to hearing from Utah residents at my first town hall meeting tonight in Farmington.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had a message not of anger or resentment, but one of hope and opportunity. He had a tremendous capacity to inspire and uplift. On #MLKday, we honor this champion for civil rights.
.@POTUS has put forth a reasonable, good faith proposal that will reopen the government and help secure the border. I look forward to voting for it and will work to encourage my Republican and Democratic colleagues to do the same.
The Beehive State is a great place to do business. I encourage more businesses to take advantage of Utah’s fast-growing economy and consider setting up shop in rural and urban Utah.
Because of Utah’s fast-growing economy, Davis Smith chose Salt Lake City over other U.S. cities as the location to launch his outdoor gear company. Glad I had the opportunity to meet with him and his family during their trip to Washington.
Utah has had the fastest-growing labor force of any U.S. state since 2010, growing at more than triple the nation’s pace.

This attack is a somber reminder that the threat from ISIS persists, and that the Administration’s decision to retreat from Syria now is a grave mistake.
My heart goes out to the loved ones of the U.S. personnel killed in the terrorist attack in Syria. We will never forget their service and sacrifice to protect the values we hold most dear.

We had our first constituents drop by the office today! Steve and Karen came all the way to Washington, D.C. from Orem.
For too long, Washington bureaucrats have dictated to our counties, ranchers, and recreators how and if they can use their lands. I’m proud to sponsor legislation that puts an end to excessive landgrabs and provides rural Utahns a voice in land management.
Great meeting with my colleague @RepJohnCurtis today to discuss ways to tackle Utah priorities, starting with the Emery County Public Land Management Act. This local-led legislation serves as a model for how public land decisions should be made.
Spoke with new North Ogden Mayor Brent Chugg this afternoon. He has some big shoes to fill after the passing of Major Brent Taylor, yet I remain confident he will continue leading the city toward economic growth.
Each day, our men and women in law enforcement put their lives on the line to protect ours. Utahns were recently reminded of this with the tragic passing of Officer Joe Shinners. This #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay, we recognize all they do to keep our communities safe.
Our state has helped to keep Utah's five national parks open during this shutdown. I applaud @Interior for releasing additional funds dedicated toward the basic needs and public safety in our parks. Special thanks to my Utah House colleagues for their efforts to make this happen.
Heartbroken with the tragic passing of Officer Joseph Shinners last night in the line duty—a loving husband and new father. Ann and I extend our deepest condolences to Officer Shinners' family, friends, and fellow @ProvoPolice officers. God bless our men and women in uniform.
Rep. Tlaib took the politics of Washington deeper down the drain. Elected leaders should elevate, not degrade, our public discourse.
Happy birthday to the beautiful state of Utah!
With deep appreciation.
Used my dad’s Bible for today’s swearing-in. He inscribed a message in it each time he took the oath of office, and I did the same today. It’s an honor to serve.
To the people of Utah: Thank you for entrusting me with the responsibility of serving you in the United States Senate.
Excited for this next chapter. Let's do this.
