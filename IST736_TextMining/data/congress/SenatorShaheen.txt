While visiting the State House today, it was great to talk w/ the 4th grade class from Deerfield Community School. I asked who was going to run for office someday got lots of raised hands! They also voted on the official state dessert. Verdict: ice cream. Can't argue with that
Grateful for the leadership of NH Senate President @DonnaSoucy in the State Senate, New Hampshire for the women and girls who look up to her. Always good to stop by the State House see the great work she’s doing, and especially so on #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2019
Whether it’s women's access to comprehensive health care services, girls having the tools they need to complete their education, or equal female representation in leadership and decision-making — we have more work to do to ensure these issues remain front and center. #IWD2019
Protecting the rights of women girls around the globe is a national security priority and a moral obligation. The Senate’s unanimous approval of our resolution reaffirms Congress’ commitment to these objectives challenges us to keep fighting for full equality for all women.

It’s time Congress takes action to undo the Trump admin’s reckless repeal reinstate these protections. Glad to help introduce the Save the Internet Act to do just that.
There is bipartisan support in Congress to restore net neutrality protections which support NH rural communities, small biz consumers. Americans overwhelmingly support net neutrality protections.

NH has received a big funding increase to provide opioid treatment- a result of the NH delegation's bipartisan efforts. Today, I joined w/ @SenatorHassan @RepAnnieKuster @RepChrisPappas to call on Pres. Trump to prioritize more funding in his 2020 budget

Our servicemen and women deserve the best support and care when they come home. I’ll continue to reach across the aisle and explore ways to provide federal resources for programs like Beyond the Yellow Ribbon that prioritize veteran suicide prevention.
I’m glad @realDonaldTrump is addressing this critically important issue. This is a step in the right direction. Funding programs to confront the alarming rate of veteran suicides has been remains a top priority for me.
This mirrors the successful efforts to reduce teen smoking of standard cigarettes. Read more:
My bill would force e-cig companies to pay fees that would fund regulation enforcement, including those that are designed to protect young people, and awareness campaigns, to set the record straight about e-cigs.
I appreciate @SGottliebFDA’s  work on limiting teen access to flavored e-cigarettes and I hope that the next Commissioner of the FDA will build on these initial efforts. Congress also has a role to play here and I’ve introduced legislation to confront this crisis.
Yet, this youth e-cig crisis didn’t start by accident. E-cig manufacturers, like Juul, aggressively marketed their product to young people by using cutting edge targeting on social media:
The Surgeon General warns that nicotine, regardless of delivery device, “can cause addiction and can harm the developing adolescent brain. ” It’s also linked to liver lung damage, increased heart rate blood pressure, insulin resistance type 2 diabetes in chronic use cases.
What’s more? Research is showing that teens who use e-cigarettes are more likely to progress to smoking traditional
And in just one year (2017-2018), e-cig use among high schoolers rose by 78%! 
This is a trend experienced across the country w/ nearly 21% of high school students nationally now reporting using e-cigarettes. And this problem is by no means limited to high schools—just under 5% of middle schoolers report using a vaping device.
This is why teen vaping is a crisis: In NH, nearly 24% of high school teens report having recently used an e-cigarette and 41% say they’ve tried it. Just over 50% of 12th graders have tried a vaping device.

Around the world, women and girls are suffering at the hands of their own governments. “Lucia’s” devastating story reminds us what is at stake – we cannot compromise on women’s health and freedom – around the world, or here in the U.S.
This is so tragic. Praying for the Barnes family and for the others who were hospitalized. This is a very poignant reminder of the bravery and sacrifice of firefighters.
This plan would be a big step forward. Flavored e-cigs have helped fuel a surge in youth e-cig use. Agree w/ @SGottliebFDA: this is an epidemic. It’s also time for Congress to act. I intro’d the E-cigarette Youth Protection Act to force e-cig companies to pay for prevention/regs
Our bill – the PFAS Action Act – would help us achieve those goals to ensure families can trust the water they drink in NH across the nation. Read more here:
That’s why I worked w/ a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce legislation to designate PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under our environmental protection laws. We need to address contamination, increase transparency hold responsible parties accountable.
NH families shouldn’t have to worry about the safety of their drinking water every time they turn on the tap. As the nationwide PFAS health impact study moves forward, Congress must keep working take steps to ensure our environment and water supplies are clean.
Read our letter to the President here:
I believe in science. It’s alarming the President does not. That's why I joined Sen. @SenBrianSchatz to urge POTUS to abandon his anti-climate panel that would threaten our national security. This is an attempt to dispute confirmed, scientific facts all to score political points.

Very pleased to see the House follow in the Senate’s footsteps and pass this legislation – I look forward to seeing it signed into law! I’ll always fight for efforts that boost NH’s outdoor economy and preserve our state’s land, natural resources, wildlife beauty.
This could impact Portsmouth Naval Shipyard or the NH National Guard. That’s unacceptable. Watch my full remarks on the bipartisan, bicameral effort in Congress to stop the President’s actions here:

Appreciate the opportunity to speak at @BrookingsFP today during their #DemocracyAndDisorder symposium about the United States’ role in upholding the post-WWII global order. We need to have this conversation now more than ever before.
This is spot on. Pres Trump shouldn’t be taking critical resources away from national security priorities to pay for his border wall. We need to do more at ports of entry where most drugs are coming into the country, not on a senseless campaign promise.
Climate change is a real and present threat, and we need to be ready. This is important reporting on how it is already affecting roads, bridges and other infrastructure. 
Very pleased that Army Corps is moving forward with dredging for Rye Harbor. This is a big priority for local fishermen and businesses. I’ll continue to fight for funding and push Army Corps to begin work as soon as possible.
I will never stop fighting for Kelly, and for all women, to protect their choice – their right – to make the decision that is best for them and their families.
“…It is important for women to have the choice to make the decision that is right for her life, her baby’s life, her family’s life.”
“…We are people who are already facing death, either to ourselves or to our child and have to decide what is best in this situation. Each person is different, there is no one size fits all solution…”
To use Kelly’s own words: “I would like people to know that people, like me, who have had abortions later in pregnancy are not people who change their mind about having a child. We are people who are loving, caring, and have to make choices that nobody would ever want to make...”
I recently heard from Kelly in Concord, NH – she had to make this heart wrenching decision. No one wants to be in this position. I stand with Kelly, and women and families throughout NH across the country in defense of maternal and reproductive health.
We must always remember that abortions that are performed later in pregnancy are often done so as a result of severe fetal diagnoses and the serious risks that the pregnancy poses to the life of the woman.
The bill forced by Senate Republicans today would significantly interfere with the doctor-patient relationship pose new obstacles to a woman’s constitutional right to make her own decisions about her reproductive health.
Women should have access to comprehensive reproductive health services without the interference of politicians, and without fear that their providers will be intimidated out of delivering that critical care. Full stop.
Enjoyed discussing my work on the Senate Foreign Relations committee w/ @emilyctamkin. Women must be represented in every discussion about America’s diplomacy and national security. Read more:

I wrote a letter to President Trump warning him not to take critical federal funding from military construction projects at PNSY and the NH National Guard. This so-called national emergency is an unconstitutional power grab by the President.
The best indeed! So wonderful to see Tony celebrating his 100th birthday with his family and friends. We are all grateful for his service.
Pleased that @EPA has heeded my @SenCapito’s call has committed to establish federal, enforceable drinking water standards for PFOA PFOS. This is welcome news for NH families who have fought to ensure the safety of their drinking water. I’ll urge the EPA to follow through.
If you need assistance preparing your tax returns and e-filing this tax season, check out the resources available through @AARP, NH Legal Aid and @graniteuwnh. More information here:
When candidate Trump campaigned in NH he promised Mexico would pay for his border wall. Yet, the so-called “national emergency” is forcing taxpayers to foot the bill by raiding drug interdiction military construction projects, like those at PNSY NH National Guard. My letter:
The Trump admin’s junk plans will take us back to a time when Americans could be denied health coverage for pre-existing conditions and be forced to pay sky-high medical bills out of pocket. @MarkWarner and I introduced legislation to block the admin from promoting these plans.
A positive conversation with @PrimeministerGR at the Munich Security Conference about the importance of the U.S.-Greece relationship how our nations can work together.
I urge the admin to immediately submit a certification to Congress or seek a national security waiver, as required. The foot-dragging and shallow excuses must end.
The admin’s refusal to verify that efforts are being taken to end the war in Yemen violates the law I authored w/ @SenToddYoung that demanded accountability for the Saudi-led coalition’s access in Yemen. @POTUS doesn’t get to sidestep congressional oversight when it’s convenient.
We must remain vigilant and ignore the junk science about vaccinations, particularly as Russian social media accounts try to sow disinformation and discord.
The increase in measles cases around the country highlights how important it is to make sure kids are vaccinated. Thankfully, as of today, NH is free of the disease because of our high rate of immunization.
Everyone should be able to access high-quality medical coverage that they can afford. I introduced legislation with @BrianSchatz to create a public health care option through Medicaid to provide coverage for families while simultaneously lowering costs.
Our founding fathers enshrined in the constitution a division of powers to prevent this type of power grab from a President. It’s now incumbent on Republicans in Congress to join with Democrats to stand up for the constitution and for democracy.
He is also diverting funding set aside for military construction projects, which could potentially include the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the NH National Guard. I will formally call on the Trump admin to not draw resources from projects and grants for our state.
In the midst of an opioid drug epidemic and national health emergency that’s claiming over 70,000 lives a year, President Trump is diverting money from drug interdiction in order to erect a costly and ineffective border wall that he promised Mexico would pay for.
A fascinating look at how @SpragueEnergy cut their energy costs by investing in renewable energy and solar. Great to see a NH company prioritizing sustainability!
The President’s plan to declare a national emergency is an unfortunate, last ditch effort to force the American people to pay for a costly, ineffective wall that he said Mexico would pay for. Challenges at our border should continue to be addressed by working across the aisle.
Relieved that we passed legislation to fund the government, but I’m very disappointed that our agreement does not provide back pay for contractors impacted by the shutdown.  Federal workers contractors serve the American people and should never again be used as political pawns.
My Valentine. ️
Allowing people who are approaching retirement to buy into Medicare at 50 would provide them with reliable health care as well as peace of mind. This legislation would be a big step forward on improving the accessibility and affordability of health care.

This is devastating. The Rocks Estate is iconic in New Hampshire. What a major loss for the Bethlehem community and the Forest Society. Grateful that no one was hurt.
I’ll continue to urge @EPA to heed the bipartisan calls in Congress and establish enforceable drinking water standards to maintain consistency in safety levels from state to state.
Without a commitment to develop enforceable drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, there’s no certainty that this strategy will sufficiently confront the challenges PFAS chemicals pose to states and affected communities.
While I’m glad to see @EPA release their long-awaited National PFAS Management Plan, it falls short of delivering the certainty that families impacted by PFAS exposure need and deserve.

I’ve just introduced legislation that would restore these important awareness campaigns regarding open enrollment so that the public can shop for health care plans make informed choices.

For decades, El Chapo trafficked lethal drugs into the U.S., destroying so many lives. His conviction is a victory for our nation and the rule of law. A big thank you to all law enforcement involved.

The recent government shutdown took a terrible toll on many NH families and businesses, and must not be repeated. I appreciate that the President again committed to reducing the cost of prescription drugs and investing in our nation's infrastructure.
However, I was disappointed that the President didn't deliver a commitment to refrain from once again shutting down the government, or outline a willingness to compromise as Congress seeks a bipartisan agreement to fund the government and provide additional border security.
The President is correct that bipartisanship and compromise can yield results for the American people, as it has for addressing the opioid epidemic, veterans’ health care, childhood cancer, criminal justice reform and many other critical issues.

I’m introducing bipartisan legislation with @SenatorCollins to prohibit LGBT discrimination during the federal jury selection process. Any sort of bias that penalizes potential jurors because of their sexual orientation or gender identity runs counter to our nation’s values.
This is the right decision. As this case proceeds, it is important that Congress take action on bipartisan legislation that I cosponsored to ensure “blue water” Navy veterans who bravely served our country in Vietnam receive the benefits they’re owed.
We must never stop fighting for equal pay for equal work. It’s been 10 years since the signing of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and we still have a long ways to go before we close the pay gap. I’ll keep fighting until women’s work is valued the same as men’s.
Climate change is real, it’s here it’s a threat to NH. The Trump admin needs to stop prioritizing the needs of energy lobbyists over American families heed the warnings of scientists. The admin must reverse course on its dangerous policies.

It’s official: the USS Thresher will be honored with a memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. Thank you to the tireless work of the NH community who advocated for this monument to Army Secretary Mark Esper.
We need to make sure the government stays open. I’m LIVE on the Senate floor to discuss how we can work across the aisle, as we have done in the past, to pass common sense measures to improve security at the border and fund the government.
Border security remains a bipartisan priority and I hope this agreement will provide a valuable opportunity to stem the flow of drugs coming across the border and make needed reforms to our immigration system.
I’m very relieved that the President has finally agreed to reopen the government and we need to pass this legislation immediately to provide relief to federal workers and the American people. This shutdown is reckless and completely unnecessary, and shouldn’t have ever happened.
The President’s shutdown is hurting federal workers across NH. During this difficult time, I’m so appreciative of the organizations Granite Staters stepping up helping out. I’ll keep fighting to reopen the government so Americans can get back to work.
Federal workers are struggling to put food on the table and pay their mortgages because of the President’s reckless shutdown. I’m introducing a bill w/ @TimKaine @SenatorHassan to allow these workers to access an emergency source of funding as they face a second missed payday.
Helping those who helped us on the battlefield isn't just the right thing to do - it's a national security objective that will help our soldiers diplomats for years to come. The admin must stop w/ visa delays. We must keep our promise to protect these brave Afghan civilians.

Our veterans deserve to have their appeals for disability benefits streamlined, which is why I worked across the aisle to pass legislation to reform the appeals process. I’m very pleased to see these reforms moving forward to help our veterans get the help they've earned.
Business has been good at @Wing_itz, and they were planning to open a 3rd location. Now their SBA loan is on hold because of the President's shutdown. @POTUS must reopen government. He can end this reckless shutdown now with a stroke of a pen.
Two years ago @POTUS instated the largest expansion of the #GlobalGagRule ever stripped women children across the globe of vital health protections. This cruel policy undermines global health has devastated communities in need. I’ll keep working across the aisle to end it.
Alarming. The admin should prioritize a national defense policy that protects our military readiness and supports all of our service members – not one that violates their civil rights. I’ll continue to stand up for all transgender service members who proudly serve our nation.
Still here. �
Study after study confirms that climate change is already causing serious economic pain, including along NH’s Seacoast. It’s past time for the President and Republican leadership to work across the aisle to tackle this climate crisis head on.
#RoevWade enshrined into law the fundamental right for women to make their own reproductive choices. Yet 46 years later, we still see near-constant, partisan attacks on women’s health. Thank you @SabrinaEDunlap. We will fight to protect this right.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s dedication to justice awoke the conscience of our nation and changed the course of history. His legacy challenges us to continue fighting for equality and a more perfect union.

Very saddened to learn of Dr. Arthur Hilson’s passing and my condolences go out to his family. My full statement:
President Trump is holding hostage hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and he is being enabled by @senatemajldr, who refuses to bring forward the bills that would open the government today. We need to end this shutdown now.
I am so appreciative of the NH businesses helping those who have been impacted by the President’s shutdown. I’m urging @senatemajldr to allow a vote on Republican bills to reopen the government and to end this shutdown immediately.
