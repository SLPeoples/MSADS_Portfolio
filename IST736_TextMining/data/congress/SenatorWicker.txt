ICYMI: I spoke from the Senate floor in honor of Russian opposition leader Boris #Nemtsov. Four years after his assassination, justice has yet to be served. See my full speech here 
When others were silent out of fear or complicity, Boris #Nemtsov stood up for a future where the Russian people need not risk jail or worse for simply wanting a say in how their country is run.
Today I spoke on the Senate floor to mark the fourth anniversary of Boris #Nemtsov's assassination in Moscow.
The #GreenNewDeal is not just expensive, it is bad policy. It would raise energy bills, eliminate air travel, and require the replacement of 99% of all vehicles.
If enacted, the #GreenNewDeal would leave American families on the hook for up to $65,000 a year for 10 years. Nearly 90 percent of all American assets, wealth, and property would need to be exchanged to pay this hefty price tag.
The #GreenNewDeal is perhaps the most expensive and economically disastrous legislation ever proposed. The total cost could be more than four times the annual value of all economic activity in the United States.

A return to bipartisan support for enhanced border security would go a long way toward improving our politics and protecting our nation. #WickerReport
In 2013, all 54 Democrats then serving in the U.S. Senate voted for an immigration reform package, which proposed $46 billion for border security  700 miles of border fencing. This bill did not pass the House but put @SenateDems on record.
In 2006, Congress and President George W. Bush enacted the “Secure Fence Act” with strong bipartisan support, including 26 @SenateDems. The bill authorized billions for physical barriers and border technology.
Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, @CBP continued to build physical barriers along high-traffic areas.  These efforts were supported by both chambers of Congress under the leadership of Republicans and Democrats.

There is no reason for Senate Democrats to continue this shutdown when many, including Sen. Schumer, have supported border walls and fences in the past. They now have an off-ramp to end this impasse and address some of our nation’s immigration challenges.
The President’s proposal gives Congress an opportunity to end the shutdown and secure the border. This bold plan is a good-faith offer to Democrats who have refused to work with the President to find a resolution.
