Too many Americans have lost loved ones to the gun violence epidemic. It’s time to take immediate action to save lives – which the Senate can do by voting to pass #HR8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. #enough
I applaud Governor Lujan Grisham for signing #SB8 into law today. Commonsense, bipartisan ideas like expanded background checks are a necessary part of the effort to #EndGunViolence.

Clearest sign that @realDonaldTrump’s #FakeTrumpEmergency is not legitimate? The President himself says he didn’t need to declare a national emergency – it’s just a faster way to force taxpayers to foot the bill after Congress wouldn’t let him have his way.
.@SenSchumer I call upon our Republican colleagues to join us to defend the Constitution. Read our full join statement here:
.@realDonaldTrump is not above the law. The Congress cannot let the President shred the Constitution.
.@realDonaldTrump’s emergency declaration, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, inconsistent with our Founders’ vision.
.@realDonaldTrump’s actions clearly violate the Congress’s exclusive power of the purse, which our Founders enshrined in the Constitution. The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in the Congress, in the Courts, and in the public, using every remedy available.
This is plainly a power grab by a disappointed President, who has gone outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process.
.@realDonaldTrump’s unlawful declaration over a crisis that does not exist does great violence to our Constitution and makes America less safe, stealing from urgently needed defense funds for the security of our military and our nation.
Democrats are sending legislation to the President’s desk to #KeepGovernmentOpen.
No child should be denied a loving home because the family that wishes to adopt them is LGBTQ or a religious minority. The Trump Admin must deny states’ unconstitutional waiver requests make sure child welfare stays at the heart of our state child welfare systems.
I applaud @RepSeanMaloney, @RepAngieCraig @RepKatieHill for leading the charge against the blatantly unconstitutional attempt to allow the GOP’s anti-LGBTQ, anti-Semitic anti-Muslim bigotry to take root in our foster adoption systems.
A year after America’s heart was broken by the horrific act of brutality violence in Parkland that stole 17 precious lives, we continue to be inspired by the persistence courage of the survivors and families who have turned their pain into action. #MSDStrong
The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.
.@realDonaldTrump couldn’t convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he’s trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it.
It is yet another demonstration of @realDonaldTrump’s naked contempt for the rule of law. This is not an emergency, and the President’s fearmongering doesn’t make it one.
Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that @realDonaldTrump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall.
