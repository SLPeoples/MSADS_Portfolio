Veteran suicide hits home in Montana. In 2016, 42 MT veterans lost hope and made an irreversible choice that may have been preventable. Thank you @realDonaldTrump for focusing our nation’s highest leaders on solving this tragedy.
Bit chilly.
Spent the morning at Bozeman Library for the Growing Up Smiling event with our next generation of dentists in Montana!
Some call it a polar vortex.  In Montana we call it Friday. (I wasn’t hit by a car). #stuckneighbor

@406Gigantes Ummm...actually I did.  Using a Browning Siloflex rod with auto reel...on a bitch creek fly, on the Sweet Grass, with my dad and grandpa.  Dad grew up in Billings, and graduated from Billings Senior, and U of MT.  He served in USMC while in school with John Bohlinge/Bob Hauck Sr
Early fly fishing days growing up in Montana.  Thankful for my outdoor heritage.  #bigtimber #oldschool

It's astounding to me that as a nation we even have to vote to stop born babies from being killed. I urge my colleagues to respect the dignity of life and to vote for this bill.
Tonight, the U.S. Senate will vote on @SenSasse's bill, the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Act. This bill protects babies, born alive, from being killed after birth. Plain and simple, this bill protects babies pure evil - infanticide.

@MaritsaNBCMT Montana proud!
It looked like there are two countries represented at last night’s SOTU — the United States and Venezuela.
Yes.
I agree with @realDonaldTrump, if we can’t agree on something so fundamental that babies born alive deserve the right to life, I fear deeply for the direction some are taking our country. We must pass @BenSasse born alive bill.
Under @realDonaldTrump’s leadership, we’ll continue to unlock Montana and America’s energy potential — putting America first as net exporters of energy. #SOTU
Prescription drug costs have skyrocketed and it’s unacceptable Montanans are struggling to afford the medications they need. @realDonaldTrump is right: we must continue to lower drug costs for Montanans and our nation. #SOTU
Trade is the future of ag in MT and our nation. We must ensure that our farmers and ranchers are able to compete on a level playing field overseas. I commend @realDonaldTrump for his leadership in putting US ag first and I will continue to work to reduce barriers to trade. #SOTU
.@realDonaldTrump is right – we must secure our borders. Mexican meth is flowing into Montana and tearing apart families and communities. It’s time for both sides to come to the table and do what’s right for our country. #SOTU
Under @realDonaldTrump and Republican leadership, our economy is booming. More money is staying in the pockets of hardworking Montanans, middle class income is at an all-time high, and thousands of jobs are being created in Montana and all over the country. #SOTU
My thoughts on #SOTU ️
And the night begins! Thank you for joining me tonight, Jodi. #SOTU
In May 2017, Broadwater County Deputy Sheriff Mason Moore was tragically killed in the line of duty. Tonight, I have the honor of bringing Mason’s wife, Jodi Moore, as my guest to @realDonaldTrump's #SOTU address.
Great pick! @DOIDepSec understands the importance of access to our public lands, responsible energy development and our trust responsibility to Tribal Nations. I look forward to continuing to work together on important issues to Montana and the West!

@realDonaldTrump wants to secure the border and open up the government, resolving the impasse.  Schumer’s latest position is not reasonable.  Zero wall funding?  It’s time to negotiate and move forward.
I’m disappointed to see @realDonaldTrump’s bipartisan proposal to open our government and secure our borders fail, especially when the Dems have voted on similar bills in the past. I stand ready to vote to open our gov, secure our borders and get our workers paid.

.@realDonaldTrump has put forward a good faith compromise that includes major priorities for both R’s and D’s. To my colleagues: we must put partisan politics aside, open the government and secure our borders.
Southern border is 1,954 miles long. @realDonaldTrump requested $5.7B for border security, repairing old barriers/adding 150 miles new.  ONLY 150/1954=8% of border covered with new wall, plus 654 miles of existing barriers.  Dems used to be for this until POTUS was for it. #facts

Since 1976, there have been 21 shutdowns.  Congress must do better. This bill lays out a reasonable, and constructive path forward.
We need to do more than vote on talking points. We need to vote on a real solution that @realDonaldTrump will sign, so we can open our government and secure our border.
