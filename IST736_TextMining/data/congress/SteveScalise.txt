With their diluted resolution yesterday, Democrats failed to condemn Rep. Omar for her anti-Semitic remarks, and they also conveniently failed to include condemning the death threats against many Republican members of Congress, including my own experience.
We've watched Democrats prioritize illegal immigrants over American citizens for a while now. But today they took it a step further by blocking our motion to prevent illegal immigrants from voting in elections—effectively devaluing the vote of legitimate voters.
Democrats are so focused on appeasing their radical base that they refused to work with @RepBrianFitz, a former FBI Special Agent and federal prosecutor who dealt with election crimes, on amendments to H.R. 1 that would clean up voter fraud and secure our elections.
Democrats promised a fair and open process. Yet this week they shut out Republicans entirely—this time on their bill to protect Democrat politicians by lining the pockets of their candidates with taxpayer money and making U.S. elections more susceptible to illegal voting.
Democrats once again sided with their radical base over the American people. This time they blocked the Republican motion to prevent illegal immigrants from voting in our elections. So much for election security.
It's clear why Democrats want H.R. 1, the "Democrat Politician Protection Act,” so badly. Illegal immigrants could be added to voter rolls and felons convicted of voter fraud will get the right to vote. That's outrageous, and it puts the security of our elections in jeopardy.

This diluted condemnation only highlights the real problem in the Democrat caucus: Speaker Pelosi awarded a known anti-Semite with a coveted spot on the Foreign Affairs Committee. My full statement ↓
RT @JudiciaryGOP: If #HR1 becomes law, it will be easier for illegal votes to cancel out the voice of legal voters.
Democrats claimed H.R. 1 would get money out of politics. But instead it's going to funnel billions of taxpayer dollars into the pockets of candidates and campaign consultants. How it works: if someone gives a campaign $100, the federal government will give that campaign $600.
H.R. 1, the "Democrat Politician Protection Act" enables voter fraud across the country by throwing out state laws that require people to show their ID and prove who they are before voting.
Congratulations to my friend and colleague @repdonyoung on becoming the longest serving Republican in the history of Congress! Honored to serve with you.
Republicans weren't consulted on H.R. 1, and Democrats once again voted down every single Republican amendment to the bill. It sets up a system of fraud, abuse, and misuse of taxpayer funds. Bottom line: H.R. 1 leaves the future and integrity of our elections in doubt.
Follow the money: H.R. 1 diverts taxpayer funds into candidates' and consultants' pockets by expanding the use of campaign funds to include child care and other personal expenses. Democrats are pursuing "reforms" that benefit themselves, not the American people.
After promising to run a transparent House, Democrats let special interest groups write a 622-page federal takeover of elections blatantly tailored to use taxpayer money to enrich candidates and campaign consultants with a 6 to 1 taxpayer-funded match of small dollar donations.
H.R. 1, the “Democrat Politician Protection Act" + Forces states to allow felons to vote+ Overrides state voter ID laws+ Removes safeguards to prevent voter fraud + Creates a system where taxpayer money funds candidates the taxpayer doesn't support

This is beyond a witch hunt. Democrats decided their end game before even looking at the facts. They never accepted the results of the 2016 election, and are now spending their time and taxpayer resources trying to appease their radical base by marching towards impeachment.
The resolution only addresses part of the issue. Rep. Omar continues to make anti-Semitic remarks. These are her beliefs. If Nancy Pelosi is serious about denouncing anti-Semitism supporting one of our strongest allies, she should remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee.
Had a great time riding on Bacchatality with the amazing people of New Orleans’ hospitality industry! #MardiGras �️
Resolutions are all well and good, but Speaker Pelosi is clearly afraid to stand up to Rep. Omar if she continues to reward her with a plum spot on the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Starting off the Mardi Gras season right at the Krewe of Muses in New Orleans
A new low for Democrats → By voting to make it harder for domestic violence victims to protect themselves from abusers, Democrats proved to the American people that they aren’t serious about preventing gun violence and are instead just interested in pushing their liberal agenda.
Every day in this country guns are used by good people to defend themselves against bad people and H.R. 8 is going to make it harder for them to get access to these guns. This is a bad gun control bill that does nothing but criminalize law-abiding citizens.
Democrats say there is an exemption for hunting in the bill, but it’s written so vaguely that if you want to loan your gun to a hunting buddy, you might need to bring along your attorney to find out if loaning a shotgun to your friend makes you a criminal.
Under this bill, a woman might have to wait 20 business days to get a gun to protect herself from domestic violence if the NICS system isn’t working. If she borrows a firearm for self-defense, the friend who loans her a gun would face a year in prison and up to a $100,000 fine.
I strongly oppose the gun control bills brought forward this week under the guise of background checks. Republicans identified many problems with this bill and the Democrat majority shut out almost every one of our solutions.
Democrats should just call Medicare For All what it is: a radical government-run, socialist health care program that forces 158 million Americans off their plans and costs taxpayers even more than Bernie Sanders’ $32 trillion dollar plan.

Every single day Americans use guns to defend themselves from criminals. That’s the intent of the 2nd Amendment. All Americans should have the right to protect themselves. But these Democrat gun control bills threaten that right.
The Democrat gun control bills we are voting on this week reveal the Democrats' radical leftist agenda. This legislation is just another step towards a national gun registry.
Democrats refused to let me testify at their gun control hearing because I won't spread their radical gun control message. But the American people deserve the truth: the Democrat gun control bills take away the rights of law-abiding citizens and make it harder to defend yourself.
The Democrat gun control bills will make criminals out of law-abiding citizens—yet they won’t allow an illegal immigrant who fails a background check while trying to buy a gun to be turned over to ICE. That’s disgraceful, and it shows their true intentions.
I’m joining The @IngrahamAngle on @FoxNews tonight to share my story and the truth about the Democrat gun control bill the House is voting on this week: it’s not a serious attempt to prevent gun violence, and instead aims to take away the rights of law-abiding U.S. citizens.
These are only a few of the real atrocities caused by illegal immigrant crime. Democrats calling this emergency fake owe an apology to #AngelFamilies and an explanation to the American people about what exactly their plan is to stop these preventable tragedies.
And just recently in Florida, an unborn child was killed by an illegal immigrant who then fled the scene of the crime.
In Speaker Pelosi's own backyard an illegal immigrant who had been deported multiple times recently shot at a sheriff’s deputy. How can Democrats ignore this?
How can Democrats call the crisis at our border fake when day after day we see heinous crimes committed by illegal immigrants against innocent Americans? It's not a fake crisis for the child molested by an illegal alien that snuck back into the country.
Democrats just voted to try to cancel the National Emergency @realDonaldTrump declared to secure our southern border. This is a slap in the face to our experts who put their lives on the line to protect our country and are pleading for more resources to combat the border crisis.
The Democrat gun control bill the House is voting on this week is more about taking rights away from law-abiding U.S. citizens than stopping gun violence.
You shouldn’t face a $100,000 fine and year in prison if you lend your pistol to a victim of domestic violence who needs to defend herself from someone she has a temporary restraining order against. But that’s what would happen under the Democrat gun control bill.
Democrats refused to listen to my testimony as a survivor of gun violence and supporter of the 2nd Amendment because they're only interested in hearing from liberal gun control advocates. But Americans deserve the truth about their gun control bill, so I won't stop speaking out.

Soon, every Democrat will have to go on record and tell the American people if they stand with most Americans who are against unchecked abortions, or if they stand with their radical base.
It’s no coincidence that more Americans have identified as pro-life over the past month as Democrats advocated for radical infanticide practices. This month, I started the process to force consideration on the House Floor of a bill to protect babies born alive during an abortion.
I will never stop fighting for the unborn. I recently joined with @RepAnnWagner to begin forcing a vote on the House Floor to protect babies born alive during abortions. Working closely with @realDonaldTrump, we're taking bold steps toward protecting innocent life at all stages.
Thanks to @realDonaldTrump’s leadership and the decision made by his administration today, we are finally ending the despicable practice of using taxpayer dollars to subsidize abortion providers under Title X, and are once again preserving the religious freedoms of all Americans.

It’s simple: deported illegal immigrants who committed crimes in the United States should not be able to come right back into our country unchecked. Yet Democrats refuse to provide our Border Patrol agents with the tools needed to prevent this from happening over and over again.
I’m joining @seanhannity on @FoxNews tonight. Tune in!
A deported child sex offender was able to illegally cross back into our country to potentially harm other kids in Louisiana. That’s outrageous. And it’s why @realDonaldTrump and Republicans are taking action to increase border security and build a wall.
Another day, another example of the crisis we face at our southern border. This is why @realDonaldTrump needed to take action to secure our border and protect American communities.
Democrats blocked an amendment to alert ICE when an illegal immigrant tries to purchase a gun and fails a background check. Why do they want to make it easier for criminals in the country illegally to get guns than law-abiding U.S. citizens?
Thank you @realDonaldTrump for standing with the Venezuelan people and Interim President Juan Guaido. The U.S. will continue to provide much needed humanitarian aid to #Venezuela. But Maduro’s socialist regime is using the military to block all aid from entering the country.

Fortunately, @realDonaldTrump made a promise to the American people to build wall in areas where drugs, human trafficking, and criminals flow freely into the U.S., and this deal ensures he has the flexibility and access to funds to build more wall and secure America’s border.
It’s a shame that Speaker Pelosi continues to ignore the recommendations of the brave men and women who risk their lives to protect our border, and refuses to support the full $5.7 billion requested for physical barriers.
I applaud @realDonaldTrump’s decision to sign this funding bill, as well as the steps he's taking to keep America safe. $1.375 billion in funding for 55 miles of badly-needed border wall is a big step, but clearly falls short of what Republicans wanted and what @POTUS requested.

If Democrats aren’t going to accept what experts say it will take to secure our border, they need to produce their own credible offer that stops criminals and drugs from entering our communities. @realDonaldTrump proposed multiple reasonable solutions. It's time they do the same.
A Louisiana fire chief, Spencer Chauvin, was killed by someone who is in this country illegally while responding to a call. I was honored to speak with his mother, and to share his story on the House floor. Lives are at stake. That’s why we need to secure our border.
Democrats need to put their money where their mouth is and negotiate in good faith now that the government is open. A negotiated compromise on border security must include funding for physical barriers along our southern border. The safety of our communities depends on it.
Rep. Cheri Bustos, DCCC Chair: “If we have a partial wall, if we have fencing, if we have technology used to keep our borders safe, all of that is fine…”
Rep. Collin Peterson, House Agriculture Committee Chairman: “Give Trump the money… I’d give him the whole thing…and put strings on it so you make sure he puts the wall where it needs to be. Why are we fighting over this? We’re going to build that wall anyway, at some time.”
Democrat leaders in their own words → Rep. Steny Hoyer, House Majority Leader: "Physical barriers are part of the solution"
Dozens of Democrats have claimed a barrier should be part of the border crisis solution should be negotiated on once the shutdown ended. @POTUS opened the government. Will they keep their word? Or allow Pelosi to cave to her party's open borders faction?
Nancy Pelosi said she wouldn’t negotiate with @realDonaldTrump on the wall until the government was back open. The government is now open. Will she finally come to the table with a real offer to properly secure our southern border, or continue fighting for open borders?

Thinking of my friend and colleague @RepWalterJones right now. My prayers are with you and your family.
During the next three weeks of this short-term agreement, Pelosi and Schumer need to stop playing partisan games and finally take serious steps to address the humanitarian and safety risks at the southern border while also reaching a long-term agreement on government funding.
One thing is clear from this last 35 days: Pelosi and Schumer would rather force the longest government shutdown in our history than fund border security that is critical to the safety of our nation.
Yet each time, Pelosi and Schumer refused to come to the table or even present a counteroffer. Now, once again, President Trump is exhibiting leadership by agreeing to re-open even though we still haven’t reached an agreement on border security.
Time and time again, President Trump proposed reasonable solutions that would open the government and secure our borders, while also including policies that Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer have previously supported.
Over the last month, Speaker Pelosi and liberals in Washington have put their personal differences with President Trump over the security of our border and the paychecks of federal workers.
Congratulations @PortNOLA on this accomplishment! This growth of trade through NOLA and along the Mississippi is why our work to deepen the Mississippi River Ship Channel is critical.
If Democrats are going to reject what experts tell us they need to secure our border, at some point they have to tell the American people what it is they are actually for, and put an offer on the table. Enough.
Now Democrats are rejecting @realDonaldTrump's offers before he even makes them. Stop the foolishness! The only way to solve this is to actually negotiate with each other. Until Democrats are willing to talk, progress is impossible.
Democrats claim to want open negotiations—but after a group of them went to meet with @realDonaldTrump, their own leadership said they weren't authorized to make a deal. It's clear: no Democrat is authorized to make a deal because they'd rather block @POTUS than find solutions.
Even several of Nancy Pelosi's House Democrats are acknowledging that a physical barrier is necessary to solve the crisis at our southern border. What will it take for Nancy Pelosi to put aside her commitment to obstructing @realDonaldTrump face reality? We need a border wall.
The reality: Democrats won't put up a dime for a wall that stops criminals drugs from pouring over our border—but instead passed a bill that sets aside taxpayer money for foreign organizations that provide abortions. They'll fund abortions, but not our security. #priorities
Today House Democrats for the third time voted AGAINST paying federal workers as negotiations continue. I asked the House Democrat Majority Leader a simple question: how can Democrats claim to support workers when they refuse to pay them and instead use them as political pawns?
The way out of this shutdown involves Nancy Pelosi putting her personal bias against @realDonaldTrump aside and coming to the table with a serious offer to solve the crisis at our southern border. So far she’s been unwilling to do that.
