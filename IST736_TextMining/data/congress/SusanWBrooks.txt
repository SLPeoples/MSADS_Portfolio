I continue to strongly stand against anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim sentiments, bigotry and hate in all forms. Read my complete statement here or on my website &gt;&gt;
Rep. Omar should be removed from the House Foreign Affairs Committee in order to send a strong message that we denounce anti-Semitic views in the House of Representatives.
But now, Democrats refuse to condemn, by name, a Democrat who has repeatedly made anti-Semitic statements. This is hypocritical and unacceptable.
Earlier this year, the House voted to condemn a Republican, by name, who made remarks supporting white supremacy and white nationalism. At that time, I applauded the decision by Republican leadership to remove Rep. Steve King from his cmte assignments b/c of his bigoted comments.
Representative Omar from Minnesota has repeatedly made anti-Semitic comments and while I voted for the Resolution before the House of Representatives, we must go farther.
There has been a significant rise in anti-Semitic acts in our country. I continue to strongly stand against anti-Semitism, anti-Muslim sentiments, bigotry and hate in all forms.
Anti-Semitic expressions or acts are hateful, intolerant and contradictory to the values that define the American people.
Working to ensure elections are secure free of fraud should be a #bipartisan effort. Instead, House Democrats advanced H.R. 1, which is a federal takeover of our election process, in a constitutionally questionable way without Republican input. Read my complete statement ️

I support the President’s national emergency declaration designed to strengthen our borders with additional border barrier systems as quickly and efficiently as possible.
There are already over 650 miles of barriers in place at the southern border. Apprehensions of people trying to illegally enter our country at these barrier locations have gone down dramatically.
Strong borders must be in place in order to keep the American people safe and the situation at our southern border can no longer be ignored.
While this is a humanitarian crisis that must be handled with compassion, this ongoing problem is overwhelming our resources to adequately address thousands upon thousands of people, particularly of children, who are coming to our border.
As I witnessed during my trip to the Texas border last year, we are seeing floods of families and unaccompanied children reaching our southern border in an attempt to illegally enter the Unites States.
The resolution the House passed today to end the President’s national emergency declaration undermines the statutory powers granted by Congress to the President to declare national emergencies.
Congress gave the President statutory authority to declare national emergencies. When Congress did so, they did not specifically define what can be designated as a ‘national emergency’ or not.

It continues to ensure safe healthy food on the tables of American families funds federal crop insurance programs that provide much needed stability to #Hoosier farmers.

What Congress passed today is more than just border security.
This deal increases the number of immigration judges so we can reduce the troubling case backlog. It builds safer communities by including resources for state/local law enforcement to address the #opioidcrisis, close sexual assault kit backlogs hire more police officers.
It further combats terrorists, espionage, drug traffickers, gangs violent criminals by increasing funding for U.S. Attorneys; U.S. Marshals; Drug Enforcement Administration; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms Explosives; the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
This package provides over $22 billion for improved border security, including physical barriers, needed equipment, technology personnel to keep our country safe.
It is government’s job to work together to fund the government I am proud we were able make progress find a #bipartisan compromise that keeps government open provides necessary funding to better secure our southern border.
