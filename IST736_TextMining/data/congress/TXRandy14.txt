Let’s be clear from the start – H.R. 1, the “For the People Act” is in reality a power grab and a thumb pressed to the scale. There is nothing fair about it. My full statement is posted here:
PSA: Dems are bringing a bill to the floor that hasn't even been 50% reviewed. Only one committee reviewed the bill. @HouseScience didn't get to review it, a critical portion of HR1 falls under SST jurisdiction. HR 1 isn't for the people, it's for power.
Blessings to the Hall family, his friends, and his former staffers… From WWII to the halls of Congress, Mr. Hall embodied service to our GREAT country. May he rest in
Great hearing!

Senate D’s kill (interesting word) the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act. Barbaric! Even on battlefield with worst enemies, if we take a wounded prisoner: don’t we give medical treatment to save them? But we won’t save innocent babies who survived attemps to kill them? GOD help
Happy Presidents’ Day, y’all...!
I’m 65 love America. In all my years I’ve never heard so much talk of Socialism. Everday, countless mice die because they don’t understand why the cheese is “free.” More folks get into suffer die in Socialism for same reason. Those wanting “free cheese” better wake up!

Here at the rally with other congressmen! There are huge crowds of people here and they are excited about helping President Trump make America great again. About securing our border for safety for our families. And about helping people to immigrate the legal way. Love it! #MAGA

GOD Bless America. Terrific end to a terrific speech, @realDonaldTrump! #USA #SOTU
The 75th anniversary of D-Day is coming up in June. Those brave, young soldiers knew their cause, they knew who they were there to help. Their story is one of courage and bravery. POTUS is right…They knew America had to prevail. Good always triumphs over evil.
Humbled to be here with Holocaust Survivors…we must never forget. Blessings to y’all…
Dems can’t even clap for the idea of being born free and founded on liberty and independence? That we will never be a socialist country? Hmm…
America first is a good thing. We should never apologize for protecting and advancing our interests at home and abroad.  #SOTU
Thank YOU, @realDonaldTrump for addressing the atrocities that occurred in the New York and Virginia legislators in recent weeks. ALL life is precious, and I, too, will never stop working to protect the unborn.
American freedom has allowed for scientific advances in HIV/AIDS, childhood cancer, more. We will not stop until these diseases are eliminated. I can’t help but think of the kindness shown by Former First Lady Barbara Bush and our local hero childhood cancer survivor, Mia.
A GREAT shared moment on the House floor. 100 years of women's right to vote, more women in the workforce, and more women serving in Congress than ever before! #USA #SOTU
It's simple... #WallsWork
Humanitarian assistance… more law enforcement…drug detection at ports of entry…closing of loopholes…plans for new physical barriers… all of these are common sense measures we’ve all agreed on in the past. What’s so different now? #SOTU
We must do something about this. Until then, people will continue suffering. Who are we to tolerate and allow this?
Sec. Nielsen announced today 2,000 migrants arrived in yet another caravan…their plan is to enter the border into Texas. This is unacceptable. POTUS hits the nail on the head with his assessment of our immigration crisis.
Glad to see we can ALL stand for criminal justice reform…I wish I could see the same for our veterans and for our energy dominance… #SOTU

Why do D's want to "fund" the govt only until Feb 08? To get past President's State of Union where he will expose their weakness on Natl Security at our border their unwillingness to care about Law Abiding Americans more than they do about illegals terrorists. Sad, huh?...rw
Do you remember... Under President Obama, all 54 Ds in the Democrat-controlled Senate voted to double the length of a new border fence with Mexico, double the number of border agents to 40,000, and spend $40 billion on border security.What changed…?
