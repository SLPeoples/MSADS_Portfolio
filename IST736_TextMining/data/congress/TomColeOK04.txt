In Oklahoma, where our election system is seen as highly successful and widely recognized, #HR1's proposed mandates would needlessly increase the cost of elections statewide and in every county.
#HR1 would disrupt and infringe upon the role states play in conducting their own elections. While some states are clearly more successful than others, it is alarming that Democrats want to force our 50 separate and unique states to operate under the same guidelines.
Today, the House voted on #HR1, a shameful Democratic power grab, which would essentially create a welfare program for politicians and candidates on the taxpayer dime. I opposed the bill.
The House is preparing to vote on #HR1. Earlier this week, I made remarks about why this is such an enormously misguided piece of legislation from Democrats.
This is an important forum for members. Earlier today, I appreciated having the opportunity to share my views and ideas for getting our nation’s long-term fiscal house in order.

As I said this morning on @NPR, @POTUS is acting well within his authority by declaring a national emergency at the southern border. Listen to my full interview:

I was shocked and deeply saddened to learn of the sudden passing of Bill Burgess of Lawton. Oklahoma has lost a leader of exceptional vision, energy, ability and character. And I have lost a dear friend I will always remember and miss for all my days.
I was very sad to hear about the passing of former Congressman John Dingell, a legendary figure in the House who served his constituents for nearly 60 years. My thoughts and prayers are with John’s wife @RepDebDingell, their family and many loved ones.
In stark contrast to the highly polarized and partisan political environment, @POTUS delivered an inspiring speech that sought to unify rather than divide. My full statement: #SOTU
RT @WhiteHouse: #SOTU night is here. Watch President @realDonaldTrump address the Nation LIVE at 9 p.m. ET:

Today, #WeRemember the millions of Holocaust victims and survivors. As we pause, we recognize the great importance of remaining united and vigilant in preventing future genocide.
In the weeks ahead, it is critical that Democrats stay true to their promise of working with Republicans and @POTUS on solutions for border security. I believe we can find a compromise that both sides agree on and which reflects the views of the American people.
Through his announcement today, @POTUS demonstrated yet again that he is willing to negotiate in good faith, and Democrats are now out of excuses for refusing to do so as well.
I am relieved that agreement has been reached to reopen the government and pay the hundreds of thousands of federal workers suffering as a result. Their commitment despite this hardship has been tremendous.

Great piece by @KatiePavlich disputing Speaker Pelosi’s misleading claim that strengthening border security is “immoral.” Worth a read.
His enduring belief and support of alliances and partnerships is an essential element of long-lasting peace and security, both at home and abroad. I am stunned and saddened by the news of his departure.
During his decades of extraordinary service and fearless leadership for our country, Secretary Jim Mattis has served with the utmost distinction and honor. The most revered Marine general in at least a generation and a living legend, his sense of duty is unmatched.

The Democrats’ decision to shut down the government is shameful and unacceptable. I will be in Washington, D.C. working with my colleagues to ensure the government opens again.
