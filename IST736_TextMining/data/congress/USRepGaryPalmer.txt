I'm speaking on the House floor today to ask for unanimous consent on HR 962, which seeks to protect newborn children from infanticide. This should be an easy "yes" vote. The right to life is fundamental to our country's values.

I could not in good conscience support HJRes31, because it increases spending in areas unrelated to national security when thousands are dying from drugs coming across our Southern border, others are suffering injuries death at the hands of people who came here illegally.
Today, the House passed my bill, the SAID Act. It would provide transparency accountability where there is currently no uniform standard for recordkeeping within federal agencies. Watch my speech on the House floor regarding the bill
Deeply saddened by Rep. Walter Jones’s passing. He was a man of honor, strong moral character, deep Christian faith, and high values. I’m honored to have been able to serve with him. Ann and I send our condolences and prayers to his family.

On the other hand, I think Rod Rosenstein has not represented the DOJ well, especially regarding Congressional oversight and document production. This is what I told the CNN reporter; CNN reinterpreting my comments for the sake of headlines is the very definition of fake news.
As it stands, Jeff Sessions is doing his job when the only leaks are coming from those being investigated. While I share the President’s concerns about the Russia investigation and believe it should end, Jeff Sessions is recused from that.
A recent CNN news story mischaracterized my trust in Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He has my full trust and I think he's done an excellent job in de-politicizing the DOJ. The DOJ has many ongoing investigations and Jeff Sessions will ultimately be judged by their outcomes.

We must continue supporting our intelligence agencies as they protect us from those who would undermine our nation. Further, the 2016 election was not ultimately undermined. President Trump should take satisfaction that the American people elected him despite Russia's efforts.
Our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russia was successful only in hacking the DNC server. I'm glad President Trump has admitted he misspoke at the press conference I encourage him to evaluate the current situation as Russia continues to try to divide us.
Putin is clearly a ruthless leader determined to make Russia a feared nation. I'm sure his operatives tried to influence the 2016 election, as confirmed by the CIA congressional investigations. But this shouldn't be confused with collusion between Russia Trump's campaign.

Congress held a special ceremony today to honor MLK Jr.’s life, marking the 50th anniversary of his death. He believed in justice and in advancing the cause through love instead of hate.
