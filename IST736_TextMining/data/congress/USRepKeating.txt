This week we’re going to introduce legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and restore net neutrality. We're also going to pass H.R. 1 – the For the People Act to work to restore the American people’s faith in our government. #VAWA #NetNeutrality
Last week we passed two common-sense gun safety bills, voted to terminate the President’s emergency declaration, and we introduced legislation to restore the Voting Rights Act.
The new Democratic majority was sent to Washington with a mandate to govern – and that’s exactly what we’re doing:
.@JunckerEU declares 25% of EU budget will go to mitigate climate change. Our friends in Europe again take two steps forward while we take two back.  The US should be leading the fight against climate change, not focusing energies trying to debunk science.
Barnstable County Commissioner Ron Beaty’s hateful comments have no place in public discourse and are a disservice to the open and accepting community that so many have worked so hard to create on Cape Cod.
We also had the opportunity to join @SpeakerPelosi for a meeting with EUCOM NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gen. Scaparrotti. Glad to be here with my Massachusetts friend and colleague @RepLynch.
Great to meet with Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs @cafreeland with @SpeakerPelosi and colleagues at @MunSecConf.

I am attending the Munich Security Conference as part of the congressional delegation led by @SpeakerPelosi and in my role as Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Europe, Eurasia, Energy, and the Environment Subcommittee.
RT @usbotschaft: .@SpeakerPelosi, @RepEliotEngel, @RepStephenMeeks,@USRepKeating, and @GerryConnolly met with #German FM @HeikoMaas while a…
I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the #GreenNewDeal Resolution led in the House by @AOC and in the Senate by @SenMarkey. The time to act on the climate crisis is so long overdue. Communities like ours have seen signs of what is to come if we don’t address this emergency.
I look forward to leading important work in the House of Representatives to reaffirm our NATO membership and am confident that oversight over President Trump's impulsive decisions on this critical security issue will be vigorously pursued here in Congress.
Withdrawing from NATO would create one of the most dangerous security voids of our lifetimes serving only to empower those who would strive to weaken the United States and undermine the world order the we have spent the last half of the twentieth century building with our allies.
NATO is a cornerstone of our efforts to keep Americans safe here at home and let us not forget that NATO Article 5 has only been invoked once in its history - in the collective defense of the United States after 9/11.
The President's willingness to discard our longstanding NATO alliance without consulting Congress or our allies is disturbing. That there was discussion of this prospect alone is alarming, damages our credibility with our European allies, and leaves us less secure.
I am proud to join on as a co-sponsor of #HR8 today and stand with all survivors of gun violence whose lives might be different had we had smart gun laws already in place.
Rep. Giffords was also in Washington for the announcement of H.R. 8 – “To require a background check for every firearm sale” which was introduced by a bipartisan group of five Democrats and five Republicans.
Gabby is a hero – and it was my great honor to be able to convey that message this morning when I spoke with her outside the newly-dedicated Gabrielle Giffords-Leo J. Ryan Cloakroom at the Capitol.
In the years since that awful Saturday in January, our nation has had a front row seat to see how special Rep. Giffords truly is. Her recovery has been an inspiration, and she has been a leader in the fight for sensible gun reform.
I had only been in Congress for 5 days when @GabbyGiffords was shot while meeting with constituents. I hadn’t had the chance to get to know her yet, but I immediately learned from other Members who knew her well what a committed legislator and thoughtful colleague she is.
The reality of the #TrumpShutdown is that the DHS, TSA, and DOJ employees responsible for protecting us are working without pay because the White House is placing politics ahead of our safety.
2,170 people whose names were in the Terrorist Screening Database were encountered at U.S. airports in 2018. 2,265 people on this list purchased firearms between 2004 and 2015. #TrumpShutdown
The Department of Homeland Security has many responsibilities and contributing to the Terrorist Screening Database is one of them. This is the database that TSA uses for the “No-Fly List” and the database that the Department of Justice checks against gun purchases. #TrumpShutdown
On a personal note, I was excited to return to Washington this week for the first time since my successful eye surgery last month. I am very grateful for the outpouring of well wishes from constituents.
Serving the Commonwealth and our nation is one of the greatest privileges of my life and I’m looking forward to working during the 116th Congress to advance the interests important to Southeastern Bay Staters and citizens across the country.
I was proud to join the new majority in voting to re-open the government and I am also proud to support and co-sponsor HR 1. These two pieces of legislation are what the citizens of this county want. It is the message they sent in November.
Thursday was a great day for our nation - Speaker Pelosi took the gavel to preside over a new majority and the most diverse Congress in history with her grandchildren and the children of many other members by her side. I was able to grab this picture from my seat on the floor.
Secretary of Defense Mattis’ resignation letter makes it clear his departure was a direct result of President Trump’s worldview and policy. His departure will create even more uncertainty during a time when our allies and coalition partners are questioning US leadership.
This will have broad negative consequences for our allies on the ground, as well as risk humanitarian gains in ISIS-liberated areas in Syria. This policy should immediately be re-evaluated. (2/2)
President Trump tweeted an order withdrawing all our troops deployed in Syria without senior military, diplomatic, Congressional, or Coalition input and notification. (1/2)
The @DeptVetAffairs budgeted $6.2mil for suicide prevention outreach in 2018 and only $57k had been spent by September. @USGAO says it's because of vacancies in leadership positions, meanwhile 20 vets commit suicide each day. Unacceptable on all counts.
Congress has a responsibility to take action. #SandyHook
In January a part of the problem will be fixed - after six years of Republicans refusing to bring common-sense bills to the floor for debate, Democrats will take the majority and restore the democratic process by allowing debate on meaningful, sensible gun legislation.
As we take time to remember the twenty-seven victims lost at Sandy Hook Elementary six years ago today we must also acknowledge that Congress has failed to act for six years. This Cape Cod Times editorial is spot on: something is broken.
For all of these reasons, and because I believe climate change is one of the greatest threats we are currently facing, I enthusiastically support the ideals expressed in the #GreenNewDeal and am excited to review legislation to move this forward in the new Congress.
We see that in the hundreds of jobs that will be created building the first of its kind wind farm off the coast of our country. We see it in new solar businesses. And we see it in the research coming out of Woods Hole and SMAST.
Since that time, I have been working to combat climate change and expand the blue and green economies here in Southeastern Massachusetts making us a hub of new, clean technology.
When I was a new Member of Congress, one of my first district visits was to tour the seawalls along our towns on the South Shore.
I was unable to be in Washington for votes because I recently had surgery to correct a macular hole in my eye and am still in Bourne recovering. I look forward to returning to my regular schedule very soon and in the meantime will continue to work from home through my recovery.
In fact, when recently asked about our arms deals with Saudi Arabia and their involvement in the Khashoggi killing and the war in Yemen, I stated: “This is not an economic issue. We’re a country that is founded on ideas and ideals. We’re not a country founded on arms sales.”
Without question, I would have joined with my colleagues in the Massachusetts delegation to advance legislation on the war in Yemen had I been in DC.
A grateful nation thanks you, @GenDunford , and Massachusetts looks forward to welcoming you home.
@GenDunford has been a frequent presence in SE MA, including recent visits to Fall River for the unveiling of the Gold Star Families memorial and to Pembroke to honor Lt. Brian McPhillips USMC and PFC Matthew Bean, US Army, both Pembroke residents who made the ultimate sacrifice.
@GenDunford is currently the highest-ranking and most senior military officer in the United States Armed Forces and has served in many roles including as Commandant of the  Marine Corps.
Today’s announcement by the President that @GenDunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is retiring marks the final chapter of the long, distinguished career of a  Quincy native.
Every day there are less and less of these service members, and that is a tragedy as they represent what is truly great about America. Their service has inspired generations of Americans to follow their lead in service to our country. We will always owe them a debt of gratitude.
As we just laid to rest President George H.W. Bush, a true hero of the Greatest Generation, let us remember all his brothers and sisters who defended our country during the attack on Pearl Harbor.
The United States would be a better place with more men and women like George H.W. Bush in government.
Born in Massachusetts, President Bush was a Navy man who dedicated his life to public service, and he was one of the most distinguished experts on foreign policy in our history. After his Presidency he was a respected and moderating voice on important issues facing our nation.
My condolences to President George W. Bush and the Bush family on the passing of President George H.W. Bush.
My thoughts and prayers remain with Sgt Emond's wife, children, and family, as well as with the families of our other two fallen heroes, Army Captain Andrew Ross and Air Force Staff Sgt Dylan Elchin. God bless them. May they Rest In Peace.
Sgt Emond was a recipient of two Purple Hearts and three Bronze stars over his twenty-one years of service in the Marines and Army, he had already given so much to his community and his country.
This week, we lost three American heroes in Afghanistan. One of these losses hits our community particularly hard - Sgt 1st Class Eric Emond was a native of Fall River, graduate of Durfee High School, and co-founder of @MAFallenHeroes - a nonprofit that helps gold star families.
The President’s tweets are focused on troops stationed at the US-Mexico border with no active role. Meanwhile Russian provocation on the Black Sea - in violation of International Law - is met with silence.Where are this President’s priorities?
Applying for asylum is not a crime. It is time to act like an independent congress and pass comprehensive immigration reform.
We all have something to be thankful for today - and appearing high on all of our lists should be the men and women stationed here at home and abroad to protect us - their sacrifice means that they won’t be with their families today so that we can be with ours. Happy Thanksgiving
There is no moral equivalency between premeditated murder and money from arms sales. There should be no currency for the sale of America’s soul. I will work to sanction Saudi Arabia and hopefully be joined by congressional colleagues.
Political leaders must end hateful rhetoric that serves no purpose other than to divide us as a country.  And Congress must act and put forth responsible and commonsense gun control measures that are designed to make us safer.
As we pray for the victims and all those affected, we also must pledge to do whatever we can as a Congress and as a nation to do end this senseless violence.
Today’s tragic mass shooting at a Pittsburg synagogue comes on heels of African-Americans being targeted by a killer in Kentucky and bombs being sent to public officials and news media.
Before going home for good ahead of the midterms House Republicans are playing dangerous political games with the Mueller investigation on behalf of Trump.
I’m as proud of Dr. Ford as I am disappointed with the institution of the US Senate.
As a former District Attorney who has worked with victims of sexual assault, I realize the excruciating and retraumatizing nature of sharing the type of experience Dr. Ford has disclosed. I cannot begin to understand doing that on a national stage.
Yet, for a lifetime appointment to one of our nation’s most important positions, federal investigators are not being allowed to do this. That outrage is only matched by the courage of Dr. Ford in coming forward.
I was fortunate to be able to pay my way through college working for the Post Office. For that job, federal investigators conducted a background check, even going door to door in the neighborhood I grew up in and asking residents what they knew of me.
First and foremost, Tevis and I send our condolences to the family of Arthur Medici, the victim of yesterday's shark attack. Going forward, I will be convening meetings w/the National Park Service and coordinating w/state and local officials on how best to address this issue.
L’Shana Tova to all who are celebrating today. May your new year be happy, healthy, and sweet.
On August 25, 2009, we lost the Lion of the Senate, Ted Kennedy. Today, nine years later, we lost another pillar of the United States Senate in John McCain. A grateful nation thanks him. May he Rest In Peace.
The President’s decision to punish @JohnBrennan because he doesn’t like what he says about him puts our nation at risk, plain and simple.
It has been standard practice for former CIA Directors to maintain their security clearance so that their successors can seek their guidance during times of crisis.
When you next see a first responder, please thank them. They risk their lives everyday to protect us, a fact that our communities are all too aware of.
I visited with Chief Dunne and his officers this morning and was relieved to hear from him that both injured officers are expected to recover, and one was released from the hospital last night. Thank God.
My thoughts are with the two officers shot in Falmouth last night. We can only imagine the horror that they have experienced along with their families and colleagues.
Every Member of Congress – Democrat, Republican, or Independent – who stands by silently after today is complicit.
President Trump’s actions are an immediate threat to our national security.
He has done more than just embarrass our country by not holding Putin accountable and refusing to denounce Russia for its interference in our elections.
Trump discarded evidence from our national security experts, dismissed our rule of law, and utterly failed in his responsibilities as our Commander in Chief.
It was impossible to distinguish his words from Russian propaganda.
Today, the President of the United States stood next to the person who directed an attack on our country and instead of standing tall for America, he blamed us and our past leadership for Russia’s aggression.
It was impossible to distinguish Trump’s words today from Russian propaganda.
I didn’t know Officer Chesna personally, but I had the privilege of working closely with the men and women of the Weymouth Police Department as District Attorney and they are among the best. I extend my condolences to Officer Chesna’s brothers and sisters at WPD as well.
Today’s loss of Officer Michael Chesna is another sad reminder of the risks that our public safety officers take each and every day to protect us. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends.

One of the greatest joys of my life has been being a dad to two great children. To all the fathers, grandfathers, uncles, and father-like figures, Happy Father's Day.
We see the pictures of terrified children separated from their families on newspapers across the country. This is not who we are - but if we don’t join together to stand up against this cruelty, it is exactly who we will become.
I’m grateful to these four statesmen who were able to look beyond President Trump’s ridiculous trade war to help the thousands of Massachusetts families who depend on the local cranberry industry.
I was happy to come to common agreement with President Macron, EU Ambassador O’Sullivan, German Ambassador Wittig, and French Ambassador Araud over the proposed retaliatory tariffs on cranberries.
Incredibly moving moment at Marshfield High School's graduation ceremony this weekend. God bless our service men and women and their families that wait for them at home.
Today is an opportunity for quiet reflection to remember the service men and women who gave all and are buried at home and around the world, and a chance to offer gratitude for the sacrifices made for our nation by their mothers, fathers, daughters, and sons.
My grandmother was a Gold Star mother, and I have always been committed to the ideal that our best opportunity to honor the memory of the fallen is by supporting the families left behind.
On Memorial Day we honor the members of the United States Armed Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We must never forget that we owe our freedom to these brave women and men who served and gave all in defense of our nation.
Once again, we must ask: When will Speaker Ryan allow this Congress to do something to protect our kids and citizens so we can come together and say never again?
Once again, I continue to pledge my commitment to common-sense gun safety laws.
Once again, my prayers are with the victims, their families, and all those affected today in Santa Fe at yet another school shooting.
The Senate just voted to reinstate #NetNeutrality rules. As a cosponsor of the House version of this bill, I am urging Speaker Ryan to bring it to the floor for a vote.
Proud to stand in solidarity with the men and women of IBEW 1499 at the Philips plant in Fall River. #UnionStrong
This morning I joined @SenWarren, @SenMarkey, @JonMitchellNB and members of the New Bedford fishing community to discuss offshore wind and the Sector IX closure.
My statement on POTUS's #IranDeal Announcement:
My condolences to Lana's family, friends, and her @WBZnewsradio and @WBZ family, who are already having an incredibly tough month with the losses of Tony Pepper, Charlie Austin, and Gil Santos.
Lana Jones knew everyone, and everyone who knew Lana knew her to be smart, kind, thorough, and great at her job. I had the pleasure of being interviewed by her many times over the years and I can say with certainty that Boston has lost one of its best reporters.
For a man born and married on Patriots Day, Gil Santos was the consummate New Englander. He will be sorely missed.
There are plenty of New Englanders who muted the TV broadcasts in big games and high leverage moments in favor of his calls with partner Gino Cappelletti. From the Snow Bowl to Super Bowl XXXVI to his final call in January of 2012, his voice is etched into our collective memory.
For thirty-six years, Fairhaven native Gil Santos was the voice of the New England Patriots. The model of reliability - missing only one game in his years with the Pats - Santos narrated many of the Patriots moments we hold dearest.
Like our own Abigail Adams, Barbara Bush will not simply be remembered as the wife and mother of Presidents, but also as a strong woman in her own right, wholly dedicated to her family and country.
I firmly believe that there is no greater love than giving up one’s life for another. We are honored and humbled to have been served by Officer Gannon, a hero who sacrificed his life in the protection of our community.
Our most heartfelt prayers go out to Officer Sean Gannon’s wife Dara, his family, and the men and women who served at his side.
Medal of Honor recipient, and Fall River native, Capt. Thomas Hudner was laid to rest today in Arlington National Cemetery. A remarkable man - not many people get a Naval Destroyer named after them - he set a standard for heroics few can rise to. Rest in Peace Capt. Hudner.
Like many who came of age in the 60's, I still remember where I was when we learned of Dr. King's assassination. In the 50 years since, his work continues, as we strive “to make America what it ought to be.” We continue his fight because this country is worth the trouble. #MLK50
President Trump is taking us backwards.
And Massachusetts has been a leader in treatment and prevention nationwide. While interdiction and law enforcement have a place, the narrow approach that dominated the President’s remarks today simply won’t work.
That is why the Centers for Disease Control advocates for an approach of combining medically assisted and behavioral health treatment as the best course.
Back then, I was tasked with the responsibility of approaching it from a criminal side, but I learned this is much more a public health issue.
Over a decade and a half ago as Norfolk County District Attorney, I started an Opioid Task Force, and what I learned from my experience is that the President has it all wrong.
Tevis I are saddened to hear of Rep. Louise Slaughter's passing. Tevis Louise shared Kentucky roots Louise was a great combination of Kentucky grit New York tenacity. Her enormous enthusiasm passion for her job never wavered. Our condolences to her family staff.
When asked about the State Dept. last year, Trump said he is “the only one that matters" on foreign policy. As long as he believes that, the country is ill-served regardless of who is Secretary of State.
It's outrageous that my Republican colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee stand completely at odds with our nation's top intelligence agencies who concluded Russia attacked our election system to help Donald Trump. Partisanship has trumped patriotism.
Nantucket residents have shown they refuse to be indifferent. I join with everyone in this community in saying there is no place on this island – or anywhere – for hatred and racism.
This response reminds me of the words of Elie Wiesel: the opposite of love isn’t hate, it’s indifference.
I spoke with Charity Grace Lambert, director of Nantucket’s African Meeting House, who told me of the outpouring of support she’s received from so many on the island.
Good luck to Mike Trapp from Marstons Mills who will be competing tonight (Saturday morning, South Korean time) in the Giant Parallel Slalom.  We’re with you, Mike! #winterolympics #snowboarding #bestofus
There are no more questions; no witch hunt. It happened. Russia interfered in our last election. And they are still doing it. Time for some of my colleagues to stop denying and start protecting our country.
This is not who we are. This must end.
Our nation owes a debt to these families and to all of those who suffered from preventable mass shootings. The sooner we satisfy that debt, the sooner we will help to ensure that tragedies of this scale never happen again.
My heart goes out to the families of the Marjory Stoneham Douglas High School and all of South Florida. The tragedy laid upon them today will undoubtedly redefine their lives forever.
Let's go Pats! #NotDoneYet #BlitzforSix
Wray was appointed by Trump, as was Rosenstein and Boyd – all of whom opposed releasing this memo. If there is a conspiracy against Republicans and this Administration, as President Trump wants everyone to believe, then it is being led by his own appointees.
Special Counsel Mueller’s investigation into the Russian attack on our country, including possible involvement by the Trump Campaign, must continue unimpeded.
Having read both Nunes and Democrats’ memo, the only reason to release the Nunes memo is to undermine the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller and/or to attempt to justify firing him or other Department of Justice officials.
Congratulations to my friend @RepJoeKennedy and to a great crowd in Fall River on a forward looking speech with a positive vision for our country's future. #SOTUResponse
Our national security was weakened tonight as a result of the action of the Republican members of the the House Intelligence Committee.
Please join me in keeping the safety and security of the roughly 15,000 American women and men serving in Afghanistan in your thoughts and prayers. Yesterday’s bombing in Kabul that killed 85 when an ambulance exploded is a tragic reminder of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan.
Coming from a family of public servants, it is not surprising that Cecile Richards has spent her life helping others and fighting to protect their rights. She is a true champion for women’s empowerment and her legacy - at Planned Parenthood and beyond - will last for generations.
Congress has a constitutional responsibility to hold the Executive Branch accountable, and tonight’s @nytimes report is one of the most important developments yet to support an independent investigation. It’s time for my GOP colleagues to stop undermining this investigation.
President Trump and the Republican Congressional leadership are orchestrating this shutdown to avoid dealing with issues that are critical to our country, including funding healthcare for more than 9 million children and protecting
Proud to stand with Pastor Aguy and Cape Haitian-Americans at Canaan Bilingual SDA Church in Hyannis this AM. Discrimination against anyone is discrimination against everyone, and it is vital that we make sure our neighbors know we stand with them  in light of POTUS comments.
Trump's disparaging comments about other nations during the DACA negotiations are beneath the office of the Presidency. They don't reflect the values and opinions of Americans, and he should apologize immediately.
On #NationalLawEnforcementAppreciationDay we recognize hard working men and women, like my father, brother and niece, who protect us every day. I have been honored to work with many great local and federal law enforcement officers as D.A. and in Congress - Thanks for all you do.
Wishing a Happy Peaceful New Year to all as I look forward to continuing our work together in 2018.
POTUS's decision to fire remaining members of the HIV/AIDS council sends a concerning message. We should be advancing the fight to eradicate this disease. The US is becoming a backseat player on some of our world's most challenging issues. 
In an America that values fairness, this fails. #RepublicanTaxBill
Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the two fishermen whose bodies were recovered today off of Nantucket.
Praying for everyone affected by the horrific train derailment in Washington State and all the first responders working to save and treat victims.
The FCC voted to repeal #netneutrality rules - a clear attack on consumer protections. Quick, affordable access to the internet that is free open is essential. Shame on our Admin. officials who are clearly doing the bidding of big business as opposed to putting citizens first.
I am struggling to find the right words on this 5 year anniversary of Sandy Hook. Those children should be enjoying their first year of middle school. My heart is still broken for the families. We owe it to them to have a good faith conversation about ending gun violence.
The strength of our country - an informed, engaged people exercising our  democratic rights and values - on clear display last night in Alabama.  America wins. Let us continue.
Good luck to @dolphinathletic @SachemStudents @MashpeeFootball at Gillette today! Let's bring those Super Bowl trophies back to #MA09!
Designating North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism is a critical piece of what must be a comprehensive US strategy for addressing the Kim regime's destabilizing and dangerous agenda.
My thoughts and prayers are with the Sailors onboard the transport flight that crashed off the coast of Japan today. Hoping for a quick resolution to the status of the three who remain missing at this hour, and a speedy recovery to all involved.
This weekend, Afghan women ran in the Bamiyan Marathon...This month, I met with former First Lady Laura Bush Afghanistan’s First Lady Rula Ghani on programs to strengthen women’s freedom participation in that

POTUS's words demonstrate a moral compass where north is south, east is west.We must be of one course as a country-to condemn hate racism.
My thoughts are with all those injured today in Charlottesville.
It has become a beacon for all and we will continue to endure in those beliefs regardless of those who wish to destroy our values.
America does not belong to one race or ethnicity or group.
Hatred and violence have no place in our society, but the white supremacy marches yesterday and today go beyond that.
The recklessness of the President's statement on North Korea yesterday is undercutting diplomacy and putting us all in danger.
Simply stated, MA is a better place thanks to @nikiinthehouse's lifetime of service. Proud to call her a friend.
Today's POTUS anti-transgender tweets are repugnant. To the est.15,000 currently serving: I value you, I support you, I will fight for you.
John McCain is an American hero and a colleague on foreign affairs issues. He and his family are in our thoughts and prayers.
My prayers are with the families of the Marines Sailor who tragically lost their lives yesterday in Mississippi.
