Today, my colleague and good friend, @RepAnnWagner, asked for unanimous consent to bring up the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. But once again, my liberal colleagues rejected it. Like I've said before, this should NOT be a partisan issue. #ProLife
It's absolutely appalling that Democrats refuse to support the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This should not be a partisan issue. #ProLife
In the words of @SpeakerPelosi, it's the green dream. #GreenNewDeal
Medicare for all is just another liberal idea that will cost hardworking Americans trillions of dollars. If Democrats think it's such a great plan, they should have no issue holding a hearing and answering the hard questions.
Yes, yes we are. #GreenNewDeal
#GreenNewDeal highlights: ️ Costs trillions of dollars ️ Eliminates air travel ️ Requires EVERY SINGLE building in the U.S. to be upgraded or replaced ️ Provides economic security for those UNWILLING to work??How is this a win for the American people?
