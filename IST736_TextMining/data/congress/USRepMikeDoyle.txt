Background checks keep guns out of the wrong hands. The #CharlestonLoophole allows someone to obtain a firearm if their background check isn’t completed within 3 days. #HR1112 would extend that period by a few days for the few sales which need more time. I am voting for it today!

In PA, the #LWCF has funded over 1,500 projects - and its reauthorization helps to preserve our #PublicLands. This bill also funds the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area, creates a new National Heritage Area, and extends the Lewis and Clark National Trail to #PGH.
Today’s #PublicLands Package would designate 1.3 million acres of new wilderness, protect one million acres of public lands from mining, permanently reauthorize #LWCF and #MSCF, and save taxpayers $9 million!

@POTUS promised to sign bill the Senate passed UNANIMOUSLY, but shut down govt over Wall he said Mexico’d pay for. Law enforcement officers other govt employees working w/o pay - many others sent home w/no pay. Dems want effective border security but won't waste $ on his Wall.

The difference between Democrats and Republicans in Congress couldn’t be clearer. Republicans want to cut taxes for the wealthiest "1 Percent" – while Democrats want to preserve the health and retirement programs that working families have earned and deserve.
Not coincidentally, last year Congressional Republicans cut taxes for corporations and the wealthiest “1 Percent” by $2 Trillion over the next 10 years as well.
If Republicans succeed in cutting $2 Trillion from Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and the ACA, they will hurt over 67 Million households across the country, including more than half of all households in Pennsylvania and in PA’s 14 Congressional district, which I represent.
Congressional Republicans don’t just want to repeal the #ACA; As the 2019 budget introduced by House Republicans shows, they want to cut $2 Trillion in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security as well over the next 10 years.
