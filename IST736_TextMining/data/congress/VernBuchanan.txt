Against my strong objections, the U.S. House just voted to strip protections for the endangered Gray Wolf. Scientists and conservation experts should manage wildlife recovery, not Washington politicians. Fortunately the bill will not clear the Senate.

Honored to receive a 100 percent grade from @HumaneSociety for my record this year defending wildlife and preventing animal cruelty. Protecting threatened species like the manatee and Florida panther should be a bipartisan issue important to all of us.
Today’s shooting at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh is a vile act of hatred that has no place in our country. Anti-Semitism cannot be tolerated anywhere, anytime.
The person responsible for this appalling attack targeting former President Obama and others should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Acts of political terrorism like this cannot be tolerated.
A decision by the Interior Dept. to weaken oil rig safeguards must be reversed. After the devastation of red tide, the last thing we need is another massive oil spill like Deepwater Horizon.

After reports of misconduct at VA nursing homes surfaced, I called for a congressional inquiry. I’m pleased to report that a U.S. House committee has decided to investigate. Heads must roll for anyone who mistreated our aging veterans.
Russia is not our friend. There is no dissent inside U.S. intelligence agencies about the conclusion that Russia interfered in the presidential election. We need to take steps to prevent such interference in the future.

Gina Haspel should be confirmed as the first woman head of the CIA. She is tough, experienced and backed by former Obama intelligence officials. The fact that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, mastermind of 9-11 attacks, opposes her nomination even more reason.
The Iran nuclear deal is one of the worst and most one-sided transactions in U.S. history. President Trump was right to withdraw. Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and has a history of cheating on international arms inspections.
Congress should reject a White House plan to cut funding from the Children’s Health Insurance Program. There are plenty of other places to cut. Eleven years ago I voted to override then-President Bush’s veto of a bill extending the program.
A new study ranked me one of the most bipartisan members in Congress -- top 15 percent in U.S. House. Nothing is impossible if we work together. We need more civility and less partisanship in Washington.
