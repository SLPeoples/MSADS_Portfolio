@chemsmith Scholarships are also common. I'll skip the insult.
Employers could grow faster, but consistently say they face worker shortages for skilled trades and significant skills gaps. Meanwhile, #OH08 has great career technical+STEM education and abundant apprenticeships. I spoke with one who was only 20 y/o making $24/hr - with $0 debt.
It juices current consumption of education, but crowds out future consumption. Burdened with debt by graduation, these students are delaying consumption that has historically driven our economy. Cars, marriage, homes, kids... Lastly, the artifical demand has skewed the workforce.
Combine easy money, low consumer education on risk of default, no price discovery, and artificial demand for 4-year degrees and you get massive tuition inflation. This not only hurts consumers, it is also a massive wealth transfer from the rest of the economy to education.
Consequently, a student can go just as deeply into debt regardless of major, job prospects, risk of default (expected ability to repay), at the same interest rate. Private lenders refinance the high-credit, employed graduates at lower rates because their risk of default is lower.
Business loans work better b/c the government is not the dominate player with artificial rates. An interest rate consists of two parts: time value of money and default risk. Federal student loans are at fixed rates, with no price discovery on rate, and limited borrower education.
Student debt is a real problem, but more FREE stuff is not the solution. I have met people with millions of dollars in business loans. That is crazy! "Small businesses create jobs, so we have got to make business loans free with no expectation of repayment" - said no one EVER.

@BradCromes @innovationohio Why do you want illegal residents to receive payments from the US Treasury? Regardless, my amendment doesn't prevent counting non-citizens. It requires that only citizens are counted for apportionment of representation. 435/citizens instead of 435/population.

Fair Representation is a nonpartisan effort to ensure that only citizens are counted for apportionment of representation. For example, both California and Texas have more non-citizens than Ohio. Partisan opposition; however, seems to indicate @DNC benefits from the status quo.

I'm very confused by this position from R Street. A primary purpose of patents is to prevent others from unjustly taking intellectual property. The author may as well have cited the general welfare clause and demanded eminent domain to take from Qualcomm.
@2tonetony50 Do you mean since the passage of the National Emergencies Act in 1976?Some argue that bill actually limited executive authority by being more specific. SCOTUS essentially expanded the Act in with a 1983 decision that limited Congress's check on presidential actions IAW the Act.
