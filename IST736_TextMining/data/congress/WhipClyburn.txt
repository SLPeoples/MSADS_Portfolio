If the president is truly serious about creating a bipartisan environment, he will never use federal workers as pawns to get his way ever again.

Bipartisanship means real smart border security solutions like sensors and drones, not a medieval edifice.
Instead of creating policies to uplift the middle class, the president created a tax law that benefited the wealthiest 1% and corporations at their expense.
The president cannot continue to turn a blind eye to climate change. We must work together to create new infrastructure and jobs in clean energy so that we can begin to reverse the damage already done before it is too late.
Companies have spent $1 trillion from their Republican tax cuts on stock buybacks for shareholders instead investing in their workers like they promised. This president’s policies continue to fail hard-working middle class Americans.
The president and our Republican colleagues continually attacked Americans' health care last year by:- Promoting junk insurance plans- Removing pre-existing conditions protections- And raising the costs of health premiums
If the president truly cared about the American people, he wouldn't keep trying to take away their access to affordable health care.
This president has failed the middle class. Period.
