Thank you to Lucas County Juvenile Court Judge Denise Navarre Cubbon for coming by to discuss the justice system and improving safety for women and children.
At a @HouseCommerce #subEnergy hearing today, I highlighted the need to provide statutory certainty when it comes to energy efficiency. More certainty for manufacturers means greater innovation and competition - a benefit for consumers.
I commend President Trump’s actions to address veteran suicide. I’ve supported legislation to turn this disturbing trend around, like the Clay Hunt SAV Act, but more must be done. Thank you to @POTUS for his efforts on this critical issue.

We’re all extremely grateful that Don Yi, a veteran and small business owner, is back on US soil. My office has been in touch with Mr. Yi during this process and was engaged with the appropriate federal agencies and officials while he was in South Korea.

Always great to see #Napoleon Mayor Jason Maassel and Councilmember Lori Siclair. Thanks to both for coming by my Washington office today to talk about the issues important to the Napoleon community.
I thank the three Senators for bucking their party on this important issue – but it’s disgraceful that they weren’t joined by more of their colleagues.As a member of the #ProLifeCaucus, we will continue to call up this legislation in the House until we are given a vote.
A dark day in the U.S. Senate with the defeat of the #BornAliveAbortionSurvivorsProtectionAct. It’s morally right to pass this bill. It’s backed by science. It’s supported by nearly 4 out of every 5 Americans - but 44 Dems still voted against it.
Great to be at the Regional Growth Partnership Annual Meeting this morning for an important conversation on economic development in the region.
New study out on the cost of the Green New Deal that says it will cost as  much as $93 TRILLION dollars over the next ten years. That is more than  $600,000 per American family. That’s……..a lot of money. This is not a serious
Congratulations to #WeAreOutdoors for all they do to benefit outdoor activities in our region.

I’ve introduced a bill that would do just that and believe it can gather bipartisan support. In fact, it is essentially the same legislation that former Democratic Chairman Henry Waxman authored in 2010.
When Congress passed Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, people were using phones like this one; technology has a changed a bit since then.After yrs of debate, it's time to pass legislation to ensure #NetNeutrality principles w/o using the burdensome #TitleII framework

The booming economy across the nation is showing up right here in Ohio  as the number of jobs hits an all-time high. Major gains in manufacturing are a big deal in Ohio's 5th Congressional District - home  to 60,000 plus manufacturing jobs.
Thank you to Jack for talking with me today about his personal experience with juvenile diabetes. I also appreciate David Green from JDRF-NW Ohio for his advocacy on issues related to diabetes research.
Spoke about the economy today at the #NapoleonRotary lunch. Unemployment is at a 49-year low for all workers and a 65-year low for women! Thank you to the rotarians for inviting me to speak.
Once again, thank you to the administrators, staff, and students at #fourcountycareercenter for showing me around today.
Another stop to talk about #CTE programs as I toured @FourCountyNews this morning.From the veterinarian assistant program, robotics, engineering, computer design, health science, + more - it’s amazing what these students are doing to prepare themselves for the jobs of tomorrow.
Great to join @scottsands on #WSPD this afternoon and talk about what’s going on in Washington and opioid legislation now on the way to the President’s desk.
It also highlights the importance of Career and Technical Education, which is why I've toured 4 career centers in #OH over the last week. Legislation signed by @POTUS to modernize Federal #CTE programs will help ensure that Americans are prepared to compete for the jobs of tmrw.
The booming economy has led to 7 million job openings. @MarketWatch: "In many cases (businesses) would have to offer better pay and benefits to attract new workers or to retain experienced ones. That’s led to rising incomes."
After the tour of Vantage, I spoke at the #VanWertRotary and covered a number of topics including opioids, CTE programs, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, precision agriculture, and legislation I’ve authored to lower costs and increase innovation for over-the-counter products.
Some more pictures from today’s tour of @vccstudents in Van Wert where I was able to tour the early childhood education, culinary arts, ag and industrial power technology, and CDL programs.
Went to tour @vccstudents in Van Wert today and next thing I know, I’m backing up an 18-wheeler!Great to tour Vantage, which is helping prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow.NOTE: No traffic cones were harmed in be making of this video.#keepontrucking
Congratulations to #FourCountyCareerCenter on 50 years of educating students and preparing them for the workforce! I presented a �� tonight in celebration of this milestone.
I held an informational event today at @DiscoverLourdes for first responders in our region on the appropriate procedures when encountering dangerous narcotics like fentanyl.
Congrats to Tim Bosserman who graduated from OCS and was commissioned as an Ensign in the @USNavy. Tim used to work in my BG office and while we miss him, we’re thankful for his service.Tim will soon start Naval Flight Officer Training and we wish him the best of luck!
Come out and enjoy the 42nd #GrandRapidsApplebutterFestival. You might want to help out and stir.
Over in #Hamler to have breakfast to support the volunteer fire department this morning. Our VFD’s do an incredible job protecting the citizens of NW Ohio and across the nation. �‍�
Incredible news that US Pastor Andrew Brunson has been freed and will soon be on his way home! I appreciate @POTUS for his continued commitment to religious freedom and all of his efforts to bring Pastor Brunson
