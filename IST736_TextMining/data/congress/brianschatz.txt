@jmartNYT is one of the very best. But I think this point is valid and I said at least a version of this when he interviewed me.
@ArthurSchwartz First of all, the state of Hawaii is an island chain. There is an island called Hawaii, but that’s not what you meant. Second, there is nothing in the GND resolution that calls for the abolition of air travel in ten years. Feel feee to get the last word I gotta make breakfast.
The word for today is “emoluments.”
@ArthurSchwartz So, the GND calls for “net zero emissions” which means that we will burn fossil fuels in sectors like aviation, then remove carbon in other ways, like reforestation, hence the word “net.” I know this was meant to “nail” me but I’m just answering the question on the level.
So the Sunday shows are gonna talk about the non binding resolution and not that the President is raiding military funds for the wall right? Ok I’m gonna watch basketball and maybe exercise.

If you think the big political news this week was a non binding resolution and not that the Trump administration is raiding money from the military for the wall you are spending too much time on the twitter machine.
@jpbrammer Yeah I think the problem gets to be people end up arguing about definitions as opposed to the positive impacts of our policies. Perhaps my tweet just made that worse, I don’t know.
@jpbrammer For one thing I don’t think it’s an accurate description of what our major candidates want to do or how they see things. I guess the other is that it seems unhelpful to allow an inaccurate and, for many voters, unpopular label to be slapped on otherwise popular policies.
I understand the instinct of some folks to reject the current system and identify as “social democrats” or as “socialists.” But no candidate is actually talking about “seizing the means of production.” Most are just trying to make things more fair, whatever you want to call it.
It is not socialist to think that college and healthcare should be affordable and that we should take action on climate. It is not communist to try to get high frequency traders or big pharma or big tech under control. It is, in fact, a logical response to what’s happening.
If a Democratic President raided money from service members and military construction projects no one would be talking about anything else for like three months.
R’s this week mocked climate action, voted against condemning bigotry, confirmed a bunch of wingnut judges including the guy who led lawsuit to gut protections for pre-existing conditions, backed raiding military $$ for wall. Vote for Democrats please and thank you.

Call your Senator and tell them not to raid pay, pensions, and military construction projects for the Wall. Tell them to vote YES to reject the fake emergency next week. 
DOD goes through a painstaking process to determine MilCon priorities. I will not support any cuts to these projects, and the idea of raiding these funds for the wall then asking us to make the same appropriation twice - what they are calling “backfilling,” is a nonstarter.

Voting to condemn antisemitism is fine, even if you feel compelled to do it twice. But I worry that accusation is a way to kill all debate about policy regarding Israel. And folks need some new, non inflammatory language to be supportive of Israel but opposed to Bibi’s policies.
It’s gonna be a lot of lying this week.
If this is true, it is an abuse.
Financial regulators in the United States are, by and large, too casual and imprecise about climate, and require too little disclosure of climate risks.
Hey we need to send Doug Jones some money. He’s good people and he’s up for re-election in Alabama next year. He can win, but not without you.

@drvox DM open!
I think we may be slightly underestimating the Republican vote count.
@ryangrim @RL_Miller I don’t see cosponsoring or not as essential to the strategy, and so therefore the concern you described, while plausible, doesn’t worry me a ton.
@ryangrim @RL_Miller I just think it’s early and we need to go through a process before anything gets declared to be the official GND. I like legislating!
@RL_Miller No. It’s important for folks to know that the GND has not been developed yet. It is a way to look at climate action, and the legislative program won’t be enacted until 2021. I intend to be very involved in that.
The Green New Deal is about putting people at the center of climate solutions. It’s about making sure that whatever we do to solve climate lifts people up economically. Investing in clean water, clean tech, helping farmers. Simple idea  - solve climate, but don’t ignore people.
Being ambitious on climate isn’t to make an ideological point. It’s because climate change is  impacting the weather, farming, coastal areas, fisheries and drinking water. Everyone from the NSA to the DOD to the Bank of England is saying it’s urgent. Big problem means big plans.

Underrated issues for 2020 - cost of insulin. Lead in housing. A financial transactions tax. Medicaid. The Paris Accords. Social Security. Puerto Rico statehood. Extending solar credits. Rural broadband. Preventing the VA from being privatized.
The point of the Green New Deal is 1) ambition on the scale of the problem. 2) making sure that what we do puts people first and isn’t so technocratic and wonky that it either hurts people or cannot pass.  Solve climate, help people.

These young people are super determined to solve climate change, and their moral and scientific clarity is impressive. This is a very good and necessary thing.
Reporters spent weeks chasing D’s around like climate action was somehow a political vulnerability for us. Now I would like them to ask R’s  1) What is your plan? 2) Do you think it’s right to have a person who compares climate action to nazism in charge of a climate commission?
This is like a Howard Schultz ratio except it’s good.
Most underrated climate solutions. Go!
There are some encouraging scientific developments in farming that, if scalable, could allow both small and large farms to serve as a significant carbon sink while increasing profitability.
This “net zero carbon” concept is worth understanding for a moment. It’s a new term for a lot of us. It means rather than immediately eliminate a source of carbon, you just make up for it somewhere else. Meaning we still have air travel cheeseburgers but plant more trees.
Our oceans are dying and we need to lead a global effort to save them. That starts with leading on plastics, fisheries, climate, coral.
Battery storage is getting better and better, which means super small scale generation, which will mean clean electricity in developing nations.
Solar and wind are getting cheaper so fast that they are already cheaper than fossil energy in lots of parts of the country.
Rejoining Paris is not just symbolic, it gives us a seat at the global table as energy decisions are being made.  It will also help us to recover the moral leadership lost during this time.
