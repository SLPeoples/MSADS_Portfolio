Dr. Wilson, thank you for your strong leadership and service with the @usairforce. #USAF ��
We should celebrate American values of freedom, free markets, and self-determination that have empowered women to shine and find opportunities to pursue our dreams.
The reality that socialist and communist regimes destroy the human rights of women and girls cannot be ignored on #InternationalWomensDay.
Mary Jane Kelliher, a 53 yr old single mom from Boston, says she now earns more than she did in all her previous jobs. “I feel like I’ve found my dream job,” she says. “I’m trying to learn as much as I can.” #IWD
Inspired by women entrepreneurs who are leading running their own businesses. Thank you, @SBALinda for sharing their stories.

Did you know? → “Racial minorities, those with less education and people working in the lowest-paying jobs are getting bigger pay raises and, in many cases, experiencing the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for their groups.”
This is exactly what it means to be an ability advocate.
Today in @HouseCommerce’s hearing on #DiversityInTech, I shared how ULTRA Testing is empowering people with #autism. ️ How a US start-up built a talent pool of people with autism– and found itself outperforming IBM
RT @HouseCommerce: GOP Leaders @repgregwalden, @boblatta, and @cathymcmorris on Democrats' #NetNeutrality legislation &gt;&gt;
Today, @HouseCommerce will discuss why we must make sure they are finding opportunities in #tech too. Watch our hearing, “Inclusion in Tech: How Diversity Benefits All Americans,” HERE→
After a decade of Americans asking, “where are the jobs,” we have the best job market in half a century. More people, including women, African Americans, Hispanics, and people with disabilities are coming off the sidelines finding work.
People rightfully expect that companies take steps to protect personal information, like social security numbers. Congress needs to look for a bipartisan solution that incentivizes the best tools and practices in data security.
Being an ability advocate means celebrating every step every success. WATCH more from my discussion about human dignity with @RealBenCarson @PYNance. #CPAC2019
People across the country are looking at this vote in the Senate, where Senators rejected the born-alive legislation, and they’re saying, “That’s not right.”
44 Democratic Senators voted against the Born-Alive Bill. This is extreme. Just as the science is undeniable, it should be unthinkable to deny life-saving care to a newborn baby.
Last year in #taxreform, I led on legislation called #ABLE to Work that will now allow people with disabilities to go explore work. Because a job means so much more than just a paycheck. It’s a foundation for a better life.
My prayers for safety are with the rescuers and first responders in southeast Alabama. May God  comfort and provide healing to these communities.
One year ago this weekend, I walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It was a reminder that every day is a new opportunity to bring people together on this journey to a more perfect union. #FPICivilRights
I’ve been #prolife my entire life. I’ve always known it in my head. After becoming a mom to Cole, Grace, and Brynn, I also know it in my heart. It’s why I’m passionate about celebrating the dignity and value of every person.
Heavy-handed regulations for #dataprivacy will hold back innovation that saves us time, makes our roads safer, and improves customer experiences.
Cole reminds me every day of the value potential of every human life. He’s inspired my work on Capitol Hill. I’m excited that bc of my bill in #taxreform, people with disabilities have more opportunities to explore work in America’s booming economy. #CPAC2019
One national standard for #dataprivacy will provide certainty to consumers, innovators, and entrepreneurs. Here’s why via my op-ed in @SeaTimesOpinion.
More from my podcast with @DailySignal from #CPAC2019→ Thanks to President Trump, tax reform regulatory reform, our economy is booming. It means more opportunities for every person to achieve their version of the American Dream.

Being #prolife also means empowering our children to reach their full potential through every stage of life. That’s why I led to make sure #taxreform was written for people with disabilities in mind by expanding #ABLE accounts.
️️️️️️
Just as the science is undeniable, it should be unthinkable to deny life-saving care to a newborn baby. I urge my colleagues across the aisle to take a step back, look at the science, and stop blocking the Born-Alive bill from becoming law. #prolife #CPAC2019
Because of Republican pro-growth policies→ There’s “a wave of disabled Americans joining or returning to the U.S. labor force, breaking a long-running trend that had pushed millions to the sidelines of work.”
So I’m proud that in our booming economy, a record number of people with disabilities are coming off the sidelines and joining the job market. In #taxreform, I led to expand #ABLE Accounts that empower people with disabilities to explore work.
I’ve only become a stronger advocate for the value and the potential of every life because I’ve seen the influence of Cole on our family and our circle of friends.
Our nation was founded on the belief in every person's inalienable human rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We should be celebrating what every life has to offer.
TODAY at 2:30 PM ET→ I’ll return to the @CPAC stage with @RealBenCarson @PYNance for a discussion on empowering every person to reach their full potential. Excited to join these fellow warriors for human dignity and human value! #CPAC2019

There are key principles that both sides agree on for #NetNeutrality. It’s time to come together on a forward-thinking bipartisan solution for an #openinternet.
Our nation was founded on the inalienable human rights for life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. That’s the promise of America, and why we’ll always be free. ��

Get the facts→ Tax rates were cut across the board in the #TaxCutsandJobsAct. A tax refund’s size has nothing to with whether or not one’s tax liability went up or down.
Did you know? → In addition to hydropower, Eastern Washington is leading on using renewable resources like wood.
A free #openinternet has improved the quality of life for millions of Americans. It should serve consumers in 2019 beyond, and not be regulated like a 1930s utility. Here’s where there is real bipartisan agreement on #NetNeutrality.
Get the facts on tax refunds this year→
A must read in @WSJopinion→ Rep. Jaime @HerreraBeutler share’s her remarkable #prolife story. Agree! We should be “empowering mothers to dwell in the realm of the possible.”
Happy Presidents’ Day! ��
How would Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders use this precedent for a national disaster declaration to force the Green New Deal on the American people?
It’s on us--all of us-- to keep fostering courageous conversations to restore trust and bring healing to our communities.
As I told @sandyhook last year, our work to stop, recognize, and respond to violence must not end there. For instance, we need to ensure the STOP School Violence Act is effectively helping schools utilize technology and resources that assess threats and keep children safe.
School should be a place of learning, where our children make friends, discover their passions, and reach their full potential. That’s why we took action in the last Congress on reforms to close loopholes in our background check system make our schools safer places to learn.
Together, one year after Parkland, we need to keep asking the difficult questions: “Why?” “What’s causing people to feel lost and alone?” “What’s leading them to choose violence?”
We must all be doing our part to protect the dignity of every person. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should come to the floor for a vote. It’s the right thing to do. #prolife
RT @SBAList: "I am frightened by anyone who would oppose the Born Alive Protection Act" - @cathymcmorris is speaking truth! ��

Happy 40th Anniversary, @NDSS �. You do amazing work to show the world what every person with Down syndrome has to offer.
Thank you to @realDonaldTrump for recognizing the need for American leadership in artificial intelligence.
In order for us to be a diplomatic power, we have to be a military power, and in order to be a military power, we have to be an economic power. Technology has revolutionized everything we do, and continued innovation is critical to the future of our 21st Century economy.
We can’t allow Congresswoman Ilhan Omar’s anti-Semitic attacks to divide us. She did the right thing by apologizing to the Jewish community.
Congressman Walter Jones served the people of North Carolina with integrity and humility. His kindness will surely be missed in the People’s House. May he rest in peace and may God bless his family.
We can be on the side of consumer protection AND innovation on a free #openinternet. Here’s how
Good news→ "Leisure and hospitality, health care, construction, and transportation and warehousing all saw strong gains. The economy added 660,000 blue-collar jobs in the past year, the best annual gain for such jobs since the financial crisis.”

People with disabilities are finding jobs at record levels. It’s because we’ve worked to unleash economic growth. With more jobs now available than people looking for work, more people are coming off the sidelines finding opportunities for a better life.
