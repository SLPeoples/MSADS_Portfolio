The House voted yet again to #endtheshutdown and fund all federal agencies—from @TSA to @USDA—but it’s up to @senatemajldr to act. In the meantime, @RepGolden I are cosponsoring H.R. 367 to ensure members of @USCG are not used as political pawns during a #shutdown. #mepolitics
Help spread the word to farmers: USDA Farm Service Agency offices in Maine will reopen temporarily to offer assistance on loans and tax filing. While we need to #endtheshutdown reopen these offices for good, I encourage farmers to get this help while they can #mepolitics
According to House Rules staff, the #116thCongress just made history. Today was the first time ever that a woman was in the chair while a woman was acting as parliamentarian, a woman was clerk on the rostrum, and two women were on the floor managing the rule. ��
Heading into the House Chamber where I’ll chair this morning’s debate to #endtheshutdown. #mepolitics
But as eager as I am to start on MIlCon-VA, my work on Agriculture Interior Approps has never been more important. Looking forward to pushing back on the anti-environment @EPA seeing how the @US_FDA can help lower the price of prescription drugs. #mepolitics (3/3)
This seat will allow me to secure funding that is vital to veterans' care and success, provide oversight of the @DeptVetAffairs, and go to bat for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and the thousands of Mainers who work there #mepolitics (2/3)
I'm excited to join the House @AppropsDems Subcommittee on Military Construction Veteran Affairs, putting me in a great position to advocate for programs and issues that are critical to Maine and the nation #mepolitics (1/3)
Too many Americans work full time while still living in poverty. I am proud to cosponsor the #RaisetheWage Act to bring the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024. It’s time to give Americans a long overdue raise—they’ve earned it
Federal workers should not have to rely on goodwill to feed themselves their families. The House is voting (yet again) this week to put them back to work so they can get their paychecks back. But it's up to Senate President to do their jobs #mepolitics
After feeding hurricane victims in Puerto Rico Texas, @chefjoseandres now helping federal workers impacted by the #trumpshutdown. I appreciate the generous aid he others are offering to them, but it's a travesty that it's needed... #mepolitics
Change can’t wait! � #greennewdeal
100 years ago women won the right to vote. Today 131 women are serving in the #116thCongress. To mark this historic moment, the @nytimes took all of our portraits. I’m incredibly proud to be among this group.
American farmers don’t need Trump’s wall—they’re already fenced in by his trade war gov't shutdown. Whatever he tells @farmbureau, farmers don't need to struggle w/o @USDA resources expertise--the House already voted twice to put agency back to
Today is day 24 of the #TrumpShutdown. I just spoke with @newscentermaine about the need to #endtheshutdown now before it takes an even greater toll on Mainers. #mepolitics
@drvox I love to cook and hated giving up gas stove.  Switched to solar panels supplying power for induction stove— can’t beat it.
Farmers don’t know what it means to shutdown. Every day they tend to their crops and animals we depend on their service. Today is #NationalMilkDay and a difficult time for the nation’s farmers so be sure to thank your local dairy farmer by purchasing #Maine milk products!
Today marks the first day that many federal government employees across the country won't be getting their regular paycheck, including over 1,100 vital federal workers in #Maine. None of them can afford another day of the #TrumpShutdown.
Oceans are the best thermometer we have for changes in the earth. The stakes are too high in the Gulf of #Maine to ignore climate change asthe Trump Administration has done. With or without the White House, wewill #ActOnClimate.
As this #TrumpShutdown now stretches into its 21st day, it’s critical that the 800,000 affected federal workers know that they will not lose their pay for a crisis they had no part in. #mepolitics
#BREAKING: I've reintroduced the bipartisan Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act because it's wrong to deny Americans access to lower cost Rx drugs in order to keep pharmaceutical companies happy. Consumers need relief now! #mepolitics
.@US_FDA is not doing routine food inspections during the #TrumpShutdown, which puts our health safety at risk. The FY 2019 Agriculture Appropriations bill ensures funding for @USDA FDA programs which touch the lives of every American. It’s time to #endtheshutdown.
RT @AppropsDems: .@chelliepingree: The #TrumpShutdown is having real impacts on Maine families and farmers. The @USDA cannot implement the…
