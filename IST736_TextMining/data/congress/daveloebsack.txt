Congrats to the Oskaloosa boys basketball team for winning the 3A state title! @OskyActivities @IHSAA #ia02
On his way out, EPA Admin Pruitt completely disregarded the law gave handouts to large oil cos who make MILLIONS in profits each year. The waivers were meant to support small, economically challenged refiners, not Exxon! It's a direct attack on the RFS and our farmers!
Leaders. Trailblazers. Artists. Politicians. Caretakers. Today and every day, we honor the women who have changed our lives. #IWD2019

Very glad to hear Fred is doing alright. My thoughts are with him, and  Terry and I send our wishes for a speedy recovery.
Questioned @TMobile and @sprint CEOs on effect of possible merger of the companies at @EnergyCommerce hearing. Concerned the merger could lead to fewer jobs in Iowa and worse wireless service across the state, which can already be dismal, or nonexistent

Additionally, Farm Service Agency offices were closed because of the shutdown, cutting off access to assistance with loans and tax prep. Glad to hear some offices are reopening, but Congress needs to end the shutdown and reopen these offices for good.
Iowa’s farmers and consumers were promised action on expanding E15 sales year-round. Because of the shutdown, the EPA’s rulemaking process is at risk of being delayed, affecting farmers and possibly raising prices at the pump! #EndTheShutdown
Loebsack: For the Good of Iowa, Steve King Needs to Resign
I have repeatedly called out Steve King as an embarrassment to the state of Iowa. To this day, he has done nothing to redeem himself. Finally, Republicans are beginning to stand up to his ugly and hateful rhetoric and beliefs.

#Equalpay is not just a women’s issue, but a financial issue as well. It impacts our families, businesses, economy. It's unacceptable that in Iowa, women are still earning 77 cents for every $1 paid to male counterparts. #EqualPayDay
Unfortunately, the @EPA joined Big Oil at the expense of Iowans' clean air pocketbooks. When fully in place, Clean Car Standards saves consumers $50 bil creates 650,000 jobs. Rolling them back is another example of the Admin siding with special interests over Iowa's interests
