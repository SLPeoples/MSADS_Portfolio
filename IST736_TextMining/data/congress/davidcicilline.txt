People. Vaccinate your kids.
I do too.
But by all means, let’s hear more about Democrats being in disarray.
This.
This is a fight worth having. Our planet depends on it.
Paul Manafort got off light.
This is incredible. Another Trump insider who didn’t tell the full truth to Congress. Needs to come back and correct the record. Sooner rather than later.
How many private jets did Jesus keep for himself, @JerryFalwellJr?

@SRoddy1171 That claim is laughable.  Non-citizens are already prohibited by federal law from voting. HR1 restores power in our democracy back to the people in this country away from the powerful corporate special interests.  Biggest ethics reform since Watergate! So proud we passed it!
Stopped by steak fry to support @StandDownRI that does so much for our great veterans!
Great day for a parade! Lots of green at St.Patricks’s Day Parade in Providence this afternoon.
Congrats to Portuguese Social Club in Pawtucket on renaming of street in honor of their more than 100 years of service to the community.
“Shoot. Democrats are cracking down on corruption. They’re bringing secret corporate spending out of the shadows. We better lie and say they support voter fraud. Hope it sticks because we don’t have any ideas of our own.” - Last @DanCrenshawTX strategy meeting, probably.

This might seem like a step in the right direction. But as I have said, Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself. I’ve had enough of their hollow promises and apology campaigns. Restoring Americans’ privacy must be a top priority for Congress.
Ok. So what was it then? And don’t say “very legal, very cool”

Democrats call out anti-Semitism and bigotry regardless of where it comes from. It would be nice if Republicans did the same to the President and members of their own party.

I’ve said it before. I’ll say it again. Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself. Congress needs to act.
Democrats are taking oversight seriously. Many of my Republican colleagues agree this is important, but they’re afraid of what will happen if the President attacks them in a Tweet. This is a time where we must do what is right, regardless of the political consequences.
Sad to hear Luke Perry passed away. 90210 is a classic. Covered topics important to young people that other shows didn’t touch. And no character was more interesting than Dylan. Rest In Peace.

It takes a lot of audacity for someone who said, “Iraq has weapons of mass destruction” to attack anyone else’s principles. The adults are in charge now, and we’re going to make sure we have all the facts before making a decision on how to proceed.
@Deb4CongressNM Thank you, Congresswoman!
Well, unlike the Bush White House, we are going to get the facts before we decide to act.
Sean Hannity is now volunteering himself as a witness. I look forward to his testimony.
RT @JesseFFerguson: This, um, didn't age well.
Donald Trump gave his son-in-law a security clearance at the same time he was taking them away from career public servants. Rest assured, that is something Congress will investigate.

Really disturbing that the President is taking Kim Jong Un’s word about the death of Otto Warmbier. Anyone who kills an American needs to be held accountable and not just talk their way out of it.
I agree with Attorney General Holder. No one is above the law. The President can be indicted.
If the President is using Members of Congress to Tweet threats against his perceived enemies, that’s something that Congress and DOJ should look into.
Proud that the House just passed legislation I co-sponsored to close the Charleston loophole. No one should be able to get a gun until the background check system has verified they are lawfully allowed to buy a gun.

�@David_Bossie knows something about lying. In the 1990s, he published doctored evidence during an investigation. It was so bad that even the House Republicans he worked for demanded he resign.
Congress needs to investigate these serious allegations further and decide on an appropriate action to take to protect the rule of law.
He laid out in a detail a series of facts that clearly suggest the President has engaged in both criminal activity and a concerted effort to deceive the American people about his conduct.

@Jenfitzlaw @StormyDaniels Not my committee, but thanks!
This is already the most damning testimony against a sitting President since @JohnWDean exposed Richard Nixon’s corruption.
The President, WHILE IN OFFICE, wrote a hush money check to cover up his affair with @StormyDaniels. That is a big deal.
