I will keep fighting for commonsense solutions to keep our communities safe and prevent tragedies caused by gun violence while strengthening mental health services in this country.
The majority of people with mental illness do not engage in violence against others, and most violence is caused by factors other than mental illness. It is important to remember these individuals are far more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators.
We must keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have access to them, such as domestic abusers and those with violent histories, and it is critical we do this without stigmatizing those with mental illness.
This bipartisan bill would require background checks for all gun purchases, with some reasonable exceptions, and is one of many long overdue steps forward to begin to address this epidemic, which claims over 36,000 lives every year on average.
Joined my colleagues in wearing orange and standing in solidarity with millions of Americans impacted by gun violence after we passed H.R. 8, ending 8 years of silence and inaction by the NRA-backed Republican-led House. #EndGunViolence

Grateful to be in La Puente, West Covina, Azusa, and Baldwin Park this Veterans Day, to honor the brave men and women who proudly served our nation in uniform and their families.

We are grateful to the city of El Monte for hosting the 4th Annual Congressional Prayer breakfast, which was dedicated in honor of Ventura County Sheriff’s Sgt. Ron Helus, who was tragically killed in the line of duty Wednesday night in Thousand Oaks.
Yesterday we honored police, fire, and military personnel from 13 San Gabriel Valley cities. These individuals are heroes among us, whose bravery and commitment to protecting our communities and nation know no equal.
These tragedies will remain a scourge in our nation until we pass meaningful solutions to prevent them. We must turn our grief into action and finally work together to stop gun violence.
Wounds inflicted by gun violence are not just physical but psychological. Counseling mental health services must be made available to all survivors, first responders, and all in need. If you or someone you know needs help, call SAMHSA Disaster Distress Helpline: 1-800-985-5990
We pray for the recovery of those injured and send our deepest sympathies to all of the families, colleges, and communities impacted. Thank you to all of the first responders for their brave actions in the face of peril.
