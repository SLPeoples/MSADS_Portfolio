@cpat3188 @nancyann1968 @RepMarkMeadows @realDonaldTrump No he didn’t. I was in the room. It was a closed room. That is not what Cohen said.

@gomets2017 That may be true. But pretty much on one thinks that the voting age is a simple or a moral question. In fact, it was ambiguous enough that it was the subject of an amendment to our constitution.

@JohnMetzger4 I did. Please see my statement. Anti-semitism has no place in the House or in our country.
@scott_sylvia Yes!! And your house plants. Though I fear most of them would join the Green Party.
@ManciniCT No question.
@orchidvariety Right?!?
@CTBiomed Hmm. Didn’t know I had a position on completing the Merritt Parkway. And I think such is unlikely to come up for a vote in the House. But would definitely be interested in learning more.
@gomets2017 Perhaps that’s true. Partly why I voted “present” rather than “against”
@CrankyEsq Yeah. Pretty sure Apple would like me to upgrade.
@bbbusta Hell. Sometimes I think 45 may be too young.
Learned 30 minutes ago about an amendment to lower the voting age to 16. Seems like a big deal. Zero facts. Zero research. Zero consultation w/constituents. So did something I’ve never done before and voted “present”. I hope that was respectful of your collective opinions.

I hate this deflection. Of course POTUS has the right to over-ride CIA/FBI concerns on security clearances. He also has the right to launch a nuclear attack. He has the right to pardon vicious criminals. A right does not mean it’s a wise idea.

@kenkrayeske @GOP Wow. That’s quite the leap. You said you can’t compromise with the gop. I pointed out a few examples where it happened. Important, because they have the senate and presidency. If you were right, all progress would be impossible.

@gelliottmorris Also fair.

@SherryWernicke “Or”??
@gelliottmorris And to be clear for the anti-fans: I’m not defending Mr Schultz, who appears to be running out of self regard without discernible political ideas. I am defending a better and more careful political dialog.
@gelliottmorris Ah, now we have the modifier “implies” rather than equivalence. But is it not possible that Mr. Schultz means what he says, that it is unamerican to say something “can’t succeed”? That’s kind of true. But instead he’s a fascist?
@pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Part of the reason we’ve been quiet is that the committee hasn’t technically existed for a month.
@pwnedlib @gelliottmorris So instead of sitting on a train having a beer perusing Twitter, I should be “doing investigative work”. Perhaps down the way in the Quiet Car?
@pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Fair enough. As far as I can tell, he has no discernible reason for running other than self-regard and frustration.
@pwnedlib @gelliottmorris Also a logical fallacy. The thing about defending the truth is that it’s most important to do when it is unpopular to do so. Comfort with convenient untruths is the fuel for con men and sophists.
@gelliottmorris Dude. I carry no H2O for Mr. Schultz. But you’re a journalist. For The Economist no less. UnAmerican is not the equivalent of fascist.
The President thinks the intelligence community is wrong. The Republicans voted in favor of government shutdowns today. And Chicago is deliberately lighting its train tracks on fire. Tonight I put neither olives nor vermouth in my martini.
@speaktoEnglish Precisely. Glad we agree.
With the Intelligence chiefs explaining down the hall that North Korea has not denuclearized and that ISIS is not defeated, looks like the Executive Branch is being a pretty effective check and balance on the Executive Branch.

I get frustrated at the distractions. But this is mind blowing. The President can’t give the #SOTU without a Resolution from Congress that Pelosi ain’t gonna do. Who advised him to play a game he couldn’t win?He has just highlighted that Nancy Pelosi can and will say no to him.
