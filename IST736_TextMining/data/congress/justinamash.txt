@rdlln Local elections should be managed locally, as the Founders believed and as our Constitution provides.

Congress should (and I will) work to repeal laws that ostensibly grant legislative powers to the president. But even if Congress does no such thing, such laws are void under our Constitution, and any emergency declaration by the president for a non-emergency is likewise void.
It would mean that a simple majority of each chamber could delegate legislative powers to the president, but only a two-thirds majority or greater could reject their application to a particular case or repeal the delegation altogether.
Some have replied that Congress still retains legislative powers should the president abuse an emergency declaration. They note that Congress can pass legislation to override the president’s actions. Though true, this arrangement turns the Constitution on its head.
Can Congress make a law permitting the president to conduct the entire appropriations process by his declaring an emergency? Of course not. That would impermissibly grant him legislative powers. The same principle applies when addressing a portion of the appropriations process.
Congress cannot turn the executive branch into the legislative branch. Such an effort fails for lack of conformity to our Constitution. The validity of an emergency declaration is limited by the definition of “emergency” itself and cannot be expanded by statutory openness.
Congress can make no law permitting the president to assume permanent legislative powers, even in a single area, simply by his declaring an emergency. The president may act quasi-legislatively only in an actual emergency—when Congress has no time to act—and then only temporarily.
Laws like the War Powers Resolution and the National Emergencies Act are not—and, under our Constitution, cannot be—grants of legislative powers to the president. They were adopted to transition authority back to Congress when unilateral executive action is no longer appropriate.
Over the years, Congress has passed laws to create an orderly process for receding the president’s inherent emergency power as an emergency subsides—the War Powers Resolution and the National Emergencies Act are two examples.
Going back to the Framers of the Constitution, Americans have recognized the president’s inherent power as chief executive to act swiftly in an emergency, especially a sudden attack on the United States. But such power exists only so long as Congress has no opportunity to act.
A thread on national emergencies and our Constitution:Congress makes laws.The president executes laws.The Supreme Court decides cases.This is our constitutional system.Congress cannot delegate legislative powers to the president by statute.
A national emergency declaration for a non-emergency is void. A prerequisite for declaring an emergency is that the situation requires immediate action and Congress does not have an opportunity to act. @POTUS @realDonaldTrump is attempting to circumvent our constitutional system.
@steve_vladeck You’re employing a straw man if you’re suggesting that Meadows considers himself a libertarian.

Today, I attended the funeral of my friend Walter Jones and said goodbye. Walter was a good man. I do not expect to meet another of his caliber in this life.
I can’t support legislation that endorses an expansion of the 2001 AUMF and continued intelligence sharing with the Saudis with respect to Yemen operations. Many of my colleagues share these concerns and hope it will be changed in the Senate. I’m skeptical, but I hope so, too.
Worse, the House made another change: It adopted an amendment to “clarify” that the United States may continue sharing intelligence with the Saudis, including on potential targets—directly undermining the legislation’s goal of ending U.S. involvement in the horrific Yemen war.
.@RepMcGovern co. saw the problem and drafted an amdt (w/@RoKhanna’s support) to remove the exception, but senators lobbied against it behind the scenes. McGovern ultimately withdrew the amdt, so the joint res endorses the executive branch’s broad application of the 2001 AUMF.
.@RoKhanna introduced text the Senate passed in 2018. It creates an exception for “Armed Forces engaged in operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces.” But Congress did not, via the 2001 AUMF, authorize force against nebulous “associated forces,” just 9/11 perpetrators.
I’ve introduced legislation to end U.S. military action in Yemen: I couldn’t support yesterday’s legislation because it implicitly expands the 2001 authorization regarding 9/11. @RoKhanna is doing great work here, but others keep sabotaging his efforts.

@RealFacelessMan @byrdinator @DemocraticLuntz The legislation makes an exception for “Armed Forces engaged in operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces.” The notion of undefined “associated forces” is not part of the 2001 AUMF and significantly expands it. The AUMF authorizes force against the 9/11 perpetrators.
@byrdinator @DemocraticLuntz Oh, I see you’re also asking about the underlying legislation. I couldn’t support it after McGovern withdrew his amendment. Without his amendment, the joint resolution implicitly endorses an expansion of the 2001 AUMF.

Finally, it’s unfortunate but not surprising that the president didn’t mention the massive national debt—overwhelmingly the result of reckless spending. He signed several of these disastrous bills into law. This spending is unsustainable and threatens the prosperity of Americans.
On foreign policy, the president was hit or miss (as usual), but he’s right that it’s time to bring our forces home from Syria and Afghanistan. One war was never authorized, and the other has gone on for far too long.
As for the president’s policies on trade and tariffs, I have a couple book recommendations for him:
I’m pleased the president highlighted the importance of criminal justice reform, including passage of the #FirstStepAct. We need to do much more to reform the system at both the federal and state levels of government.
The president rightly denounced the destructive politics of partisanship. Unfortunately, he’s been anything but nonpartisan (see tweets). Americans deserve principled representation and honest policy debates, not politicians who incite suspicion, fear, and hatred of “the others.”
There were two outstanding lines in @POTUS’s #SOTU address:“America was founded on liberty and independence—not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.”“Great nations do not fight endless wars.”

Democratic leaders would love for @POTUS to declare a national emergency. They love the idea, currently championed by many Republicans, that “emergency” has no meaning—that the president alone defines it. They can’t wait for him and other Republicans to ratify that view.
@JTNH1489 What do you mean? You just posted the same news. And “misguided” nicely describes all these big-government-loving politicians, like @ScottWalker and @SpeakerRyan, who support corporate welfare and central planning.
This corporate welfare project was just another big publicity stunt for politicians.

An “emergency” does not elicit endless debate without consensus, nor is it addressed with a plan requiring years to execute. A house is burning, a ship is sinking, a city is flooding—these are considered emergencies precisely because everyone agrees they require immediate action.

@KevinBuist @nickrmanes Almost nobody thinks that’s what he means anymore (if ever). I’m not here to defend the president’s wild and/or false assertions about the wall or immigration. I’m simply saying it’s not worth either side’s partially shutting down the government.
@KevinBuist @nickrmanes I mean, Kevin, it’s hard to say I have no credibility on limiting government spending: My point was that the wall funding is relatively small, and everyone knows the president really means enhanced fencing, which Democrats have previously supported.
The clearest sign of lessons not learned is that only a few people are negotiating whatever comes next. That’s not how our system is supposed to work. Open up Congress. Let us consider new ideas. Let us deliberate. Let us legislate. Until that happens, things will not get better.
These spending bills are massive and wasteful, but nobody talks about that. @POTUS and most of Congress made the fight all about the wall. After five weeks of shutdown, we’re left with the same irresponsible bills, no wall, and seemingly zero lessons learned. What was the point?

Some say a congressman shouldn’t object that a bill applies indefinitely b/c a future Congress can override it. My job is not to consider what a future Congress may (not) do; I object to a *current* statement of policy that “reject[s] any efforts” unconditionally into the future.
Yesterday, the House voted on an extreme, misguided measure regarding NATO. This bill doesn’t simply instruct @POTUS he can’t withdraw without congressional approval; rather, it includes a blanket rejection of *any* proposal *ever* to Congress to alter this alliance. I voted no.
