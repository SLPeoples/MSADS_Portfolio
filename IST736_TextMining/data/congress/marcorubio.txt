Today another transformer explosion at the German Dam in Bolivar State caused another massive blackout. The result? Critically ill patients have died, the #Caracas metro remains out of service few if any flights have arrived at or departed from Caracas in over 20 hours. 2/3
The worst electricity telecommunications blackout in #Venezuela history’s going on 48 hours.A blackout caused by #MaduroRegime negligence. A load rejection issue knocked out the Guri-Malena transmission line led to multiple transformer explosions.  1/3

How do you get a 36 hour nationwide power outage like what happened in #Venezuela? You buy the “loyalty” of corrupt military officials by giving them control over electricity company. Instead of investing in maintenance, they steal the money.

UPDATE: reports of new blackouts in the areas where electric service was restored in #Caracas. Proof that this life threatening nationwide power outage is the direct result of an electric grid in total collapse. They can’t sustain power even after it is restored.
The nationwide power failure in #Venezuela now going on its 25th hour is causing devastating long term economic damage.In the blink of an eye the countries entire aluminum production capacity was destroyed by damage caused by the blackout.

One byproduct of nationwide power outage in #Venezuela is that much of the country is currently offline with no access to cell phone service or internet coverage.

The #MaduroRegime deployed it’s most trustworthy security forces to the border last week to keep out humanitarian aid out of #Venezuela. But in the last week over 17% of them have abandoned the regime defected. No tyranny can survive for long with a 17% defection rate.

Estimated that #MaduroRegime deployed around 3500 uniformed members of national police military to the border crossings with Colombia. 567 defectors means over 16% of #Venezuela security forces deployed to the border have abandoned the regime over the last five days.
Over the last few hours another 156 Venezuelan soldiers have defected pledged support to the interim government of @jguaido. Over the last five days 567 members of the #Venezuelan military have abandoned the #MaduroRegime.
#MaduroRegime strategy based on 2 things:- hope the interim government of @jguaido will fracture because of personal ambitions personal differences of various leaders; international community will losing interest in #Venezuela stop the pressure. Not going to happen.
#Hezbollah support of #MaduroRegime is extensive. Meet Edwar Quiroga (aka Hussein Quiroga). He is Hezbollah point man in #Peru many parts of Latin America. He is also very close to the #MaduroCrimeFamily.

I would love to have a deal with #NorthKorea that eliminates their nuclear weapons missiles in exhange for lifting many sanctions. But agreeing to sanctions relief while allowing them to hide warheads keep missiles would not just be a bad deal,it would be a dangerous one.
