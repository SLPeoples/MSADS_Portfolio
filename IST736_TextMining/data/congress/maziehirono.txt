I’ll be joining @JakeSherman and @apalmerdc for a #politicoexchange keynote discussion at #SXSW2019 shortly. Tune in live.
Happy #InternationalWomensDay! Today we celebrate the progress we’ve made in breaking down barriers and glass ceilings like right here in Congress. While we’ve made great steps for equal representation, the fight continues.
Today, I joined @NTEUnews members to fight back against President Trump and Mitch McConnell’s unyielding campaign to pack the courts with anti-worker judges. I'm proud to stand with federal workers who dedicate themselves to serving and protecting our country every day.
I'm grateful for my colleagues @SenJeffMerkley and @SenCortezMasto in joining me today to unveil immigration bills to improve the care and treatment of immigrant children at the US southern border. We need to #BalancetheScales now. WATCH LIVE:
There's a clear lack of humanity in how Customs and Border Protection treats immigrants crossing the border. We must change the culture and train CBP to give asylum seekers, esp. children, the care they need and treat them as humans seeking a better life.
When Kevin McAleenan comes before the Judiciary Committee today, we'll question him on what happened at CBP when two children died in their custody and what steps are being made to ensure this doesn’t happen again.
Today is #AAPIEqualPay Day – the day when AAPI women’s pay catches up to what their white, male colleagues earned in 2018. It takes over two extra months to earn what they earn in just a year. It’s time we close that gap and pass the Paycheck Fairness Act now.

.@realDonaldTrump has called me crazy once again for supporting the #GreenNewDeal. His incoherent criticism is on par with other climate change deniers who also seem scared silly to face the facts of climate change.
Republicans hurt women. Now they're condemning women who  face the agonizing decision of needing a late term abortion. Compassion and understanding are called for in this situation - it is not the time for the heavy hand of government to reach into our wombs. #HowDareYou
The hard truth is that the Republican Party hurts women. They demonize them for their medical needs, cut off crucial health care, and they create loopholes to allow businesses to exclude coverage. To make sure these efforts stick, they pack the courts.
.@realDonaldTrump thinks that the same kind of flattery that works on him works on everyone else. Outcome at #HanoiSummit proves otherwise. Diplomacy through narcissism, rather than extensive preparation, doesn't work.
Let me be clear: infanticide is already illegal. This bill continues Republicans' ceaseless efforts to push a false narrative to achieve their goals of shaming women, criminalizing doctors, and ending a woman's right to a safe, legal abortion.
Andrew Wheeler is the perfect example of a cabinet appointment in the Trump era – conflicted, unethical, and hostile to the mission of the agency he was nominated to lead. He shouldn't have been confirmed as Deputy Admin, and he shouldn't be confirmed now.

Conservative politicians should not be telling doctors how they should care for their patients. Instead, women - in consultation with their families and doctors - are best positioned to determine their best course of care. 
Tofu poke was one of the most popular dishes at last year’s Hawaii on the Hill. Today, I visited the company whose tofu was such a hit – @AlohaTofu where I learned about the history of this third-generation, family owned company and got a taste of their varieties of tofu.
Hawaii continues to be at the forefront in the fight for a woman’s health and reproductive rights with the opening of the new Honolulu Center for @PPGNHI. We know that the battles we’ve won for our hard-earned rights don’t stay won. Constant vigilance is key.
I spent yesterday on Maui, where I had the honor of addressing the Healthy Communities Initiative – a project that fosters collaboration between the health and community development sectors to secure a healthier future for all residents of Maui.
Over the past two days, I visited with staff and volunteers at @hawaiifoodbank on Oahu and @MauiFoodBank to thank them for their critical, life-sustaining work throughout the government shutdown to help thousands of workers in our state who went a month without pay.

.@realDonaldTrump surrounds himself with grifters and takers. We can't trust Bill Barr to be an independent Attorney General.
Barr's record and positions on DOJ’s important responsibilities - enforcing civil rights laws, defending laws enacted by Congress, protecting established Constitutional rights - are unacceptable. He should not be the nation’s top law enforcement officer.
While we focus on a Free and Open Indo-Pacific, we must be prepared to defend against the threats in the region. Watch live as I question USINDOPACOM and US Forces Korea on our status as the first line of defense and the Homeland Defense Radar.
Justice Kavanaugh's first published opinion in an abortion case is true to form in siding with the anti-abortion forces. Stay tuned for more.

Just as with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, it took a lot of courage for Dr. Vanessa Tyson and Meredith Watson to come forward to be heard. Their courage is part of the change we need and the responsibility we all share to end the scourge of sexual violence in our country
With this second serious and credible allegation of sexual assault, Justin Fairfax should resign. This is not a partisan issue.
It was a privilege to serve with @JohnDingell for 6 of his 59 years in the House. He was a champion for so many important causes, from civil rights, to the environment and affordable health care. We will miss his tweets, humor, sharp wit, and dedication to public service.
I welcome the bold national framework of the #GreenNewDeal that tracks so closely to what Hawaii is already doing and what many of us have long advocated to enable communities, families, and individuals to thrive.
Confronting the challenge of climate change requires a comprehensive approach to transforming our country in a way that prioritizes environmental health and wellness, while also expanding opportunity and creating good-paying jobs as we transition to a low carbon economy.
From committing to 100 percent renewable energy, to embracing a carbon neutral economy, Hawaii has taken aggressive action to combat climate change because of the threat it poses to our way of life.
Poverty is not just a mindset. Birth control does not cause cancer. Transgender children are not delusions. These nominees in the #MonsterMarkup are not the kind of judges that will protect the rights of all Americans and promote the independence and integrity of our courts.

We can't wait for @realDonaldTrump to end the #TrumpShutdown because you can't talk sense to someone who makes no sense. Mitch McConnell could do his job today by bringing up the House-passed bills to reopen the government for a vote.
Let me be clear: the only crisis is the one Trump manufactured and the only wall that’s real is the one closing in on him. The detention of unaccompanied children for longer periods is the real crisis facing our country. Let's end the #TrumpShutdown now.
Mitch McConnell has said he has no power to bring these bills to the floor. I'd like to remind him that Congress is a separate branch of government. Senator McConnell can end the #TrumpShutdown right now.
It's bad enough that @realDonaldTrump is taking money from 800,000 federal workers tens of thousands of contractors for this manufactured crisis, but now he's trying to take money from disaster victims.
Proud to stand in solidarity with furloughed workers, union leaders, and activists rallying with @AFLCIO to demand Mitch McConnell end the #TrumpShutdown and get more than 800,000 federal workers back on the job.
The President is an amoral hostage taker – and you cannot and should not negotiate with a hostage taker.It’s time for Senator McConnell to stand up to Donald Trump and end the #TrumpShutdown.
Spoiler Alert: The President will lie to the American people from the Oval Office tonight. The only crisis that exists is the one he manufactured and the only wall that's real is the one closing in on him.

Donald Trump needs to face the reality that he won’t get $5 billion for his wall and accept responsibility for keeping the government running.
But at the 11th hour, Donald Trump succumbed to pressure from his far right-wing base and chose to shut down the government for a $5 billion down payment on his vanity wall. This shutdown is totally unfair, completely unnecessary, and entirely the President’s fault.
Two nights ago, the Senate did its job by passing a bill to keep the government open with the expectation that the House would pass it and that the President would sign it into law.
These last two days have felt like we've been on a roller coaster with @realDonaldTrump at the controls. The Senate did the responsible thing by keeping government running—only to have President Trump get all worked up by some right-wing loud people yelling at him on Fox News.

The Trump administration is stripping away the humanity of immigrant families. Immigrants are human beings who want to have a chance at a better life, and we should give them that chance.
I asked Patricia what she hoped life in the US would hold for her and her daughter. She just smiled, and that said everything. Remember Patricia and her smile. This administration will continue its cruel and inhumane treatment of these families, and we have to fight back.
At the end of our visit to Dilley, we were able to speak with Patricia, who has been here with her daughter for six months—much longer than DHS is legally allowed to detain minors. They crossed the border fleeing gang violence in Honduras.
Yesterday, we visited two family detention centers in Texas—Dilley and Karnes. DHS watched us closely throughout our tour, but what we were able to see was disturbing. They are herding families who are fleeing unspeakable violence into these internment camps.
Appeals are certain to follow. In the mean time, everyone can and should still visit to sign up for 2019 coverage before tomorrow's open enrollment deadline. The fight continues.
Through Texas lawsuit, Republicans took a giant step toward achieving their longstanding goal of eliminating health care for millions of Americans, especially those with preexisting conditions. Millions of Americans are counting on us.
Immigrant families, especially children, deserve compassion, not fear and suffering. I know because I came to this country when I was seven. That's why I'm in Texas this weekend to conduct oversight over the treatment of detained immigrant children families at the border.

This Veterans Day, we are reminded of the bravery and commitment of the men and women who have served and are still serving our country. As we recall their courage and strength, we must also ensure that their acts of valor are appropriately recognized.
Robert Mueller has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate 4 times for 3 DOJ positions. He doesn’t require Senate confirmation now, but @realDonaldTrump’s ignorant comments make passing bipartisan legislation to protect the Special Counsel’s investigation even more important.

Our next AG must not only commit to the completion of the Special Counsel’s investigation without interference, but also to preserve the independence of DOJ its law enforcement agencies, enforce our nation’s laws fairly, safeguard the civil and voting rights of all Americans.
The President’s actions today make it even more critical that Congress passes bipartisan legislation to protect the Special Counsel’s investigation.
In a direct move to undermine the Mueller investigation, @realDonaldTrump forced Jeff Sessions to resign. I am concerned that the Mueller investigation will now be overseen by Acting AG Matthew Whitaker – someone who has raised some troubling views about the investigation.

"Mr. Kavanaugh’s appointment could also jeopardize the Indian Child Welfare Act, Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, and other laws that enable tribal self-determination due to his overly narrow view of the relationship between federal and tribal governments." #StopKavanaugh
.@HoltonArms alumna Alexis Goldstein said it best. "Don't mess with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. Don't mess with the alumnae of the Holton-Arms School. But most importantly, don't mess with survivors."
Today, @SenGillibrand and I accepted a letter signed by over 1,000 alumnae of @HoltonArms in support of and in solidarity with Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. I will enter it into the Committee record to show that we are standing together because we #BelieveWomen.
RT @MaddowBlog: Senator Hirono on death threats and intimidation of Dr. Ford: "That sounds like witness tampering to me."
The entire array of the White House's power is behind Judge Kavanaugh. It not only places Dr. Blasey Ford at a disadvantage, it victimizes her. No survivor of sexual assault should be subjected to death threats and concern about the safety of their family.
We will not stand for the continued victimization and smearing of Dr. Blasey Ford. All of us must work to end this kind of treatment of survivors who bravely share their experiences.

The Hawaii Congressional Delegation urged @USDA to provide direct assistance to Hawaii farmers affected by recent natural disasters. Our producers desperately need the maximum assistance practicable to get back on their feet.
This development is yet another reason not to rush Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination. The Committee should postpone this week’s vote.
As I said during the hearing, this is why the #MeToo movement is so important, because often in these situations, there is an environment where people see nothing, hear nothing, and say nothing. That is what we have to change.
It took a lot of courage for Christine Blasey Ford to come forward to share her story of sexual assault by Brett Kavanaugh. Her story is very credible and I believe her.
From @oha_hawaii: Judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated a low level of knowledge about the history of Native Hawaiians their pre-existing sovereignty well before western contact. His nomination is alarming to all American Indians, Alaskan Natives Native Hawaiians. #StopKavanaugh
The American people deserve to know the full extent of Brett Kavanaugh's lies regarding indigenous communities. That's why I made a motion to subpoena any additional records relating to his work on Native Hawaiians, Native Americans, and Alaska Natives. #WhatAreTheyHiding
Mahalo to @NCAI1944 for your advocacy on behalf of native communities. We will continue to stand together against divide and conquer tactics targeting Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and Native Americans.
