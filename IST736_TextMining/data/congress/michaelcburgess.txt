Those who pay taxes should have a voice in our democracy. As a teen, I worked paid taxes. This week I voted for an amdt that would give young adults the right to vote - it failed by a wide margin. I support policies that encourage work this could be part of the conversation.
Bottom line: #HR1 is bad policy that @POTUS has promised to veto. I voted no on this overt power grab and I'll keep fighting for Americans' personal freedom.
The U.S. Constitution guarantees certain inalienable rights – including the freedom to practice the religion of one’s choice. As Members of Congress, we must hold ourselves to the highest standards stand together to protect the rights of our fellow Americans. My full statement:
I'm sorry to hear that my friend and fellow Texan Congressman Ralph Hall has passed away. It was a privilege to serve alongside him in the U.S. House and on @HouseCommerce. A WWII veteran, Ralph is another member of the Greatest Generation who will be sorely missed.
Promoting the safety and efficiency of vaccines is a bipartisan priority as we seek to protect Americans and people around the world from preventable suffering. Alongside @RepAdamSchiff, I introduced a resolution recognizing the importance of vaccines.
.@HouseGOP Members don’t want to create a campaign $$ ATM funded by hardworking American taxpayers, we don’t want Constitutional overreach, and we certainly don’t want #HR1 to become the law of the land.
The Democrat Politician Protection Act would create a 6 to 1 taxpayer-funded match of small dollar donations to congressional campaigns. This means American taxpayers would be on the hook to fund campaigns of politicians that they don't support.
States – not the federal government – should control the electoral process. This legislation is another step in @HouseDemocrats’ extreme agenda to reduce Americans’ personal freedom and protect their own swampy politicians.
Last night in @RulesReps, we considered #HR1 - @HouseDemocrats’ blatant power grab crafted to protect left-leaning politicians. This bill is Democrats' wish list of policies that constrain free speech, limit states' rights, and redirect power to Washington, DC.
Under Commissioner @SGottliebFDA’s leadership, @US_FDA has expanded innovation and produced tangible results for patients – offering hope and even cures to American families. I am grateful to Dr. Gottlieb for his service to the American people and wish him well.
I'm grateful to @SecAzar, @GovAbbott, and Administrator @SeemaCMS for their service to Texans.
I join my fellow Texans celebrating freedom on this #TexasIndependenceDay.
Thank you to @wfaa anchor @johnmccaa for 35 years of service to North Texas. After more than three decades on the airwaves, we will miss seeing this broadcast veteran on our television screens each night. #ThanksJohn
I introduced the TROL Act, H.R. 108, to protect legitimate patent holders and stop bad actors. This @Apple move underscores why we must protect Americans' intellectual property and stop limiting their potential to innovate.
This week @repgregwalden, @RepGuthrie, and I sent a letter to @CDCDirector Dr. Robert Redfield asking how @CDCgov is planning to improve #flu vaccine coverage for seniors.
Do you remember when Democrats promised that if you liked your doctor, you could keep your doctor? With their latest Soviet-style health care bill, at least they're being honest: -&gt; You can't keep your doctor. -&gt; You can't keep your insurance. -&gt; You get nothing.
.@SpeakerPelosi did “pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it” before – and it didn't work well. It's time for @EnergyCommerce, the committee of jurisdiction, to hold a hearing on Democrats' Soviet-style health care bill and its disastrous implications for Americans.
By blocking the #BornAliveAct, Senate Democrats showed us who they are – and it isn’t good. Their derailment of this bill is unconscionable. If a child arrives in the world alive, he or she is entitled to the same Constitutionally-protected rights that the rest of us have.
I stand alongside #prolife leaders @RepAnnWagner, Whip @SteveScalise, and @RepChrisSmith in support of the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This legislation is about protecting the basic human rights of children who are born alive.
The text of Democrats' socialist-style health care takeover bill confirms that they are indeed in favor of single-payer, government-run health care. This is no longer an extreme left-wing proposal, it's the new normal for @HouseDemocrats.
As a physician, I’m concerned about the recent uptick in measles cases in North Texas around the country. Today @HouseCommerce will hear from @NIH's Dr. Fauci and @CDCgov's Dr. Messonnier as we consider how best to help those impacted by this disease.
If @HouseDemocrats don’t like the law that allows @POTUS to declare an emergency, then they ought to change the law. Today’s vote is about politics – not solutions. Congress must allow President Trump to do his job, protect the American people, and defend our southern border.
.@SpeakerPelosi values regular order so much that she’s holding a vote on the resolution of disapproval today … and hearings on the legislation on Thursday. Our national security never should be used as political fodder.
The value of work is an important tenet of the American story. I joined @RepKevinHern to send a letter to @SecretarySonny supporting stronger work requirements for #SNAP benefits because it’s critical for Congress to encourage families to succeed.
ICYMI: While Democrats are busy using @HHSgov ORR shelters as political props, I’m working to ensure that unaccompanied minors who cross our border are safe.
Last week at @EnergyCommerce, @gracemarietweet presented an excellent case for greater health care freedom that gives Americans the right to choose coverage that works for them. Read more in @Forbes:
It was great to catch up with @GovAbbott this week in Austin as we collaborate on ways to serve Texans, including our work to extend our state's @CMSGov #1115Waiver to protect Texas patients' access to quality care.
It’s unfortunate that @HouseDemocrats continue to put their political agenda ahead of the truth. No one should be surprised that they are making headlines by mischaracterizing a shelter providing critical compassionate care to vulnerable kids.
Thanks to Lt. Gov. @DanPatrick for a productive meeting at the Texas Capitol this morning.
For real change, Congress must hold the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras accountable for the wellbeing of their children. There’s a Burgess bill for that ️
As Congress focuses on oversight, we must remember that lawmakers' rhetoric empty promises can be used by coyotes to entice families to attempt the dangerous journey to reach our border. This is just inhumane.
ICYMI: While Democrats are busy using @HHSGov ORR shelters as political props, I’m working to ensure that unaccompanied minors who cross our border are safe.
Though other Members of Congress on this trip regard these shelters as nothing more than political props, I remain committed to doing our job – oversight. While they malign @POTUS, I’ll keep working alongside @SecAzar and @HHSgov to ensure that all kids receive quality care.
During my visit to both the Homestead and Boystown ORR shelters today, I was pleased to see children receiving excellent care from dedicated @HHSGov staff.
I had a productive meeting with Assistant to the President and Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Ronny Jackson at the @WhiteHouse last week. I’m looking forward to working with this fellow Texan on our nation’s health care.
Alongside President @realDonaldTrump and @SecPompeo, I condemn this violent attack.
Thank you to students from @leisd Oak Point Elementary for making these valentines for our local North Texas veterans receiving care at the Denton @DeptVetAffairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic.
As @RulesReps considered the appropriations bill, I offered an amendment to hold the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras accountable for the well-being of their children. Though my amendment was not accepted, I believe this is the correct way to move forward.
The governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras have been unable, and sometimes unwilling, to combat the corruption, drug trafficking, and gang violence that drive irregular migration. Congress must continue to encourage the leaders of these nations to take responsibility.
Since 2014, American taxpayers have spent more than $3 billion caring for other countries' children once they reach our border – in addition to the foreign assistance the U.S. provides to their home countries. Simply, it is wrong to charge Americans twice for the same purpose.
The flu is a formidable foe, but together we can protect our North Texas neighbors. Washing our hands, avoiding contact with sick people, and getting a flu shot are simple ways to help those who are more vulnerable to the virus.
ICYMI: @repgregwalden and I have asked @EnergyCommerce leaders to hold a hearing on their radical plans to force Americans into single-payer health care, eliminate private insurance, cost taxpayers $32 trillion, and end Medicare as we know it.
This @EnergyCommerce hearing is another attempt to distract from Dems' agenda to establish government-run, single-payer health care. Although they refuse to discuss their radical plan with GOP Members, they're clearly happy to share it with the media.
Nearly every day, I hear from Texans about their sky-high premiums deductibles. What good is health insurance if you're afraid to use it because you can’t afford your deductible? Unfortunately today's @EnergyCommerce hearing is a missed opportunity to address this urgent issue.
Today I had the privilege of joining @NIH leaders for a discussion on the future of medical advancement. These remarkable men and women are tasked with propelling tomorrow’s innovation into results for the American people, and I’m grateful for their contributions.
I recently had an opportunity in @RulesReps to thank @HouseVetAffairs Leader @DrPhilRoe for his help to ensure that North Texas veterans could access newly-expanded services at the Denton VA, including critical mental health care resources. Watch here:
It was a pleasure to join #NHPC19 to discuss our @HouseCommerce accomplishments of the 115th Congress and outline a path forward to create better a health care system for American patients, physicians, and other health care providers.
My friend @RepWalterJones was a faithful public servant whose life reflected his deep commitment to helping his fellow North Carolinians and the American people. I extend my sympathies to his wife Joe Anne, their family, and the people of North Carolina’s 3rd District.
Thank you to the @FlowerMoundHS Debate Team for stopping by the @uscapitol to meet with me during your trip to Washington, D.C. It was a privilege to talk with these bright North Texas students on the Capitol steps.
.@EnergyCommerce Democrats refuse to hold a hearing on their extreme health care plan to strip Americans of private health insurance, force patients into single-payer government-run health care, cost taxpayers $32 trillion, end Medicare as we know it
This week I reintroduced H.R. 1040, the Flat Tax Act. Every Congress since 2003, I’ve introduced this commonsense legislation to ensure that all Americans pay their fair share in taxes. More:
Chairman John Dingell was a lifelong public servant and legislative giant. His matchless wisdom, persistence, and humor will be sorely missed in the halls of Congress, and especially in the Energy and Commerce Committee hearing room that bears his name.
Congress cannot bring back their loved ones, but my North Texas constituent Chris and other #AngelFamilies do deserve justice. We must act to protect the American people and defend our borders to prevent further heartbreak. #BorderSecurity
Under the Trump Administration, @SecAzar and @HHSGov are providing excellent care to the children entrusted to their custody. At today’s @EnergyCommerce hearing, we should recognize these public servants for their steadfast service to these children.
As a physician and a congressman, I take oversight of @HHSGov very seriously. Thanks to @HouseCommerce GOP’s efforts, unaccompanied children in ORR custody are now screened for medical, dental, and mental health, in addition to sexual abuse and vulnerability to #humantrafficking.
During the Obama Administration at the height of the unaccompanied minor crisis in 2014, I visited HHS ORR facilities and was horrified by the conditions I found.
Quite simply, it is downright inhumane to encourage families to make the dangerous journey to our southern border – often atop of La Bestia.
It’s always a pleasure to attend the National Prayer Breakfast, and I am glad that North Texans Vince and Mona Puente were able to join me for this outstanding event.
I was saddened to hear about Chairman @JohnDingell's health challenges. My thoughts and prayers are with my friend Energy and Commerce legend @JohnDingell and @RepDebDingell at this difficult time.
Encouraging families to make the treacherous journey across the desert to our southern border is not only wrong, it’s inhumane. #SOTU
This evening President @realDonaldTrump offered an optimistic message of hope and unity to the American people. My statement on tonight’s #SOTU:
While Democrats are working to force Americans into government-run, single-payer health care, I’m fighting to lower drug costs and make the health care system work for – and not against – American patients and doctors. #SOTU
President Trump is committed to protecting workers fighting unfair #trade deals by equalizing U.S. tariffs with those of other nations. Congress should ensure @POTUS has the ability to negotiate from a position of strength for the American people. #SOTU
Sovereign nations must define + defend their borders. As Commander-in-Chief, President Trump should have the resources he needs to defend the American people from gang violence, crime, drugs, and human trafficking. #SOTU #BorderSecurity
All of us can - and should - work together to choose greatness for our fellow Americans. From strengthening our national defense to protecting American workers and investing in our infrastructure, President @realDonaldTrump is committed to creating a better tomorrow.  #SOTU
Despite Democrats’ obstruction, @realDonaldTrump’s Administration and Republicans in Congress continue to deliver on our promises to the American people. #SOTU
It’s an honor to welcome U.S. veteran, Angel Dad, and TX-26 constituent Chris to attend tonight’s #SOTU.
Technology is playing an increasingly-vital role in the detection and prevention of disease, including the #flu. It was great to visit @TeladocHealth in Lewisville with Commissioner @BrendanCarrFCC to learn how Teladoc serves American patients from afar.
Today @FCC Commissioner @BrendanCarrFCC and I attended the opening of @ericsson's new Lewisville facility, which joins a number of North Texas companies that are leading the way in innovation for the 21st century.
Tomorrow morning, I'll join @MariaBartiromo at 6am CT/7am ET to preview President @realDonaldTrump’s #SOTU and more. Hope you’ll tune in.
Don’t let the queso sit out too long. @CDCgov has helpful tips for keeping your gameday snacks safe. #SuperBowlSunday
Thank you to the Greater Dallas Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce for inviting me to join its Chinese New Year celebration. I wish all who celebrate a happy, safe, and prosperous year ahead.
While Republicans focus on pro-growth policy, Democrats are fighting to strip hardworking Americans of their private insurance and force them into radical “one-size-fits-all” single-payer, government-run health care.
The excellent January #jobsreport not only indicates that 300,000+ more Americans have jobs, but also that more families have access to employer-sponsored health insurance - a far better option than #Obamacare marketplace or any other government-mandated coverage.
Thanks to @dentonisd leaders for visiting my D.C. office this week. We had a productive conversation about serving North Texas students.
Thanks to @MarkDavis for hosting me on his @660KSKY show this morning to discuss the fight for #bordersecurity and more. Listen in here:
As #HumanTraffickingPreventionMonth comes to a close, we remember the evils of human trafficking and highlight ways we can prevent abuse. Especially as we consider #bordersecurity, we must work to stop the trafficking that is spurred by irregular migration.
I’m coming up on the @MarkDavis Show on @660KSKY in a few moments. Tune in here:
Athletes who compete honestly never should have victory seized from them by those who have used performing-enhancing drugs. I introduced the bipartisan Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act to restore a level playing field for all clean U.S. international athletes.
It was a pleasure to join business and community leaders at the Flower Mound Chamber of Commerce on Friday. 
Today #WeRemember the innocent victims and survivors who faced evil, and we honor those who helped shine light in darkness. #HolocaustMemorialDay
It was great to meet with @cityofdentontx Mayor Chris Watts in my DC office this week. Mayor Watts and I had a productive conversation about our collaborative efforts on local priorities, including the Lewisville Dam.
President @realDonaldTrump has proven that he values the wellbeing of Americans over petty politics. In the coming days, @SpeakerPelosi should show up and work to find real solutions to defend our nation and provide stability for federal workers. My full statement:
Yesterday it was a privilege to catch up with Capt. Trey Gregory, who I nominated to attend the @NavalAcademy more than a decade ago, at the @uscapitol. Supporting North Texans who answer the call to serve our nation is an important part of my job, and I am grateful to them.
Today I joined President @realDonaldTrump at the @WhiteHouse to discuss the need for fair and balanced #trade that will bolster our economy and protect American workers. My statement:
It's always a pleasure to join @AmericanCancer at its annual You're Beautiful lunch to celebrate cancer fighters and survivors as America works toward a cure.
Under @SpeakerPelosi's leadership, the House has wasted 330+ hours on political stunts - all while federal employees go without pay. It's past time for @HouseDemocrats to come to the table for good faith negotiations to secure our borders and reopen the federal government.
Today I joined the @SouthwestAir family to celebrate the life of founder Herb Kelleher, who will be long remembered for his dedication to North Texas and his dogged determination to succeed where others could only see failure.
As America marks another anniversary of Roe v. Wade and its tragic consequences, we are reminded that life is a precious and sacred gift, and we must do all we can to protect it.
It was a privilege to join @UnitedWayDenton on Saturday to honor my friend Denton County Commissioner Bobbie Mitchell for her more than 30 years of dedicated service to North Texas.
More than fifty years after his death, Dr. King is remembered as a leader who dedicated his life to working toward justice, equality, and peace for all Americans. We are indebted to him. #MLKDay
President @realDonaldTrump has shown that he’s willing to come to the table and fulfill his promises to the American people. It’s time for @SpeakerPelosi and House Democrats to get serious about reopening the government and securing our borders.
This week, I had a productive meeting with @SBAList's Marilyn Musgrave on my work to promote commonsense #prolife policy. The fight for life is a team effort, and I am grateful to all who use their voices to help the most vulnerable among us. #WhyWeMarch
As a physician, my career was rooted in the truth that all life has meaningful potential. While my work has changed over the years-I now spend late nights on the House Floor instead of the delivery room-my dedication to #ProLife medicine remains steadfast.
I agree with President @realDonaldTrump. @SpeakerPelosi and @HouseDemocrats should stay in Washington until they reach a deal to reopen the government and secure American borders.
As I told @trish_regan, it's wrong to expect American taxpayers both to provide foreign aid to Central America and to care for unaccompanied children when they reach our borders. The simple fix? Americans must hold foreign leaders accountable for the well-being of their citizens.
I’m joining @trish_regan at 8pm ET. Tune in for our discussion on the Democrats’ unnecessary shutdown and their obstruction of the resources President @realDonaldTrump needs to defend our nation.
It is a privilege to serve as the top Republican on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health, and I am looking forward to leading our @HouseCommerce efforts to expand access to quality care, put patients first, and make health care affordable for the American people.
Last week the House passed @RepChrisSmith's legislation, which I co-sponsored, to appoint a new Special Envoy at the State Department to address the rise in anti-Semitism worldwide. I hope the Senate advances this bill to @POTUS' desk soon.
Former Tarrant County Commissioner Dionne Bagsby was a true trailblazer and dedicated public servant. Her legacy of steadfast service to her fellow North Texans will be long remembered in our community and beyond.
A century after the worst pandemic in our nation's history, the House now has passed the critical #PAHPA reauthorization three times. It's time for the Senate to prioritize the protection of American lives and send this bill to @POTUS' desk.
The last Administration clearly failed to fix what President Obama dubbed a humanitarian crisis in 2014. President @realDonaldTrump is committed to securing the southern border, and Congress must ensure he has the resources he needs to defend the nation.
#TBT: In 2014, President @BarackObama met with then-Gov. Rick Perry to discuss the flow of unaccompanied children crossing the southern border, yet refused to visit the border himself. As I've said since then, there's no substitute for showing up.
ICYMI: Yesterday morning I joined @ChrisSalcedoTX to talk about the #116thCongress and the critical need to secure American borders. Catch up here:
While @HouseDemocrats plan superfluous, symbolic votes, I’ll keep fighting to improve health care for the American people.
The shutdown should end, and the Democrats should stop their senseless obstruction of the #BorderSecurity we need to defend the nation.
On #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay, we honor those who protect and serve. I'm grateful for the law enforcement officers in North Texas, at the @uscapitol, and throughout our nation who prioritize their fellow citizens' safety ahead of their own. #BackTheBlue
As a Texan, I know firsthand that #BorderSecurity is national security. I joined @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria to discuss President @realDonaldTrump's address to the nation. Watch here:
President @realDonaldTrump recognizes the urgent situation on the southern border as the humanitarian and national security crisis it is. Now is the time to #SecureOurBorder. My full statement on the #TrumpAddress:
As I've said for 5 years, there's no substitute for showing up. The brave men and women of @CBP are public servants who know the challenges of the southern border better than anyone in Washington. I encourage @POTUS to ask for their wise counsel as he considers #BorderSecurity.
I’ve traveled to #McAllen, TX many times since 2014, and it’s only right for President @realdonaldtrump to see firsthand the urgent situation on the southern border. What the last Administration labeled a humanitarian crisis is now a National Emergency with consequences.
It is an honor to be appointed to serve on the House Rules Committee for the #116thCongress. I'm looking forward to working alongside Ranking Member @TomColeOK04, @RepRobWoodall, and @RepDLesko on important policy, and I'm grateful to @GOPLeader for the opportunity.
My friend @RepLizCheney is a trailblazer and steadfast leader for the people of Wyoming and her fellow Americans. I served with her on @RulesReps last Congress, and I’m grateful to have her at the helm of @HouseGOP as chair of the GOP Conference for the #116thCongress.
.@SouthwestAir co-founder Herb Kelleher's legacy includes vast contributions to North Texas our economy. It was a privilege to work alongside him and others to resolve the impasse known as the “Wright Amendment” several years ago. I'm grateful for his dedication to our region.
Despite what House Democrats are saying, the status quo on the southern border is simply unacceptable. As I told @MelissaAFrancis on @FoxBusiness last night, @HouseDemocrats should stop their senseless obstruction of the #bordersecurity that America needs.
Think Americans should be paying their fair share in taxes? There’s a flat tax for that. I plan to reintroduce this legislation in the #116thCongress.
Thanks to @HouseGOP and President @realdonaldtrump's pro-growth policies, the economy added 312,000 jobs last month. In the #116thCongress, I'll keep working to improve the economy for hardworking families in North Texas and beyond.
Today I took an oath to support and defend the U.S. Constitution as I serve the 26th District of Texas in the U.S. House. In the #116thCongress, I'll continue fighting to limit the role of government in Americans’ lives, strengthen national security, and bolster the economy.
I’m joining @FoxFriendsFirst bright and early this morning. Tune in at 5:30am ET as we discuss the critical need for #bordersecurity and what the #116thCongress will mean for President @realDonaldTrump’s Administration.
Yesterday I kicked off 2019 by swearing in Judge Bonnie Robison at the Denton County Courthouse. Congratulations and thank you for serving, Judge Robison.
As President @realDonaldTrump has said, Democrats are opposing #BorderSecurity for reasons that are purely political. This needs to end. Our national security is far too important for such illogical obstruction. Watch my discussion with @JulieBanderas:
I wish all North Texans a happy and safe New Year. #HappyNewYear
In 2018: I authored 18 bills, helped nearly 500 North Texans cut through red tape, gave 80+ media interviews, and traveled more than 6,000 miles in North Texas. Read more here:
I was glad to join @FoxNews yesterday morning to discuss the critical need for funding to secure America’s borders. Thanks to @pdoocy for recapping my interview on @OutnumberedFNC.
On this day in 1845, #Texas joined the union. As the song says, God bless you Texas!
Today I released my 2018 Year End Report, which recaps my work over the past year on behalf of TX-26. Read it here:
#TBT: This summer, I traveled to Central America to learn firsthand about the humanitarian challenges that spur families to send their children on the dangerous journey to reach our southern border. Read more:
I wish all North Texans a merry Christmas and a safe holiday season.
The defense of our nation must be Congress’ first priority. Period. I urge the Senate to join the House and pass H.R. 695, Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, which includes @POTUS’ requested funding to build a wall on our southern border protect the American people.
After months of bipartisan, bicameral work, I’m thrilled @POTUS has signed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act into law. For families in North Texas and around the U.S., this law has personal significance and I’m grateful to all who have contributed their voices to this effort.
A sovereign nation must define and defend its borders. This morning I joined Lt. Col. @AllenWest on the @MarkDavis Show to discuss my efforts to fund border security in the U.S. House. Listen here:
Last night in @RulesReps I stood up for President Trump’s priorities and, along with fellow members, delayed consideration of the Senate’s appropriations bill. We must find a path forward for @POTUS’ requested funding to build a wall on the southern border and defend our nation.
As Congress considers important legislation to reform the tax code, we should focus on policies that encourage – not discourage – American workers and our economy.
I’m joining @trish_regan on @FoxBusiness in a few moments to discuss a path forward to secure American borders.
Last week I visited @CDCgov to learn more about the agency's work on some of the most urgent health care challenges we're facing today, including maternal mortality, influenza, and #AFM. @CDCDirector and his team are working hard to protect the American people.
A century after the Spanish Influenza killed nearly 700,000 Americans and millions more worldwide, the Senate must complete its end of the bargain and pass the critical reauthorization of the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act. #PAHPA
President Trump has signed my bill, H.R. 315, into law. The Improving Access to Maternity Care Act will help deliver quality, consistent care to American mothers in North Texas and beyond. I am grateful to all who helped to steward this lifesaving law across the finish line.
American health care should put patients first. This morning I joined @MariaBartiromo on @MorningsMaria to discuss the latest ruling on #Obamacare and outline a way forward.
As I’ve said from the beginning, #Obamacare isn’t working for the American people. This ruling will be challenged; nevertheless, Congress should use this opportunity to deliver health reform that puts patients first.
Yesterday I had a productive conversation with @CDCgov Principal Deputy Director Dr. Anne Schuchat and @NIAIDNews Director Dr. Anthony Fauci about the recent uptick in acute flaccid myelitis (#AFM) cases as @housecommerce #SubHealth tracks its impact on American communities.
After months of bipartisan work to help our nation’s mothers, I’m grateful that the Senate has passed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018, sending it to @POTUS' desk to become the law of the land. Thanks to Rep. @HerreraBeutler for leading this lifesaving legislation.
I'm tracking the bomb threats made in North Texas. While thankfully all have been deemed non-credible, remember to stay vigilant. If you see something, say something.
In case you missed it, my bill to expand critical maternity care is headed to President Trump’s desk.
Today the House passed bipartisan, bicameral legislation to expand research and help Americans with sickle cell disease. I’m grateful to @RepDannyDavis, @SenTimScott, @SenBooker for their partnership on this critical legislation and I encourage @realDonaldTrump to sign it soon.
With today’s passage of the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018, the House has taken another step toward eliminating all preventable maternal deaths. Thanks to Rep. @HerreraBeutler for leading this work. Now, the Senate should pass this bill and send it to @POTUS’ desk.
Today on the House Floor, I had the privilege of managing debate for several critical health bills, including initiatives to end maternal mortality, combat sickle cell disease, prevent premature birth, and address traumatic brain injuries.
Congress must ensure President Trump has the resources he needs to defend our nation. I’m coming up on @FoxBusiness to discuss.
This morning, I will chair the third @housecommerce #SubHealth checkup on the 21st Century Cures Act. Watch here starting at 10:15am ET:
I’m heading down to the House Floor to pay tribute to President George H.W. Bush. Tune into @cspan to watch live.
Funding the #BorderWall at President @realDonaldTrump's requested level is important. The defense of our nation must be Congress' top priority. Our goal is not to end legal immigration, but rather to provide border security for our citizens. WATCH:
Grateful that, following yesterday's Senate passage, my bill to provide better access to maternity care is headed to President Trump's desk to become the law of the land.
On this 77th anniversary of #PearlHarbor, we remember the Americans who perished on that day and our nation's brave response to evil. I am grateful to the #WWII veterans members of the Greatest Generation who have exemplified love of country and dedication to do what is right.
Today marks one year since President @realDonaldTrump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel – fulfilling his promise to the American people and signaling strong support for our friend and ally.
This afternoon President George H.W. Bush is being carried to his final resting place at @Bush41Library by a train that bears his name, dubbed the “Air Force One of Railroads.” #Remembering41 #Bush41
It's an honor to join the Bush family and our fellow Americans to celebrate the exceptional life and legacy of President George H.W. Bush - an American hero, wise statesman, and humble giant among men. #Remembering41
On Thanksgiving, it was great to see North Texas students representing our region at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Congratulations to the @KellerISD and @NorthwestISD students who participated – all had a fantastic performance.
This afternoon President George H.W. Bush will arrive at the U.S. Capitol for the final time. After decades of service , President Bush will be just the 12th President to lie in state at the Capitol – a fitting honor for a great American.
It was good to talk with @JulieFineNBC5 and @ScottNBC5 late last week for yesterday's edition of Lone Star Politics. In case you missed it, you can catch up with our conversation here:
I wish all those who celebrate a safe and joyous #Hanukkah.
From the skies of the Pacific theater to the Yale baseball diamond to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to the streets of Beijing and the halls of the White House, President @GeorgeHWBush led a life of humble leadership, courage, and conviction. My statement:
Along with a grateful nation, I celebrate the life of former President George H.W. Bush, who lived out American values on the front lines of our nation’s history.
Thanks to @LizMacDonaldFOX for inviting me to join the @EveningEdit to talk about Congress’ efforts to secure American borders. Our current border fence is simply insufficient. It's time for a real solution.
The SMART IoT Act, passed by the House this week, will help America stay on the cutting edge of innovation. 
Relieved that my bill, H.R. 315 - the Improving Access to Maternity Care Act, has advanced through @GOPHELP. This legislation, passed by the House on 1/9/2017, will improve care for American moms and babies. It's imperative that the Senate take up this bill ASAP.
Congratulations to my fellow North Texan @RepKayGranger, the next top Republican of the House Appropriations Committee.
I’m coming up on the @ChrisSalcedoTX Show to talk about the critical need to secure American borders. Listen here:
I wholeheartedly agree with @bdomenech that @Jack owes @MeghanMcCain and her family an apology for Twitter's glaring mistake earlier this fall. It was the right thing to do in September, and it’s still the right thing to do today.
I’m on the House Floor speaking about legislation under consideration. You can follow along with my remarks on @cspan.
I had a productive conversation with @MariaBartiromo this morning about the critical need for border security. As a sovereign nation, America must define and defend its borders. It's time to #BuildTheWall.
I will continue to work alongside President @realdonaldtrump to secure America’s borders, restore order at ports of entry, and protect legitimate asylum seekers. Read my full statement on the #migrantcaravan:
Any misconduct in our U.S. Olympics community is simply unacceptable. Earlier this year, @HouseCommerce held a hearing with top Olympics officials. Here are the questions I asked about their plans to keep athletes safe.
ICYMI: It’s a special privilege to represent my fellow North Texans in Congress. Since January 2017, we have accomplished key goals to help Americans continue to succeed – from passing #taxreform to improving #healthcare and more.
As we reflect on the many blessings we enjoy as Americans, I give thanks for each constituent of TX-26. I wish you and your family a happy and safe #Thanksgiving.
I’m looking forward to watching @KellerISD students march in the Macy’s #Thanksgiving Day Parade tomorrow morning. Good luck to @KellerHighBand.
This year, @DeptofDefense completed its first-ever audit. After 5 years of working to hold the Pentagon accountable to American taxpayers, I am encouraged to see this step in the right direction. #TBT: Read my #AuditThePentagon oped with @GroverNorquist:
ICYMI: I joined @FoxNews to offer a path to secure American borders. WATCH:
As I said on @FoxNews yesterday, our rhetoric matters. It is wrong to encourage families to make the dangerous journey to our border without the benefit of citizenship. We must hold Central American leaders accountable for the wellbeing of their fellow citizens.
I’m monitoring the #AcuteFlaccidMyelitis situation, and appreciate @CDCDirector and @CDCgov's work to find answers for patients and families.
As Congress seeks to rebuild our Armed Forces, it is more important than ever to ensure that the DOD is working to meet its full potential. My amendment to #AuditThePentagon has been included in the #NDAA since 2015. My statement on @DeptofDefense’s first-ever audit:
The @DeptofDefense’s first-ever audit is a step in the right direction. For 5 years, I've been advocating to #AuditThePentagon. Taxpayers should know what we've bought, how much it cost, where it is, whether it's working, and what we need for the future.
It was a pleasure to help honor members of America's uniformed service who responded to the communities devastated by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma Maria. They courageously provided care to those in the wake of the storms for long after the flood waters receded. #JointServices #USPHS
On #RuralHealthDay, we reaffirm our commitment to ensuring that all Americans - regardless of where they live - have access to quality care. 
#TBT: As I wrote in @DentonRC earlier this year, a team effort fighting the flu can make a difference for our North Texas community and lead to brighter, healthier days ahead.
I'm looking forward to working with @GOPLeader McCarthy, Whip @SteveScalise Chair @RepLizCheney to keep delivering on our promises to the American people. I was encouraged by the show of unity when Rep. @Jim_Jordan congratulated Leader McCarthy. Now it's time to get to work.
Thanks to @dallasnews for sharing these helpful tips about avoiding the #flu. We can all do our part to help protect our family, friends, and North Texas neighbors.
Yesterday I had the privilege of joining students, teachers, and faculty at @McMathMS to pay tribute to North Texas veterans.  #VeteransDay
Thanks to @MariaBartiromo for inviting me on @FoxBusiness to talk #taxreform, border security, and the outlook for the 116th Congress.
On #VeteransDay, we honor those in North Texas and beyond who have fought to protect American freedom. Our veterans have made immense sacrifices to serve, and they deserve the upmost respect. It is in the sacrifice and service of our veterans that we see the American spirit.
A century after the end of World War I, we thank those throughout American history who have fought for our freedom. #VeteransDay
Today marks 243 years of @USMC courage, resolve, and dedication. Thank you for your service on land, sea, and air. #MarineCorpsBirthday
This afternoon, it was an honor to award the Congressional Veteran Commendation to five outstanding North Texas #veterans. Today and every day, I am grateful to those in North Texas and across the nation who have served our country. More:
Throwback: Read more about the Obama Administration’s move to block Americans’ access to an over-the-counter asthma inhaler. #TBT
In 2011, President Obama’s EPA banned a widely-used inhaler. Thanks to Dr. @SGottliebFDA + @US_FDA, this over-the-counter medicine has been restored. After years of fighting for this move, I am glad to see this win for American asthma patients.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress, and I look forward to serving North Texas in the 116th Congress.
I agree with Senator @JohnCornyn. Thank you for your long service to Alabama, the U.S. Senate, and our country, AG Sessions.
Last winter, @SecretaryAcosta came to TX-26 to visit the future home of a North Texas veteran – U.S. Army SPC Daniel Dumas – and his family. I consider the privilege of serving North Texas #veterans one of the most important parts of my job.
America can be compassionate and America can define + defend its borders. It’s time to hold the leaders of Central American countries responsible for the wellbeing of their fellow citizens, and stop the cycle that leads to irregular migration.
Rep. Sam Johnson, who will retire at the end of the 115th Congress, spent nearly seven years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. In February, I spoke on the House Floor in honor of my fellow Texan's 45th "Returniversary." @SamsPressShop
Less than a year after President @realDonaldTrump signed #taxreform into law, we’ve experienced record-breaking economic growth. In October, our economy added 250,000 jobs.
American consumers should know how @facebook uses their data. In April, I had the opportunity to ask Mark Zuckerberg. WATCH our conversation here:
