America’s sheriffs have called this proposal "dangerous." Taking away resources that allow our agents to do their jobs is detrimental to national security and public safety. This doesn't strengthen our immigration system or help funding negotiations.
First they wanted to abolish ICE. Now Dems are proposing caps to the number of beds at ICE detention facilities. This would hamper the ability of agents to keep illegal immigrants, including those with criminal records, from being released into the U.S.
