Today is a historic day in the people’s House. The passage of #HR1 will drastically reform how Congress and our government operates - taking power away from special interests to empower the American people.
Congratulations to my friend and colleague @RepDebHaaland! Every day you serve in Congress, you show an entire generation of young people how much they can accomplish when they follow their dreams.
One-in-three Native American women experience sexual assault in their lifetimes. The Violence Against Women Act provides critical funding to tribes to investigate and prosecute violence in all forms, ensuring all survivors have access to the safety and justice they deserve.
Today, as we honor and remember those who sacrificed their own safety to guarantee the right to vote for all Americans, my colleague @repjohnlewis is absolutely right - there is much more work to be done to secure the rights of all people.
Too many Americans have lost their faith in their government. House Democrats committed to the American people that we would fundamentally change Washington if elected to the majority. #HR1 is the first step in fulfilling that commitment.
Republicans are more interested in picking partisan fights than in making sure families have health care.But that won't stop Democrats from fighting to lower health care costs for the American people.
Democrats on @EnergyCommerce plan to tackle an ambitious agenda this Congress - lowering health care costs for everyone, taking action to fight climate change making sure everyone living in our country is able to reach their full potential. Our budget should reflect that goal.
Thrilled to see the history-making women of the 116th Congress in the spotlight. These powerhouse legislators are already shaking up Congress for the better!

My friend @SenatorTomUdall is right. Living in border states like New Mexico we know @realdonaldtrump’s hateful portrayal of our communities isn't based in reality. And he’s correct that this isn't about the president’s wall: this is about the constitution
Unconstitutional power grab request denied.
In recent years we've seen the right to vote come under relentless attack time and time again. This week, House Democrats took action by introducing the Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore our ability to combat voter discrimination across the country.
Voting is a fundamental right for all Americans and it should be far easier to participate in our democracy. I applaud New Mexico for taking steps to ensure every eligible voter's voice can be heard.
New Mexico’s stunning landscapes are part of who we are as a community. I’m proud to have helped pass the Natural Resources Management Act this week, which will safeguard the Cerro del Yuta and Rio San Antonio and preserve what truly makes our state the Land of Enchantment.

When faced with mass shooting after mass shooting, Republicans had one response: thoughts and prayers. Today, House Democrats chose policy and action.

It was an honor to receive this award. Years before the opioid epidemic was declared a national crisis, it was public and local media that shined a bright light on the dark ways opioids were devastating our communities. Please know this: your work has made a difference.

It’s disappointing that as Congress moved forward with a compromise today, the President insisted on declaring a national emergency because he didn’t get his way. If the President proceeds with this declaration, it will be an abuse of power that will be challenged by Congress.

I’ll let you get back to twitter things, but thanks for reading. Health care is complicated, yes, but it deserves the time and attention to get it right because health care is a right for all, not a privilege for a few.
I appreciate the time people have put into making the State Public Option Act a thoughtful way to expand coverage lower costs. A special thanks to @ASlavitt with @USofCare for coming out to New Mexico to eat chile and talk about how we can use #MedicaidBuyIn to expand coverage!
We’ve seen tremendous progress around #MedicaidBuyIn in New Mexico. @NMRepArmstrong Sen. Ortiz y Pino introduced a bill and @NMT4HC is hard at work making it a reality, while @ManattHealth has done research showing that 80,000 New Mexicans would become eligible for coverage.
The State Public Option Act would make real strides in our fight for universal coverage. That’s why 14 states are already considering #MedicaidBuyIn to close coverage gaps and save families money.
The State Public Option Act strengthens women’s health services. Thanks to @AllAboveAll @PPFA @ACLU and others for working with us to make sure abortion care is covered. As we move toward universal coverage, women cannot be left behind.
The State Public Option Act strengthens the Medicaid program. It includes a bump in reimbursement rates for family med, internal med, pediatrics, OB-GYNs, FQHCs, and rural clinics. This bump is not just for the buy-in population. This will increase participation in the program.
The State Public Option Act also increases affordability. This bill fixes the family glitch, making more middle class families eligible for tax credits. People can then take their tax credits and buy a Medicaid plan so no parent has to choose between rent and a doctor’s visit.
The State Public Option Act strengthens the ACA by enabling states to sell Medicaid plans on the exchanges. Does your state have too few plans? Do you worry about your county not having coverage? #MedicaidBuyIn increases competition and decreases cost.
Our State Public Option Act gives states the ability to remove income requirements from Medicaid so anyone can buy a plan. It’s a public option. I’ve supported the public option since I was voting on the ACA in 2010 because I believe that health care is a right, not a privilege.
The ACA, Medicaid expansion, and protections for pre-existing conditions have expanded coverage and lowered prices for millions of Americans. But 30 million people still don’t have coverage. That’s not okay.
Today @SenBrianSchatz and I - with over 50 other Members of the House and Senate - are reintroducing the State Public Option Act, aka #MedicaidBuyIn. This bill expands health coverage and lowers costs.
The President’s failure to get his way on his ridiculous border wall is not an emergency. The only emergency at the border is the humanitarian crisis caused by President Trump himself. Declaring a national emergency now is an abuse of power and a misuse of emergency declarations.

It was an honor to address the New Mexico State Legislature today. Our partnership at the local, state and federal level is critical to our shared prosperity. My hope is that when we sit down at the negotiating table this year, we remember that we're working toward a common good.
A group of inventive Mescalero Apache School middle schoolers have created an app to teach their language to the next generation! In the process they got to learn about technology from their teacher and about their culture from tribal elders.

Social Security is the insurance you’ve paid for. Without it nearly half of women over 65 and 46 percent of Hispanic seniors would live in poverty. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor #Secure2100 to increases benefits and ensure #SocialSecurity will be there for future generations.

New Mexico is leading the way with this legislation. Looking forward to working with @SenBrianSchatz to introduce the State Public Option Act on the federal level.
