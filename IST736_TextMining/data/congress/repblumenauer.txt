And I thank you @busproject for your leadership making sure every eligible voter can exercise their right!
Women are equal valued members of society, w/o exception.  That means we will not allow their fundamental human rights to be cast aside. We must fight for private public sector transparency so we can close the #WageGap.  #ReproRightsAreHumanRights #InternationalWomensDay
As someone who started their career working to lower the voting age protect voting rights, today's passage of #HR1 was very moving. I'm proud to fight for the Oregon model of automatic voter registration paper ballots nationwide. We must ensure our democracy is #ForThePeople
Enjoyed speaking with Captain America, @ChrisEvans, about marijuana reform, voting rights, and bipartisanship in times of division in the nation's capital. I can do this all day!
I told @RepDebHaaland that I hope commenting about her presiding over the House can be a daily social media event. It makes me feel better about this institution and my colleagues.
Remarkable moment. Proud to have supported @RepDebHaaland from the beginning. Looking forward to witnessing the amazing work she will continue to do.
I’m pleased to support @youthvgov the brave Juliana plaintiffs fighting for the future of our planet. Along w/ other Members of Congress, I submitted an amicus brief to the Ninth Circuit to urge that it allow the youth climate lawsuit proceed to trial.
Domestic sexual violence incidents are often underreported. Thanks to the Violence Against Women Act, reporting among survivors has increased criminal justice responses to gender-based violence have improved. We MUST reauthorize #VAWA to respect protect survivors of abuse.
Shameful.  We must protect these special creatures because once they’re gone, that’s it.  There won’t be a second chance.
#NetNeutrality is a free speech issue, an economic issue an issue of equity. There shouldn’t be a high-speed fast lane for some that leaves everyone else behind.  It's time to restore net neutrality. #SaveTheNet
After 8 years 404 committee meetings, today the @WaysMeansCmte  Democratic leadership did what the @GOP refused—hold a hearing on how to finance the rebuilding and renewing of America.  We must be willing to continue listening to the American people to MEET this challenge.
Seems to me that the ones who are most nervous about this ruling are the ones with something to hide... Transparency is the first step to real progress in actually closing this #WageGap.
Communities of all sizes are demanding better transportation options to get to work and it is past time that the federal government provides the flexibility and incentives needed to encourage the bike community.
We must offer more transportation choices that are better for the environment, cheaper for families and incentivize burning calories, not carbon. That’s why I worked with @VernBuchanan @RepPressley to introduce a bill that restores improves the bicycle commuter tax benefit.
This is bad.Good thing the newly confirmed EPA administrator was a former coal lobbyist. He’ll definitely know all the evasion tricks and stalling techniques.
The more @realDonaldTrump continues to promote climate denial, the more people will be put at risk. We MUST take bold action.
Every community that has been devastated by a natural disaster should receive A+ treatment, including Puerto Rico California. And in order to get A+ treatment, $10 million should probably not have been taken from FEMA and given to ICE to fund inhumane family separation.
Today @RonWyden and I met w/ Oregonians impacted by the #GOPTaxScam. Families depending on their returns for household expenses, education, medical bills now face smaller returns, penalties or fines b/c of this political stunt.  Sadly, this will be the norm across the country.
This is a disgrace. Trump has no regard for national security, no respect for the office of president and no clue how to lead.  This trending hashtag is past due. #FireKushner
The marijuana reform bills introduced in just the first few months of this Congress show that the end of prohibition is in sight. There will never be another president elected who is anti-cannabis. The sooner both parties get on board, the better it will be for the country.
Today was the first step of many to #EndGunViolence by passing #HR8 for universal background checks. This movement has provided a better Congress given us leadership that leads, instead of thoughts and prayers with no progress. We MUST treat this public health crisis.
Some of us have the best healthcare in the world, but on average, Americans get sick more often, they take longer to get well, and they die sooner. I’m proud to join @RepJayapal and 100 of our colleagues in supporting #MedicareForAll.
I just voted with my colleagues to pass a resolution to end Trump's #FakeEmergency.Hopefully this reminds him of some things.1.) There is no emergency at the southern border 2.) The Constitution includes a separation of powers3.) He is not a dictator
Voting is the foundation of our democracy. Ever since the Voting Rights Act was gutted, people around the country have been denied the right to vote. We're fighting to make progress nationwide by introducing H.R. 4 to #RestoreTheVote
Oregon's public lands are what make our state so special. I'm voting YES on the #PublicLands package because it makes #LWCF permanent protects over 2 million acres of iconic places, including several in Oregon.The only question is what took the @GOP so long?
Today I joined my dear friend @GabbyGiffords passionate young activists for a historic press conference ahead of the #HR8 vote for universal background checks tomorrow. The movement to end gun violence is gaining momentum all across the country. We must stop this epidemic.
#FakeEmergency
Everyone should have access to health care, no matter what. I'm proud to be leading the effort for universal care with @RepJayapal and over 100 of our colleagues. The time is now. #MedicareForAll

My bill with @RepMcGovern fixes this loophole. We need experts in charge of protecting the future of our pollinators, not insiders from the industries they are supposed to regulate. #ProtectPollinators
When @realDonaldTrump's border wall rhetoric meets the reality of his budget and enforcement priorities, guess who loses... the fight against human trafficking.  Once again, Trump talks big and short changes important priorities. 
One in three bites you eat every day come from pollinators. Their decline is a dire threat to our food safety and security. We MUST act to #ProtectPollinators and #ProtectOurFood.
This unsurprising news makes it even more clear that Trump is increasingly acting alone.  And that he’ll stop at nothing to undermine his own agencies.  Must be awfully lonely out there on your island of denial, Trump. 
Nasty Women strike again.  Thanks, @NWGSDPDX, for the stylish #InOurAmerica bow tie!
Don’t panic, take action — on the Green New Deal, resilient infrastructure, and real agriculture reform.  #ActOnClimate #GreenNewDeal
This morning, @BlueStarDonuts, Sen. @RonWyden, and I celebrated the legalization of hemp by unveiling the new hemp-based CBD donut!  It’s a delicious win for our country, highlighting only one of the many versatile ways that hemp can now be used.
If Trump can call a national emergency for a fake crisis at the border, then surely Congress should call a national emergency for the very REAL crisis that is climate change. That's why I'm introducing a resolution to declare a national emergency on the climate crisis.
@AxelRugger I
I don't think emergencies are optional. They also aren't normally followed by a weekend getaway to a Florida golf resort.That's not how it works. This is just a wildly unrealistic attempt at fulfilling an unpopular campaign slogan. #FakeTrumpEmergency

Today, I will observe a moment of silence at 2:22 PM to remember the victims.We must never forget the 17 lives lost that day and honor them with action to end the nationwide epidemic of gun violence. #NeverForget #NeverAgain
One year ago, a senseless act of gun violence at Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS shook the community of Parkland, FL the entire country.Gun violence in this country is far too common. We are making sure this Congress is the one to finally address it. #MSDStrong

The Trump admin continues to put industry before the people. We can no longer allow big phrama to decide the fate of your prescription drug prices. We must allow Medicare to negotiate on behalf of patients and combat the skyrocketing cost of Rx drugs. #EndRxMonopolyPrices
Outside @HouseJudiciary today was a crowd of passionate gun violence activists. This is what democracy looks like. Shockingly, this is the first hearing in the House on gun violence in years. Dems in charge make a difference. I'm proud to support #HR8 to end this epidemic.
For 8 years, the GOP talked about cutting benefits Americans earned through decades of hard work. Dems are serious about solving the social security crisis today's @WaysMeansCmte hearing was the first step. We must fulfill the promise of a retirement with dignity security.
Many other significant concerns with provisions relating to the environment, labor, and enforcement all need strengthening. Trying to force consideration of this trade deal prematurely is not a recipe for success.
Talking to other members, my strong first impression is that there’s a lot of work needed on access and cost of Rx drugs in NAFTA 2.0 to get committee support and House passage.

Thank you @RepTawnaSanchez for uplifting the voices of Oregon’s Native American community and speaking out about the impact of this #TrumpShutdown.
@oregonfoodbank wants to make this clear — if you’re a federal employee in Oregon who is furloughed or working without pay, the food bank welcomes you with open arms and wants to help. You do NOT have to go without food security.  #TrumpShutdown
My colleagues, @RepTawnaSanchez, and I are at the @oregonfoodbank today to highlight the efforts from our local community to do what Trump refuses to do — support our federal employees and their families. #TrumpShutdown
Trump’s admin already abdicated their duty to protect animals, but #TrumpShutdown is makes it worse: licensed animal shelters are going un-inspected, no oversight of horse shows, farm animals being slaughtered w/o a guarantee of being handled humanely.
The humanitarian crisis that is the White House grows more more each day. Someone who mistakes 3K migrant children as drug dealers is a person who desperately needs help. We need to handle this issue w/ compassion, not a border wall. End #TrumpShutdown, #FamiliesBelongTogether
Damn straight! #Trumpshutdown
More than 9500 federal employees in OR haven't received paychecks since the shutdown, and now many are turning to food stamps, food banks, and/or unemployment claims to make ends meet. The #TrumpShutdown has gone on too long.
While some states are doing the right thing, the fed. govt also has a duty to ensure we’re lifting American families out of poverty. That's why my Dem. colleagues I have intro'd a bill today to increase the federal min. wage to $15/hr by 2024. #ForThePeople #RaisetheWage (2/2)
Nowhere in our country can a person working 40 hrs/week at the current federal min. wage afford a 1- or 2-bedroom apartment w/o public assistance. It's been 10 years since the federal min. wage was last raised.  It's time for Congress to act now. #ForThePeople #RaiseTheWage (1/2)

BREAKING NEWS: GOP leaders finally acknowledge Steve King as the blatant racist he is. The question is...what took them so long? He has been spewing hate for years.
Healthcare is a right, not a privilege.  It's indisputable that drug prices are too high.  Congress must redouble the efforts to not only lower prescription costs for American families, but to also refine and advance proposals like #MedicareforAll #ForThePeople.
With more than 800,000 federal employees who are furloughed or working without pay, the last thing on WH officials’ minds should be a raise.  Congress must ensure that all political pay raises are halted until Trump re-opens the government.  #TrumpShutdown

Day 21 of #TrumpShutdown, liar-in-chief wants to divert $$ from recovery funds for #PuertoRico other areas to put towards his fantasy “crisis”. Sure 3K Americans died in PR, but it’s nothing compared to the thousands of Trump’s make believe terrorists crossing the border. (1/2)
Highlight of my day was meeting with @sunrisemvmt to talk next steps on #GreenNewDeal.
Everytime one of these reports come out, we keep finding out the same thing: climate disruption is real, we have even less time than we think, and we need action. #GreenNewDeal   
Because of this #TrumpShutdown, the FDA isn't able to inspect the food that our families eat, leaving them in harm's way...all because of an ineffective wall that the majority of Americans do not want.

Sorry to be on a plane to DC and unable to witness this historic event in person, but pleased to support @JoAnnPDX, Portland’s 1st black woman on City Council, in the election and eager to watch her make a difference. Congrats on being sworn in today! #StandWithJoAnn

On this #TrumpShutdown Sunday, remember that dedicated federal employees in my district across the country are prohibited from taking previously scheduled vacation over the holidays w/ family. All because Trump is delusional throwing a temper tantrum. Outrageous unfair.

� @realDonaldTrump, didn't you say you would be "proud to shut it down" on national TV 10 days ago?There's a no return policy on this shutdown gift. You've given us 2 this year already.Democrats don’t want it. Republicans don’t want it. The American people don’t want it.
What a fitting way for this GOP led Congress to end. Nothing has changed. Trump is delusional. The wall is still a non-starter.Fund the government.
