This action sets a dangerous precedent and opens the door for future abuse of power. Building the wall is not a national emergency, and I strongly disagree with the President taking that action.
Make no mistake, the constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. The attempt by this President to circumvent Congress to pay for a campaign promise--that he said Mexico would pay for--is a gross overstep of the constitutional powers provided to the Executive Branch.
I'm pleased the President signed the bill, our federal government will remain open, and federal workers will continue to receive the pay they deserve. Unfortunately, the President cannot resist the urge to create chaos where none is needed.
