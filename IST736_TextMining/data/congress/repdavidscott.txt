Enjoyed meeting with Rockdale County Commission Chairman Oz Nesbitt today in Washington.
I just voted against the #GOPbudget that hikes taxes on hard-working families cuts Medicaid Medicare to give the rich huge tax cuts.
Watch: My remarks questioning how can we fix the #EquifaxDataBreach problem when execs skip Congressional hearing.
