This is a major victory for Nevadans and for everyone who cares about the safety of our communities. Congratulations to the #NVLeg and @GovSisolak on a job well done. Now it’s time for Congress to pass #HR8 to expand background checks and reduce gun violence nationally.
When discussing his illegal plan to build the wall, Trump just admitted, "I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster."Does that sound like a legitimate national emergency to anyone? It certainly doesn't to me. I bet it won't to the courts either.
Declaring a national emergency to build a costly, ineffective border wall is illegal and a grotesque abuse of power.
I'll work with my colleagues to pursue all possible legal and legislative remedies to prevent President Trump from constructing this vanity project. The symbol of America must always remain the Statue of Liberty, not a border wall. (2/2)
Donald Trump's claim that there is a crisis at the border is simply not true. Declaring a national emergency to build a costly, ineffective border wall is illegal and a grotesque abuse of power. (1/2)
