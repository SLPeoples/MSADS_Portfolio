I was proud to lead the effort in Congress to provide historic funding for community health centers like Klamath Health Partnership, so they can continue serving our rural communities in Oregon.
Honored to participate in a ribbon cutting ceremony on this snowy day in Klamath Falls for the new school-based health center at Mazama High School. Led by Klamath Health Partnership, the new center will help provide easy access to quality care for Mazama students.
Great to meet Dana Jung, Brandon VanMeter, and Nolan Britton, three outstanding students from southern Oregon I nominated to our nation’s prestigious service academies. If you are interested in applying to the U.S. service academies, visit my website &gt;&gt;
RT @SecAFOfficial: @repgregwalden Thank you sir!
@SecAFOfficial Thank you, @SecAFOfficial, for your service and leadership at #USAF. It was an honor to work with you and introduce you to the hardworking men and women serving our country in uniform at Kingsley Field Air National Guard Base in Klamath Falls.
The $93 tril. Green New Deal will drive up electricity costs by 22%. As Democrats are marching forward with this plan, @HouseCommerce Republicans are committed to finding solutions to lower energy costs for American consumers.
I had the great privilege to get to know her when she and my father served together in the legislature in the 70s. She leaves behind a vibrant and full chapter in the book of Oregon’s great leaders.
She cared deeply about the environment, public integrity, Oregon history and quality public service.
Oregon lost a real treasure with the passing of Norma Paulus.  She had a spirit and enthusiasm seldom seen in public service.  She didn’t just break ground for Oregon women, she shattered barriers.  And she did it all with a certain flair and a smile.
We need to come together around bipartisan #climatesolutions that ensure America leads the way with innovation, adaptation, conservation to protect the environment create jobs right here at home.
People have the right to know exactly how this would impact their lives before we have to vote on it. This is why I asked the Democratic leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committee to hold a hearing on this bill three weeks ago, and I renew that call today.
We know a takeover of our health care system would cost $32 trillion and kick 150 million Americans off their union and employer health insurance plans.
Here it is, a government-run, single-payer health care bill has been introduced, and yet there is still no promise we are going to give it appropriate review at Energy and Commerce.
We all know someone who has been hurt by the #opioidcrisis - a friend, neighbor, or loved one. Combating this scourge requires an all-hands-on-deck approach. That's why H.R. 6 gives more tools to those on the front lines of this fight in our communities:
It's great to return to @AEI to continue an important discussion with @slsatel on combating the #opioidcrisis. We have made real progress in this fight, but there's much more work to be done to stem the tide of addiction save lives. Tune in live here &gt;&gt;
The reemergence of measles in OR WA has alarmed people throughout the country, presents a public health threat in our communities. Today, @HouseCommerce is examining efforts to boost awareness education about the importance of getting vaccinated to prevent future outbreaks.
I feel blessed to have known and worked with him for so many years.  Mylene and I are sending our prayers to Cathy and their children.  Dennis served his country with honor and his body of work leaves Oregon better for the next generation.
I am so saddened to learn of Secretary of State Dennis Richardson’s passing.  Dennis was such a kind, caring and thoughtful friend.  A wonderful public servant, and a deeply loving husband and parent.  Dennis’ quiet competence and civility is such a rarity in today's world.
Honored to receive the Public Service Award from @publicpowerorg today. I look forward to our continued partnership to strengthen America’s economy, protect our environment, modernize the way we power our communities.
More than 5,000 people in central Oregon are looking to Congress to help reduce the threat of wildfire surrounding their homes. Today, we answered their calls for action with the passage of this commonsense, bipartisan bill. Learn more &gt;&gt;
The Crooked River Ranch Fire Protection Act is essential to saving lives in central Oregon. With another wildfire season just on the horizon, the people of Crooked River Ranch are deeply concerned that they could become the next Paradise, California.
Congress should work together toward a bipartisan federal privacy bill that: •improves transparency, accountability, and security for consumers; •protects innovation and small businesses; and, •sets one national standard. 
After just completing my 10th town hall of the year, I am excited to continue my series of town halls with meetings in Hood River, The Dalles, and Hermiston in March. Learn more about my upcoming town hall schedule here &gt;&gt;

Enjoyed the discussion in Boardman during my 158th town hall meeting since 2012. Now speaking before the Pendleton Rotary Club about the great progress we made for Oregon over the last two years and the work ahead in the new Congress.
Starting off this Presidents’ Day with a town hall in Morrow County - my 10th town hall this year. Thank you to the Cub Scouts of Pack 602 and Boy Scouts of Troop 602 for welcoming me to Boardman this morning.
Congress has granted the executive branch certain spending authorities. I strongly object to any president acting outside of those explicit authorities to spend money that Congress has not appropriated for specific initiatives.
While I consistently support efforts to strengthen border security -- and voted just yesterday for additional physical barriers on our southern border that President Trump requested -- I am deeply concerned about the precedent that this action sets.
The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse. Just as I opposed President Obama’s spending of taxpayer dollars without Congressional authorization, today’s action by President Trump raises serious concerns about the Constitution’s separation of powers.
Happy 160th birthday to the great State of Oregon from Ted Team Walden!

Congress should focus on lowering health care costs for consumers, increasing patient choice, giving states greater flexibility for innovation to keep health care affordable. Democrat plan? Force more than 150 mil. Americans off their plan into a government-run system.
After completing nine town halls so far this year, I am excited to continue my town hall schedule next week in Morrow County. You can find further details on my upcoming town hall in Boardman here:
While we made great strides together last Congress, our work to combat the #opioidcrisis is far from over. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to stem the tide of addiction save lives in our communities.
A winter’s day in the Gorge! 84 was icy and slushy from Hood River to Bonneville Dam. Thanks to ODOT workers who were busy plowing.
Fort Rock--after completing my 157th town hall since 2012. It's my 9th in Lake County in the last six years.  Excellent turnout today! Enjoyed the discussion.
Underway here in North Lake County for my 9th town hall of the year. Looking forward to a productive discussion.
On our way to North Lake County for our next town hall!   27 degrees and light snow falling south of Bend.
My thoughts and prayers are with his beloved wife, Debbie, as well as the entire Dingell family, friends, and all of his incredibly loyal staff. The Dean left a mark on all of us; his was a life well lived. Rest in Peace, John.
The U.S. House of Representatives and the nation lost one of its most faithful servants. John Dingell, the Dean, was a giant in Congress for decades – a true man of the House. He loved this institution; he loved the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Congress must act to pass bipartisan, permanent #NetNeutrality rules into law. Today I introduced a bill to do just that while making sure the internet continues to flourish under a light touch regulatory regime &gt;&gt;
What’s the cost of a $32 trillion one-size-fits-all, government-run health care system?Eliminates private/employer-sponsored insurance for more than 158 mil. Americans.Raids Medicare funding for seniors.Largest tax increase in American history.#WhoPaysForM4A?
@HouseCommerce Republicans are focused on energy solutions that prioritize adaptation, conservation, innovation. We can adapt America’s power portfolio in a way that benefits both our economy AND our environment.

Four days. Hundreds of miles. Eight town halls. 1,700 Oregonians. Check out my latest newsletter to learn more about my recent town hall meetings in Grants Pass, Medford, Klamath Falls, Bend, Madras, Prineville, Burns, and Ontario.
Now it’s time for Congress to come together with the president on long term, bipartisan solutions to secure our borders and thwart illegal immigration.
I’m pleased that important work like forest management projects in our district will resume if this deal moves forward. I will continue to support efforts to reopen the government, put our federal employees back to work, and resume the vital services of government agencies.
This tentative agreement reached by Congressional leaders and President Trump is welcome news for federal employees and their families in Oregon who have been hurt by this partial shutdown.
Thanks to the residents of Malheur County for a productive and thoughtful conversation on the issues impacting our community at my town hall meeting in Ontario today.
Thanks to the Cub Scouts of Pack 467 in Ontario for welcoming me to Malheur County for my 156th town hall meeting!
Good morning from Harney County where I am holding the first of two town hall meetings in eastern Oregon today. Thank you to everyone for joining our meeting in Burns on this #MartinLutherKingJrDay.
On the road again...just east of Brothers on the way to Burns for town hall number 155 since 2012.
Heading to eastern Oregon now for town halls in Burns and Ontario tomorrow.
Protecting our Second Amendment rights, reopening the federal government, securing our borders, and bringing bipartisanship back to Washington, D.C. were all part of a good discussion in Prineville for my second town hall of the day.
Starting the day with a town hall meeting in Madras. Looking forward to a great discussion before heading to Prineville for another town hall this afternoon.
Thanks to everyone who joined me in Bend for my 152nd town hall meeting. Heading to Madras and Prineville tomorrow for two more town hall meetings in central Oregon.
Underway here in Medford for my second town hall this morning. Providing a quick update on my recent work in Congress to combat the opioid crisis, improve forest management, and get Oregon veterans the care and support they deserve at the VA.
At my town hall in Medford today, I was proud to present Nancy with a copy of the legislation we worked together to pass into law to fully fund community health centers like La Clinica for two years. Thank you for all you do for our community, Nancy.
Nancy Cavanaugh and her entire team at La Clinica in Medford do great work providing essential health care services to people in southern Oregon.
Thank you to everyone who joined my town hall in Grants Pass this morning for a productive and thoughtful discussion. On to Medford now for my second of three town halls today.
That’s why I voted alongside my colleagues to remove Mr. King from his committee assignments tonight. I join all Americans in condemning his comments and am proud of the action taken to make it clear that we will not tolerate this blatant disregard for common decency.
Racism, bigotry, and prejudice have no place in America, where we hold true that all men and women are created equal. The comments of Steve King are reprehensible and unbecoming of any person, much less an elected representative.
As federal workers in Oregon and across the country are having their pay withheld, Members of Congress should be treated no differently. I have sent a letter to the House Chief Administrative Officer requesting that my pay be withheld during this shutdown.

Merry Christmas! Proud to have an Oregon Christmas tree at our nation’s Capitol.  Please join Mylene and me in thanking our men and women in uniform, and their families, for their service to our country during this holiday season.
When we’re losing towns, and people, and firefighters, and our communities are choked with smoke each year from wildfires, we need to redouble our efforts to improve forest management. Our communities deserve better.

Beautiful afternoon in the Klamath Basin. Looking forward to Air Force Secretary Wilson’s visit to Kingsley Field this weekend.
BREAKING: The economy added 250,000 jobs in October. Wages are rising, unemployment is lowest in decades, and middle class families in Oregon and across the country are keeping more of their hard earned money because of the economic polices passed by Republicans in Congress.

Human trafficking is a scourge that has afflicted communities across our country, including right here in Oregon. Today in La Grande, I met with survivors, law enforcement, and local leaders to discuss how we can combat human trafficking and protect our communities.
It was likely in wagons like these that my great-great grandparents crossed the Oregon Trail and arrived in The Dalles this week in 1845.
Thank you to the community leaders and interested members of the public from across eastern Oregon for meeting with me this morning in Baker City to discuss your concerns about how our communities will be negatively impacted by this plan if it is not changed.
The objections raised by farmers, ranchers, and local leaders in eastern Oregon about the Blue Mountain Forest Plan are serious and must be considered before any proposal is put into place.
This is an important step forward in our fight to end this epidemic that takes 115 American lives every day. Victims and families in Oregon cannot wait any longer, and I look forward to continuing to work to advance a final legislative package that will be signed into law.

Oregonians are experiencing terrible air quality choking on smoke from wildfires. Today, our hearing will examine the health impacts of this smoke, discuss how we can improve forest management to prevent unnaturally catastrophic wildfires that we are battling once again.
17 years later, and the promise of all Americans to #NeverForget 9/11/2001 remains steadfast. Today we honor those we lost, remember the bravery of the firemen, first responders, every day people who became heroes that day helping their fellow Americans in the face of evil.

I join all Americans in mourning the passing of John McCain and thanking him for his tremendous service to our country. Mylene and I send our heartfelt condolences and prayers to the entire McCain family during this difficult time.
America lost a true icon today. John McCain devoted his life to the service of others. From his bravery in Vietnam, to his dedication to the people of Arizona in the House and Senate, John McCain was a true hero who exemplified what it means to be a public servant.
The Americans who’ve worn our nation’s uniform are owed our profound gratitude. I was honored to recognize 28 veterans of the Korean War in Warm Springs today for their service and for answering ‘the call to defend a country they never knew and a people they never met.’

For too long, the United States has faced a gap in military readiness that left our country and our allies less safe. This legislation helps fill that gap and ensures America’s armed forces remain capable defenders of freedom and liberty around the world.
Oregon produce and livestock are some of the best in the world. Appreciate @SGottliebFDA visiting with our local producers about some of the many challenges they face as they work hard to produce safe, reliable, and affordable products for Oregon families.

We cannot allow any country to undermine our right to free and fair elections, and I will continue to support efforts to combat Russian aggression against the very bedrock of our principles and values as Americans.
That is why I voted for unprecedented sanctions against the Russian regime, which the President has signed into law, to send the clear signal that these actions are unacceptable.
As I have said repeatedly, I fully support the findings of the hardworking Americans in our intelligence community that Russia deliberately attacked our democratic process and continues its hostile efforts against our country and our allies.
Russia’s interference in our elections and repeated attempts to subvert democracy in America must be condemned by our country’s leaders.
