Passing H.R. 1 is a reflection of those basic values and should not be a partisan issue. This bill isn’t perfect, but the good far outweighs the bad.
Big money in politics, voter suppression, and gerrymandering have put our country at risk. Our job is to protect our democracy and secure our elections. We do that by ensuring that all eligible voters have the opportunity to voice their opinions.

Thanks @myTDOT for the site visit of the mudslide in North Nashville today. The engineers and crew are working around the clock to get the interstate reopened.
It’s official. Cumberland River Hospital is the latest hospital to close due to Tennessee not expanding Medicaid – the most per capita of any state in the country. This isn’t a ranking we should be proud of. The effects are setting
I encourage you to visit the Civil Rights Room at the downtown @NowatNPL or take a Civil Rights walking tour to draw inspiration for working toward a more just and civil society.
The lunch counter sit-ins and Freedom Rides, led by students who would later become iconic leaders in the movement, were pivotal moments that ultimately led to desegregation of all public facilities in Nashville and inspired protests across the South.
As Black History Month draws to a close, let us all remember the significant role that Nashville played during the Civil Rights Movement.
Ninety percent of Americans support expanded background checks for gun purchases. Criminals, domestic abusers, and the mentally ill should not be permitted to legally obtain guns. Now it’s up the Senate to do the right thing.

While Senate passage is also likely, Trump is certain to veto the measure. Not enough Republicans are willing to do the right thing and stand up to Trump, so a veto override will likely fail. It will probably be up to the courts to keep his power in check.

I’m glad that the state legislature is interested in helping expand health care coverage in TN, but they really should consider expanding Medicaid. We’ve already turned down billions of dollars that would help give more Tennesseans access to health care.
David Williams was a giant. He was a friend and mentor to so many. Martha and I were lucky enough to have David and Gail as friends. We are devastated.

The President only invoked security concerns because he didn’t want to negotiate with Congress, even a Republican Congress. But the Constitution requires negotiation.
President Trump’s own Secretary of Defense, Gen. Mattis, said that Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum were not due to security concerns. I trust a Marine General like Mattis on this.
Presidents are sometimes tempted to declare a national security emergency when there is, in fact, no danger. This has, unfortunately, happened with trade policy.
I am cosponsoring the Bicameral Congressional Trade Authority Act of 2019, which requires Congress to pre-approve tariffs impacting national security and limit eligible goods to materials used in military equipment, energy resources, and critical infrastructure.
It’s official. We’ve hit double digits - the most per capita in the country. Meanwhile, our state legislature can’t muster the energy to even follow other solidly Republican states (NE, ID, UT). Expanding Medicaid would help our hospitals and countless Tennesseans.
Local news is essential to our democracy.
Agree with my former colleague, who also served as OMB Director, WH Chief of Staff, and Sec of Defense. This is why Congress should pass
It’s good the government will reopen so people can get paid and back to work. But Congress still has a job to do to make sure this doesn’t happen again in three weeks. We need to find a sensible solution so that shutdowns never happen. #NoBudgetNoPay
It is an honor to serve Middle Tennessee.
It is an honor to be appointed chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. I look forward to leading this important work and keeping America safe from external and internal threats.
The House has now voted 10 times to end the shutdown. It’s now up to the Senate. It’s time to reopen the government and get people back to work. My #NoBudgetNoPay bill would stop members from being paid if they don’t do their jobs and fix this shutdown problem for good.
I am cosponsoring the Incentivizing Medicaid Expansion Act of 2019, which would increase the matching funds a state receives when the state expands its Medicaid program. This bill would give Tennessee zero excuses not expand Medicaid.
Remembering the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and grateful for the Nashville leaders who carry on his message today.
The Republicans did the right thing in stripping Steve King of his committee assignments, and I would support further censure. He would save everyone a lot of trouble if he just resigned, as his fellow Republicans and his hometown paper are urging him to do.
Racism, white supremacy, intolerance, and hate have no place anywhere in America.
RT @MargaretRenkl: The quality of mercy is not strained. Via @nytopinion:
Congress and the White House need to pass No Budget No Pay so that this never happens again.
The House and Senate did the right thing and passed a bill to ensure federal workers impacted by the shutdown will eventually get paid. But it doesn't help them right now, and the government should not have shut down in the first place.
Thank you @RepCummings! I am proud to support this effort and I look forward to our Committee tackling, among other important topics, the serious opioid problem plaguing Tennessee.
I am proud to add 4 more Tennesseans to my staff that truly understand Middle Tennessee and the needs of the 5th
The best way to resolve the dispute and reopen government is to stop paying Congress and the White House negotiators so that they are treated like the furloughed government workers. My No Budget, No Pay bill should become law again.
We need to better police the massive entry points like Laredo, El Paso, and San Diego where thousands of trucks move every day, often hiding drugs and people.
There are better, cheaper ways to secure our borders than by spending $5 billion on a longer wall on our Southern border, when we already have 700+ miles of wall.
Thank you, Governor Haslam. You did the right thing. Cyntoia Brown's case was tragic.
This bill would prevent House and Senate members from receiving their salary if they miss annual deadlines for budget and appropriations bills, and would force members to work together to pass bipartisan legislation and prevent damaging government shutdowns.
Yesterday I reintroduced No Budget, No Pay. Congress is the only place in America where you can get paid for showing up, but not doing your work. I'd rather reward members for good behavior, but the reality is when you take away their pay, Congress finds a way to do its job.
Now that the House has done its job and passed bills to reopen the government, the Senate should follow suit. Congress should never let the government shut down. America is the greatest nation on earth, and it is embarrassing we are so poorly managed.
Voters ought to be able to choose their elected officials—not the other way around. The redistricting process is rigged and we need to fix it.
Only 20% of House districts are considered competitive and the number of “swing seats” has dwindled to a record low of 72 out of 435. On the flip side, more than 58% of House districts are considered extremely partisan.
Today I reintroduced two bills to reform the redistricting process. These bills would increase transparency and significantly limit the secretive practice of gerrymandering.
I hope our new House leadership will chart a sensible course, and show all of America that we are up to the job.
We should use this opportunity to help all Americans have a brighter future. If we do a good job getting America back on track, we will more likely win the White House and a majority-Democratic U.S. Senate in 2020.
This is the way America’s 200-year-old two-party system of checks and balances is supposed to work: speaking truth to power and competing to help the average voter.
I am very excited about the new Democratic majority. Finally, the Republican monopoly on power in Washington is over. Now, one half of one of the three branches of government will be able to stand up to President Trump when he is wrong.
Today I voted “present” in the vote for Speaker of the House, consistent with my eight-year push for new Democratic leadership. Now that we are back in the majority, I did not vote for a rival candidate because there are none.
New Congress, more representative of our nation than ever before. We have a lot to do so let’s get to work.
President Trump said he would be “proud” to shut down the government if he didn't get what he wanted from a Republican-led Congress. He then made a deal that he has now abandoned. This chaos does not make America great; it puts our nation in danger.
He always puts the safety of Americans and our military first. Sadly, the President has pushed him aside because they disagree on Syria. I worry the White House meeting rooms will soon be vacant of adults.
General Mattis is an outstanding General, SecDef, and hero who had enough respect for our country to continue serving, even under difficult circumstances.
The fact that Putin is supportive of this decision should be an indication that it is an alarming idea.
Revealing our military strategy to everyone in the world, including our enemies, is an avoidable error Trump himself has mocked in the past.
We also should not abandon our Kurdish allies who have been working tirelessly beside us in the fight against ISIS.
President Trump’s decision to withdraw American troops from Syria is impulsive and irresponsible. National security experts believe ISIS is still a threat, and the removal of our troops will create a power vacuum in the Middle East.
I hope and pray Gov. Haslam will commute Cyntoia Brown’s sentence.
I have been a supporter of taking politics out of the redistricting process for many years.  Voters ought to be able to choose their elected officials – not the other way around.

If he doesn't, I hope other Tennessee cities will quickly follow Nashville's lead. Nationwide, our state is in the minority. Not a good look.
Post-election audits are best conducted by paper ballots. All Tennessee counties should follow suit, and Sec. Hargett should require it by making paper-ballot machines the only option on the approved state purchasing list.
Proud and grateful that the Davidson County Election Commission is adopting voting machines with voter-verifiable paper audit trails. This extra layer of security will give Nashvillians greater faith in the integrity of our elections.

On the world stage, President Trump said he believes Vladimir Putin over our own intelligence agencies. Another disgraceful embarrassment that all Republicans should denounce, but likely won’t. Why?
Most importantly, people are sick of nominees who may look good on TV, but seem programmed to stealthily turn back the clock on our individual rights. Kavanaugh was already rejected twice by the Senate in 2003 and 2005 for judgeships; I doubt he will be confirmed this time.
