@Ilhan @WhipClyburn @HouseDemocrats In the strongest possible terms, I condemn these actions from both Omar and Clyburn, and I look forward to voting YES on #HRes183, condemning anti-Semitism across the USA and the world.
@Ilhan @WhipClyburn Clyburn violates the memory of those who survived the Holocaust, the millions who were killed, and those who carry their legacy to future generations. This is unacceptable from a @HouseDemocrats leader.
@Ilhan @WhipClyburn The Holocaust was a systematic attack on the Jewish people with the intent to eliminate an entire race of people from the planet. It remains one of the worst and deadliest atrocities in the history of humankind.
@Ilhan Yesterday, @WhipClyburn made inexcusable comments to justify Omar's anti-Semitism, sending a slap in the face to the descendants of Holocaust survivors.
#HR1 is so bad, even @ACLU is opposed.
If you want to learn more about #HR1 and why it's bad for Americans, @GOPLeader made a great video explaining the bill. Watch it here -&gt;
#HR1 is riddled with flaws. It puts our election system at risk of fraud is unthinkably expensive. My biggest objection is to the unconstitutional dangerous limitations this bill puts on our right to free speech.This bill is #ForthePoliticians and no one else.
Anti-Semitism is AGAIN at the forefront of the national discussion this week, because of vile comments from the SAME person who caused the drama last time. @Ilhan's anti-Israel insults have no place in our country. America is and always will be Israel's strongest friend!

The consequences of Congressional inaction will be detrimental to the next generation and the country we hand down to them.
@RepAndyBiggsAZ Anyone who isn't alarmed by the $22 TRILLION national debt is living in a fantasy world. Fiscal responsibility is at the core of a well-protected and secure nation. With unchecked federal spending and no balanced budget, we put the safety of every American at risk.
I'm proud to be an original cosponsor on a bill released yesterday by my friend @RepAndyBiggsAZ recognizing that our national debt is a true threat to our national security. It’s long past time for Congress to get our spending under control address the ballooning national debt.
@Dylan_hurt_4 @USMC Thank you for your service! ��
This is a clear sign of just how far @TheDemocrats are willing to go to stand in the way of @realDonaldTrump We must hold these senators responsible for this vote.
The national debate on horrific late-term abortion and post-delivery #Infanticide is moving the needle on how people in our country view abortion.Everyone who voted against this bill tonight is supporting the grotesque practice of killing babies post-delivery.
Did you know that in the last month, since Democrat support of #Infanticide was brought to light, the number of Americans identifying as #ProChoice has dropped by 8 percent. That's a HUGE dip in just one month.
This bill would have protected children who were born alive or survived an abortion attempt.
The #Senate just voted on a bill to protect the lives of our children - the vote FAILED. This is appalling.

Even more alarming is that they don't offer a solid plan on how to pay for these monstrous, socialist plans. @HouseDemocrats are out of touch and out of their depth with their plans for the #GreenNewDeal
A few of the absurd points are to eliminate air travel completely, upgrade or replace EVERY building in the United States of America, plant "lots" of trees, and put charging stations "everywhere".#GreenNewDeal
This isn't a parody, this is the real text of their proposal.#GreenNewDeal
Don't take my word for it, here are some direct quotes:"we aren't sure we'll be able to fully get rid of farting cows and airplanes that fast..." question isn't how we'll pay for it, but what we'll do with our new shared prosperity"#GreenNewDeal

The #shutdown is now on Day 34 - the longest in American history. Instead of staying here and working to reopen the government, @SpeakerPelosi canceled votes for tomorrow and sent Members home early today. How are we supposed to reopen the government when Congress isn't working?
Just gave a speech on the House floor calling out @HouseDemocrats for voting against a measure to fund the paychecks for federal employees who have been impacted by the partial #shutdown. This is the 2nd time they've voted against it. Time to stop the games do our job.

Great talking with @PC1170 this morning on @KFAQ! Did you catch the interview?
When will we say enough is enough? More than ever, border security is my priority as we work to reopen the government and take care of the American people.
This sad news of a police officer in California killed by an illegal immigrant is just another instance where Democrat policies - like sanctuary cities and open borders - are protecting criminals instead of the American people.
Once again, hardworking Americans are put in danger because of our inability to control illegal entry at our borders.
I hope this incentivizes my colleagues in Congress to make the safety of Americans their top priority.
Members of Congress should not be paid during that time either.
If we can’t come to an agreement on government funding and there is a lapse in appropriations, hundreds of thousands of federal employees around the country will be furloughed or working without pay.
I’m proud to introduce a bill with my colleagues - in the event of a shutdown, Members of Congress should not get paid.
RT @NBCNews: BREAKING: Speaker Ryan says President Trump will not sign short-term continuing resolution passed by Senate.
(3/3) The longer we let it go on, the harder it will be to recover and move on as a society. Mueller needs to wrap it up and realize what millions of Americans have known for a long time now: if there was something to find, he'd have found it by now.
(2/3) This needless waste of taxpayer dollars must end. The never-ending political circus in Washington has been fueled by this fruitless investigation, deepening the divides between our lawmakers.
(1/3) Since Robert Mueller began investigating @realDonaldTrump, it has cost the American taxpayers over $300,000 a week - adding up to $25 million.After 19 months of this, it's clear the investigation is going nowhere.
