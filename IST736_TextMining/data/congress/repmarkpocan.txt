With the passage of the #ForThePeople Act, @HouseDemocrats are making our government more ethical, expanding the right to vote, ensuring transparency by our elected leaders, and ending the out-of-control influence of big money in politics.
Today, the swamp in Washington took the most direct hit that it has experienced in decades when @HouseDemocrats voted to restore power to the American people, clean up the #CultureOfCorruption in Washington, and reform our democracy.
Come for the debate on #Nickleback.Stay for the important points on prison gerrymandering, which swells the population count of communities and distorts representation at local and state
