I am committed to continuing the investigation into the Administration’s family separation policy, and will monitor ORR’s reunification efforts closely.
Our government should have never inflicted this government-sanctioned child abuse on these children in the first place—let alone created a situation where some children may be permanently orphaned. That is cruel.
Judge Sabraw made the right decision by requiring ORR to identify children who have been separated from their families and reunify them. It is unconscionable that the government argued it would be unfair for them to have to do this.
Through sweeping campaign finance reform, #HR1 takes power away from the corporations the corrupt and gives it back to the American people, where it belongs.

Medicaid varies from state-to-state. That’s why Medicare for America sets a high floor for benefits and services covered under the plan. If states continue to decide what benefits are covered, the inequalities in our healthcare system will persist.
This is appalling, and raises serious questions that the Trump Administration needs to answer. As Chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds HHS and the unaccompanied children program, I am committed to getting to the bottom of this. -Rosa
There's so much more to say about Medicare for America. Looking forward to the robust debate and sharing more about the plan as we (w/ @janschakowsky) get ready to reintroduce it this Congress.
On employer-sponsored insurance: some people love theirs, others don’t. Our solution: if employers offer gold level coverage, great! If not, they either have to or they can put their employees on #Med4America and make a contribution. And workers can always choose #Med4America.
It also tackles the Hyde Amendment. Under #Med4America we ensure all reproductive health care is covered. We're also able to end Hyde-like riders for the Indian Health Service, women's veterans healthcare, and health care in ICE detention facilities.
#Med4America also includes Long-Term Services Supports as a part of the universal service package. We cannot have a conversation about universal coverage if we do not include robust home and community-based LTSS.
Like its benefits package. Healthcare should not be determined by your zip code. Unfortunately in our current system it is. #Med4America sets a high threshold for benefits so that all Americans get the same covered benefits and services.
Thanks for highlighting Medicare for America @jonfavs! There’s a lot to like about it. (THREAD)

.@HouseDemocrats have laid out a reasonable path forward to reopen the government—one that is supported Members of Congress in both chambers and both parties. This manufactured crisis has gone on long enough.
The federal government plays a key role in people’s everyday lives, and President Trump has selfishly put people’s livelihoods at risk in order to score political points. It is time for President Trump to end his shutdown.
Hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors—many of whom are living paycheck to paycheck—are furloughed or working without pay. Routine food safety inspections have been halted, and the list goes on.
Americans desperately want to end this shutdown. As we enter its third week, critical food assistance is at risk for our most vulnerable citizens—including children, seniors, and veterans.
Tonight, President Trump doubled down on heated rhetoric and lies regarding his manufactured crisis at the border. Instead of governing responsibly, he has taken our government hostage in order to make good on an empty campaign slogan. That is unacceptable.
People will go hungry because of a tantrum by the President. That is why I led a letter with 128 @HouseDemocrats demanding answers from the Trump Administration. The President must put the interests of the American people above that of his own ego.
President Trump’s decision to shut the government down is coming at the expense of working families, the middle class, and the most vulnerable. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program—our nation’s leading anti-hunger program—is on the precipice of massive benefits cuts.

People who are food insecure deserve access to food, not further stigmatization.
The Administration’s own data shows millions of Americans will be at risk of going hungry and cut SNAP by billions of dollars. Instead of listening to the will of the American people, Secretary Purdue has decided to jam through a regulation that punishes people for being poor.
The USDA proposal betrays decades of bipartisan support for SNAP. The President's cruelty couldn't be clearer: passing trillions in tax cuts for billionaires corporations with massive giveaways to corporate agribusinesses—while taking food assistance away from the unemployed.
From exorbitant premiums and deductibles to skimpy plans that do not cover the essentials, healthcare in America is complex and costly. An individual’s zip code should not determine their benefits. Every American deserves coverage they can afford and that meets their needs.
This bill achieves universal coverage while preserving quality employer-sponsored insurance for those who have it and are satisfied. Americans who are uninsured or do not have employer-sponsored insurance would be auto-enrolled into Medicare for America.
Medicare for America also includes coverage for prescription drugs, dental, vision, and hearing services, as well as long-term supports and services for seniors and Americans living with disabilities.
Today I introduced the Medicare for America Act with @RepSchakowsky. This bill ensures universal, high-quality, affordable health coverage by making Medicare accessible to all Americans and expanding the program’s covered benefits and services.
While the latest news from HHS is a positive step toward beginning to unravel its misguided fingerprinting policy, the heart of this harmful policy is still in place. I will not sit back and enable this Administration’s harmful child abuse policies.
President Trump and Secretary DeVos’s School Safety Commission Report fails to advance solutions to keep students safe. Our nation’s children and their families deserve action, not empty rhetoric as the Trump administration gives a gift to the gun lobby.
