One of the most effective ways to hold down drug costs is thru competition. I’m proud to cosponsor the Biologic Patent Transparency Act to increase transparency break down barriers that discourage efforts to promote lower-cost generic alternatives.
In 2017, #Equifax failed to protect the sensitive info of more than 145M Americans. This week, as chair of the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, I questioned #Equifax leaders as well as security experts about how to ensure this never happens again. 
The #opioidcrisis has devastated many #Ohio families. Our bipartisan legislation #CARA, #CURES #STOPAct are working to combat this epidemic, but there’s still work to be done. I’ll continue to work w/ local leaders experts on solutions.
Earlier this week, @GM shut down the #Lordstown Plant. The world-class workers at this plant, and their families, deserve better I will continue to push @GM to bring new production to the plant.
Conservation leaders across #Ohio are praising our bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act. This is needed legislation to help preserve protect our #NationalParks, including the 8 national sites in #Ohio. #NationalParks
One of my favorite pastimes is visiting #NationalParks w/ my family. The memories of our trips to our nation’s treasures always brought so much joy. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help ensure that future generations can enjoy our parks.
Yesterday the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, which I chair, held a hearing based on my new bipartisan report that details the repeated failures of #Equifax to protect sensitive information of more than 145M Americans.
It’s #TrueBlueFriday. Wearing blue in my 2014 visit to #Lordstown. For decades, these dedicated workers have given so much to @GM the community. I will continue to do everything I can to support them their families. #DriveItHomeOhio
Following her daughter’s tragic death, Yvonee Ambrose was a tireless advocate for changing the laws to hold Backpage and others accountable for enabling online sex trafficking. This guilty verdict for Desiree’s trafficker demonstrates justice being
Happy #InternationalWomenDay! I’m lucky to have many strong, inspiring women who have helped shape my life. Most especially, my mother who provided unconditional love unwavering support.
A new @CLE_State study on the economic impact of the #Lordstown plant says ~7,711 #jobs were lost w/ 2 shift losses plant closure. Also had $1.6B econ impact on the region. Not too late for @GM to do the right thing bring new production to the plant.
This week the #Senate confirmed two highly-qualified #Ohio nominees to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Over the last 2 yrs, the Senate has confirmed 89 judicial nominees, including 34 circuit judges 2 #SCOTUS. Real progress for our country.
His leadership in the Jewish community was legendary and a source of inspiration. After an extraordinary life of nearly a century, Sam will live on through the legacy of all he accomplished in business, philanthropy, and for his community.
Jane and I mourn the loss of Sam Miller, a remarkable man who touched the lives of so many in Cleveland and around the world. Sam was a friend who always offered a wise word and on how to make the world a better place.
My opening statement this morning at the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations hearing w/ @SenatorCarper examining #Equifax’s repeated failures to protect the sensitive info of more than 145M Americans:
Great to chat answer questions with students yesterday from Toronto High School Edison High School in town with the @CloseUp_DC program! #Ohio
Today in Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, will hold a bipartisan hearing on private sector data breaches. Tune in at 10am for my opening remarks our questions for #Equifax the other witnesses:
Pleased to join my Buckeye colleagues friends to celebrate #Ohio's 216th birthday this evening! O-H-I-O!!
Ohioans, please join me in standing against intolerance and hate let @DaytonPolice know if you recognize the individual in the surveillance photos at this #Dayton mosque. Together we can stand for the welcoming, peaceful place we all know #Ohio to be.
Congratulations to the 2019 #Ohio delegates for the @SenateYouth program: Navkiran from Streetsboro and Grace from Copley. #USSYP
Today on @CNN I expressed my disappointment frustration about @GM’s decision to shut down production in #Lordstown, #POTUS’ proposal to strengthen US border security holding Kim Jong Un accountable for the horrible mistreatment of Otto Warmbier:
Another great turnout at our #BuckeyeCoffee this morning. I always enjoy hearing from constituents about issues affecting #Ohio. This morning we discussed the opioid crisis, trafficking, immigration, organ donation more.
Last night I spoke on the @SenateFloor to highlight the progress being made in #Ohio to combat the #opioidcrisis human trafficking. I’ve led efforts to pass bipartisan legislation in the #Senate like #CARA, #CURES, #STOPAct, and #SESTA to help
Proud to have received the @NABHbehavioral’s Legislative Champion award for my work to combat the #opioidcrisis, including our successful effort to lift the #IMD exclusion to expand access to treatment.
I will continue to press @GM to recommit to #Lordstown, do the right thing by these workers who have given so much to this company, and bring new production to this plant.
.@GM says it will produce new 20 new electric vehicles by 2023. Then one of those vehicles should be built in Lordstown. #Ohio #jobs
I remain incredibly frustrated and disappointed with @GM’s decision, but I’m not giving up on the #Lordstown plant and these workers. #Ohio #jobs
.@GM’s decision to shut down production at the plant not only impacts #Lordstown workers their families, but thousands of others in the Mahoning Valley who work for suppliers other businesses that support the plant. #Ohio #jobs
For the first time in nearly 100 years, @GM will not have an assembly plant in #Ohio, so this is a sad day for our state. For decades, workers in the Mahoning Valley made a commitment to #GM this company should recommit to them.
Another way #taxreform is helping families: Utility companies passing on tax savings to lower your electric bill! More good news here for many families in #Ohio Kentucky
I introduced bipartisan legislation with @SenatorTomUdall today promoting wildlife conservation by ensuring the US Postal Service sells the approx. 50M remaining Saving Vanishing Species Stamps.
Women have played an important part in the history of #Ohio. Lucy Stone Harriet Beecher Stowe changed the nation through the abolitionist movement much more. This #WomensHistoryMonth I want to honor all women who’ve already helped to shape #Ohio’s history the ones that will
This morning on @FoxNews, I talked with @BillHemmer about the administration’s border security proposal my support for holding Kim Jong Un his regime accountable for their horrible mistreatment of Otto Warmbier.
Good read in the @WSJ about how women are driving the labor force comeback #jobs #taxreform
I’m not giving up on the #Lordstown plant and its world-class workerforce. @GM says it is going to produce 20 new electric vehicles by 2023. Great, build one in Lordstown!
The workers at the Lordstown @GM plant deserve better. For decades the men women of the Mahoning Valley have made a commitment to @GM. It’s time for GM to recommit to them.
It is outrageous that the government is paying drug manufacturers for drugs that are literally being thrown away. I introduced the bipartisan #REFUNDAct that would enable Medicare to recoup $$ from drug companies provide savings for seniors taxpayers.
My bipartisan Trade Security Act will ensure Section 232 trade law is used as originally intended, only when there is a genuine national security threat. I’m proud of the praise it has received from #Ohio national business leaders.
Good read from @WSJ about how #taxreform and regulatory relief boosted economic growth in 2018, creating increased investment, higher wages, and more #jobs.
More than 100 American colleges universities host Confucius Institutes which are controlled, funded, mostly staffed by the Chinese Government. The lack of transparency reciprocity at these institutes is concerning should be immediately addressed.
Proud of the support my bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act has received from #Ohio conservation leaders. The 8 #Ohio National Park sites are vital to our state’s rich history tourism. My legislation will help to preserve protect them. #NationalParks
I’m working to reform the Section 232 trade law to ensure it is not misused in a way that harms Ohio #jobs the economy. Pleased my bipartisan Trade Security Act is receiving significant support.
My legislation, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, was signed into law earlier this year and is expanded to include coral reef ecosystems for the first time. 60% of the worlds coral reefs are under threat.
Today is #WorldWildlifeDay to raise awareness and help protect the worlds most threatened species. My resolution with Sen. @ChrisCoons highlights this year’s theme: #LifeBelowWater.
As the self-described supreme leader of #NorthKorea, I find it impossible to believe Kim Jung Un was unaware of the terrible mistreatment of Otto Warmbier. The blame for Otto’s death lies solely with this brutal regime.
It’s vital we have transparency regarding Chinese government-funded Confucius Institutes in the US. Following my PSI Subcmte’s hearing on #China’s impact on the U.S. education system, @usedgov committed to issue new guidance on US universities receiving reporting foreign funds.
Last week the #House passed my bipartisan bill that ensures the #Ohio Canalway is protected. The canal holds a great significance to #Ohio, supports local #jobs economic development. I look forward to the President signing it into law soon
My bipartisan #REFUNDAct would help improve health care outcomes save seniors taxpayers billions in prescription drug costs by reducing wasteful spending on discarded medications. We should only pay for products patients actually use.
“O say does that Star-Spangled Banner yet wave, o’er the land of the free and the home of the brave!” I love those words. You will recognize them as the closing words of the song that was adopted as our National Anthem 88 years ago, on March 3, 1931. Happy #NationalAnthemDay
#LakeErie serves as an important habitat for migratory birds birding contributes more than $20M to #Ohio’s economy. I urge @POTUS to sign my Migratory Birds of Americas Conservation Act into law soon to protect preserve these animals.
My bipartisan E-Verify Act will require employers to use this important program to ensure legal workers are hired. The current program is optional allows too many people circumvent the law by using fraudulent identity documents.
I will continue to make clear that absent full transparency regarding how Confucius Institutes operate here in America full reciprocity for U.S. cultural outreach efforts in #China, they should not continue in the US
The Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, which I chair, released a new report this week highlighting the lack of transparency on how Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes operate in the US lack of full reciprocity for US cultural outreach efforts in #China
On the @SenateFloor this week, I honored the memory of Otto Warmbier. We can never forget the cruel inhumane treatment that led to his death. We must remember the responsibility of his death lies solely w/ this brutal regime dictator, Kim Jung Un
As an avid outdoorsman, I enjoy trips to all of Ohio’s #NationalParks w/ my family. Our national treasures must to be maintained so that they can be enjoyed by generations to come. My Restore Our Parks Act aims to ensure this happens.
Pleased to see such strong support for my bipartisan Trade Security Act from national #Ohio business groups.  We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable but do so in a way that protects US #jobs.
One of my favorite memories about being a dad was reading aloud to our three children. It helped to mold  and shape their love of reading. On this #ReadAcrossAmerica day, I encourage everyone to dive into a good book!
147 years ago today, President Grant signed the @YellowStoneNPS Protection Act into law, thus creating the @NatlParkService America’s first national park. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help ensure that our #NationalParks can thrive for another 147 years more.
Our #NatlParks are our nation's most precious national treasures my bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help maintain these important landmarks for future generations to enjoy. Proud of the support this act has received from #Ohio conservation leaders:
17th state admitted to the union, #1 in our hearts. #HappyBirthdayOhio! 216 years has never looked so good.
There are more 100 Confucius Institutes at U.S. colleges in the United States, yet the Chinese government shut down @StateDept public diplomacy efforts in China.  We must ensure reciprocal access—in both trade and in public diplomacy.
The Chinese government also funds programs at K-12 schools, called Confucius Classrooms.  My Permanent Subcmte on Investigations report shows the growth of Confucius Classrooms around the world:
Some U.S. schools’ contracts with the Chinese government are confidential.  That can’t be.  We need to have transparency so students and faculty know when funding comes from the Chinese government.
The @usedgov @StateDept made commitments to PSI yesterday to issue new guidance to the more than 3,000 schools nationwide about reporting foreign gov’t fundings to do more to ensure visas are properly used at Confucius Institutes.
I also chaired a hearing on this new report, which highlights the lack of transparency reciprocity of #China’s Confucius Institutes at more than 100 American colleges universities.
I spoke on the @SenateFloor yesterday about the new report from the Permanent Subcmte of Investigation, which I chair, on China’s impact on the US education system.
We must not and will not ever forget Otto and we must assign responsibility directly to the brutal regime and the dictator, Kim Jong Un.
...with a long history of cruelty and despicable human rights abuses. I am glad that #POTUS walked away from a bad deal; we should not remove sanctions until there are real, verifiable changes in behavior in #NorthKorea.
I do believe we must engage with #NorthKorea on human rights abuses and in an effort to achieve a negotiated, verifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But we must do so with a clear eye understanding that Kim is a brutal dictator...
Kim Jong Un is an autocrat with a long record of human rights abuses. As I said yesterday, we cannot be naïve about the brutality of the Kim regime and the human rights abuses that continue to this day.
As the self-described supreme leader of #NorthKorea, I find it impossible to believe that dictator Kim Jung Un did not know about the horrible mistreatment of Otto Warmbier while he was wrongfully imprisoned in #NorthKorea.
Yesterday, I spoke on the Senate Floor reminding us of what happened to Otto Warmbier. Otto was an Ohioan and a college student who was wrongly imprisoned by #NorthKorea and subjected to cruel and inhumane treatment that led to his death.
Tonight Jane and I attended the @CincyChamber annual dinner honoring the 2019 class of Great Living Cincinnatians, including my friend Joe Head. Great to see so many friends.
I have stood with the Warmbier’s and will continue to do so.
On the @SenateFloor this afternoon I honored the life of #Ohioan Otto Warmbier urged everyone not to forget the brutal nature of #NorthKorea’s regime. We can’t be naïve about what they did to Otto what their gov’t continues to do to their own people.
Glad I had the opportunity to chat with @WalshUniversity students this afternoon. Their thoughts and ideas for the future are inspiring and I look forward to their future successes.
Always enjoyable to talk with #Ohio University College Republicans (@OUCRs). They’re a great group of students and future leaders!
Following PSI’s hearing on China’s Impact on the U.S. Education System, @usedgov committed to issue new guidance on U.S. universities receiving and reporting foreign funds, including from China. Transparency is key.
It is my belief that absent full transparency regarding how Confucius Institutes operate full reciprocity for U.S. cultural outreach efforts on Chinese campuses, Confucius Institutes should not continue in the United States.
Confucius Institutes are located at more than 100 American colleges and universities and are controlled, funded, mostly staffed by the Chinese Government. This morning I expressed my concern over their lack of transparency reciprocity.
This morning the Permanent Subcmte on Investigations, which I chair, held a hearing to examine #China’s impact on the US Education System primarily though Confucius Institutes. Here is my opening statement:
This morning I’m chairing a PSI hearing to examine China’s impact on the US education system. Yesterday we unveiled a bipartisan report that details the lack of transparency in how Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes are managed. Watch here:
Spoke at the National Park Foundation reception this evening about my #CentennialAct to leverage public private partnerships to protect our #natlparks. Unfortunately there’s still a $12B maintenance backlog I’m urging my colleagues to pass my bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act.
Productive meeting with @MAGNETOhio today to discuss the need to close the skills gap in #Ohio. My bipartisan #JOBSAct will expand eligibility for Pell Grants to help students get the skills training they need to fill today’s in-demand #jobs.
.@cindymccain’s dedicated service to ending human trafficking both in the US around the world is inspiring. She was instrumental in helping my bipartisan #SESTA become law I’m grateful for her tireless work to ensure justice for trafficking victims survivors.
The @StateDept’s Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange Program provides scholarships to high school students from Muslim countries to study in the US vice versa. I met with these remarkable students who are studying in different schools around #Ohio earlier today.
Absent full transparency regarding how Confucius Institutes operate and full reciprocity for U.S. cultural outreach efforts on college campuses in China, Confucius Institutes should not continue in the United States
.@SenatorCarper and I learned that schools in the United States— from kindergarten to college—have provided a level of access to the Chinese government that the Chinese government has refused to provide to the United States.
Today @SenatorCarper and I unveiled a new Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report that details the lack of transparency at Chinese-funded Confucius Institutes located at more than 100 American universities.
Congratulations on the new gig, Sully! America is grateful for your devoted service ���
Honored to speak at the End Modern Slavery Initiative event today. I’ve made combating human trafficking a top priority in the #Senate worked to enact bipartisan legislation, including most recently #SESTA, to better help survivors hold traffickers accountable.
I strongly support @USEmbassyKyiv remarks, and I stand with the Ukrainian people in support of #Ukraine’s territorial integrity #CrimeaIsUkraine.
Enjoyed delivering remarks to Edward Jones Grassroots Taskforce today about my bipartisan work w/ @SenCardin on our Retirement Security Savings Act, which will help Americans save more for retirement expand access to workplace retirement plans and IRAs.
Always great to sit down with the #Ohio Association of Broadcasters, in town for the annual National Association of Broadcasters' (@nabtweets) State Leadership Conference.
I had the honor of meeting with 2014 Nobel Peace recipient, Kailash Satyarthi, this morning. He has rescued more than 87,000 from a life of slavery in child labor and is a global leader to end human trafficking.
Packed house this morning for our weekly #BuckeyeCoffee. It was great to meet with so many #Ohioans to discuss wide-ranging topics facing our great state.
Proud to stand w/ @FOPofOhio all officers that have answered the call to serve protect #Ohio. I recently reintroduced the Law Enforcement Officers Equity Act to ensure that the men women who put their lives on the line to protect us receive the benefits they rightly deserve
Productive meeting with 40 mayors city officials from around #Ohio w/@amppublicpower Ohio Municipal Electric Association today to discuss ways to improve permitting, infrastructure projects, and energy efficiency around the state. #jobs
Always great to talk with the bright students from @GilmourAcademy on their annual trip from Gates Mill, #Ohio to DC. We even had a surprise guest appearance from @VP Pence! Excited to see what the future has in store for these incredible young adults.
Students in the #Portsmouth area  interested in attending one of our nation’s prestigious military service academies should attend this informational session tonight, sponsored by @RepBillJohnson @SenSherrodBrown myself, at Shawnee State. More info here
Great to sit down with #Ohio disabled #veterans (@davhq) to thank them for their service to our country discuss productive ways I can help on the federal level to ensure veterans the care they deserve.
I have worked to reduce high prices set by drug companies. Last year, my Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations released a report that resulted in @kaleo significantly reducing the price of its naloxone product used to reverse opioid overdoses.
Yesterday, I introduced the #REFUNDAct w/ @SenatorDurbin, which could save seniors taxpayers billions in prescription drug costs by reducing wasteful spending on discarded medications. Our gov’t should only pay for products patients actually use.
Looking forward to the @SenFinance hearing today w/ Chairman @ChuckGrassley to examine the high prices set by drug manufacturers. You can watch the hearing here at 10am:
Last year I visited Rickenbacker in Columbus to participate in the ribboncutting for the KC-135 flight deck simulator at the #Ohio Air National Guard 121st Refueling Wing. Proud of Rickenbacker’s vital efforts to protect our nation. Here’s more on my visit
I introduced my bipartisan Trade Security Act in order to reform the Section 232 national security trade tool to its original intent and curb its abuse. I'm proud of the support this legislation has received from #Ohio national business leaders:
Thanks to Sen. @JohnBoozman for his support of my End Government Shutdowns Act.  He says it perfectly, passing this legislation would remove the ability to weaponize a govt shutdown. Shutdowns never work, hurt govt workers cost the taxpayers more money.

Over the past decade annual visitors to our #NtnlParks has increased by 58M people. Keeping up w/ aging infrastructure more visitors means @NatlParkService can only focus on immediate maintenance needs. My Restore Our Parks Act will address the long-delayed maintenance backlog.
According to their report Customs Border Protection seized 6,423lbs of cocaine, 532lbs of heroin, 332lbs of fentanyl more than 10,000lbs of meth from Oct’17 thru Aug’18. Enhanced security at the border is vital to keeping these drugs out of the US
Misusing Section 232 to impose tariffs on autos auto parts will hurt the #Ohio auto industry #jobs. I’ve introduced the bipartisan Trade Security Act to reform 232 so that it’s used as originally intended.
.@CherryStMission is an organization that provides programming built around 1:1 mentorship educational development. Impressive tour there Friday to discuss how my bipartisan #JOBSAct would help to cover programs like the ones offered at Cherry St.
I enjoyed my visit to Staub Manufacturing Solutions this week to hear how they’re benefitting from #taxreform including expanding their business, raising #wages, creating new #jobs, more benefits bonuses for workers! #ItWorks
A new technologically advanced Naval ship will bear the name of the great city of #Cleveland. Our brave men women of the @USNavy deserve the most advanced weapons systems in the world I’m proud that hardworking #Ohioans are a part of its completion.
To protect and preserve our #NationalParks, I introduced the bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act to address the nearly $12B in long-delayed maintenance at our parks, including the more than $100M at the 8 #Ohio sites.
Protecting preserving the #GreatLakes is one of my top priorities in the #Senate. I’m proud that my efforts to ensure full funding for the #GreatLakes Restoration Initiative in the recent funding bill that passed the #Senate were successful. #GLRI
The current E-Verify program is optional allows too many people to use fraudulent identity documents circumvent the law. My bipartisan E-Verify Act will require employers to use this vital program to ensure they are hiring legal workers.
I’m urging my colleagues to pass my bipartisan Trade Security Act which will help protect #Ohio workers consumers by reforming the Section 232 trade tool ensuring it is only used for genuine national security threats. #jobs
I heard powerful stories this week from the women participating in the Pathways Program in #FranklinCo which helps them overcome addiction take back control of their lives. Proud that this impressive program has received more than $800K through my #CARA law.
#OpportunityZones have the potential to transform low-income cities towns. I fought for the inclusion of this incentive in #taxreform. This week, I participated in a roundtable in #Cleveland to discuss how #OZs will help boost investments #jobs in struggling areas in #Ohio.
Last year I visited the @HopewellOhioNPS was able to see firsthand the unmet maintenance needs to the exterior of the visitor center along the trails. My Restore Our Parks Act will address the many long delayed maintenance projects throughout the #NPS system.
So many of our greatest American songs music come from the African American community. During #BHM, the #Cleveland Rock Roll Hall of Fame has several showcases honoring the incredible contributions of African American singer/songwriters. More here:

On the 5th anniv. of the #Ukranian Revolution of Dignity I’m proud to introduce a bipartisan resolution honoring those courageous individuals who participated in the #Maidan protests #heavenlyhundred who gave their lives. The US stands firmly w/ #Ukraine
Good read from @WSJ on the importance in closing the skills-gap in our country. In #Ohio, there are hundreds of in-demand #jobs but not enough qualified workers to fill them. I’ve made it a priority to strengthen CTE programs to bridge this gap.
Late last year, I led a bipartisan letter calling for $60 million for the Nonprofit Security Grant Program in light of the Pittsburgh synagogue tragedy. I’m glad we got that done last week; we need to stay vigilant and keep our Jewish institutions and all houses of worship safe.
It was great stopping by Scotts MiracleGro to hear how they're expanding and using savings from #taxreform to invest in their workers thru increased wages retirement benefits.
#OpportunityZones have the potential to boost investments #jobs in struggling communities throughout #Ohio. Appreciate the feedback I received today from @GCPartnership roundtable I will continue my work to help #smallbiz succeed flourish.
Productive discussion today with @GCPartnership at Miceli’s Dairy in #Cleveland about how the city #Ohio will benefit from #OpportunityZones tax incentives I fought for in #taxreform. They will encourage investment #job creation in low-income communities.
Last fall I visited the William Howard Taft National Historic site saw firsthand its unmet maintenance needs, like needed roof repairs to the house. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act would address these maintenance needs those in the 7 other #NationalPark sites in #Ohio.
Today I heard powerful stories from women who voluntarily participate in the Pathways Program in #FranklinCo, which received more than $800K through my #CARA law to support the incredible work this program does in helping women overcome addiction.
Productive visit today w/ #FranklinCo @ComMarilynBrown, community leaders participants of the Pathways Program. The county is making great use of the #CARA funding I fought for to support a voluntary recovery program for incarcerated women w/ substance use disorders.
Incredible work from Customs Border Protection agents who seized more than 906lbs of meth at the southern border. Strengthening our border security is critical to our efforts to help stop the influx of these drugs into our communities. More from @usnews
Exciting to hear how #taxrefrom has positively impacted Staub Manufacturing Solutions during a roundtable discussion yesterday. They’ve expanded their biz, increased wages, reinvested in their workforce, provided a 401(k) match delivered more bonuses! 
Today I again heard from #Ohio employers who are saying  there is a shortage of qualified workers. I am working to strengthen #CTE programs to help workers get the skills they need to fill the good-paying #jobs that are available.
I had a productive discussion today w/ the leadership from Staub Manufacturing, the National Association of Manufacturers (@ShopFloorNAM), other local business leaders on how to strengthen CTE programs to help close the skills gap in #Ohio to fill in-demand #jobs
Earlier today I had the opportunity to meet some remarkable courageous women in #Dayton who were once trafficked and now are on their journey to healing with the help of Oasis House. Listened to their stories and grateful for the progress they are making.

The #GreatLakes provide drinking water for 40M people, contribute $10B in tourism each year thousands of #jobs across the region. Im proud the bipartisan funding agreement signed into law last week fully funds the GLRI program I’ve long championed

Last week on the @SenateFloor I highlighted my bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act. Our #NationalParks, including the 8 sites in #Ohio, are in desperate need of funding for the $12B backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects. We must preserve protect these national treasures.
I have known Jeff Rosen for more than a decade to be a man of integrity and I know he will serve our country well as the Deputy Attorney General. I look forward to supporting his confirmation.
I’m proud the @USNavy has named the LCS31 after the great city of #Cleveland. Our men women of the @USNavy deserve the most advanced weapons systems in the world this ship will provide that. Look forward to the christening of the USS Cleveland in 2023
I hope the administration takes a step back reconsiders any auto tariffs. Misuse of Section 232 trade tool hurts #Ohio workers consumers. My bipartisan Trade Security Act will reform the 232 tariff process increase congressional oversight.
Set aside repairs on a leaky roof risk ruining a home. Deferred maintenance can mean more $ in the long run. That’s why the #Senate needs to pass my bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act so we can address the long deferred maintenance backlog in our #NtlParks
For 30 years, the National Afro-American Museum Cultural Center in #Wilberforce #Ohio has been a home of inspiring compelling African-American history. This #BHM I encourage all to visit see the current exhibit on the many ways African-Americans served our nation in WWII.

A top priority of mine is helping to close the skills gap in #Ohio for businesses large small. I was honored to receive an award last week from the National Association of Community Colleges (@CCTrustees) for my bipartisan #JOBSAct to strengthen Career Technical Education.
I’ve been honored to work for 2 presidents. #GeorgeHWBush was an early mentor lifelong friend. And I was privileged to serve his son, #GeorgeWBush, in two cabinet roles. On this #PresidentsDay I’m thankful for all those who’ve served in the highest office of our land.
The #Senate Homeland Security Governmental Affairs cmte passed 2 of my bipartisan bills to increase federal gov’t #transparency online. Taxpayers are entitled to full government transparency I hope the #Senate will pass these bills soon.
The #Ohio Erie Canalway National Heritage Area supports 4,200 Ohio #jobs and I’m proud the #Senate passed legislation to ensure this beautiful #Ohio treasure receives is full funding. I’m hopeful it will be signed into law soon.
We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable but misusing our trade tools can endanger #Ohio #jobs our economy. That’s why I introduced the Trade Security Act to preserve the Section 232 tool for genuine threats to national security.
George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush were true patriots who dedicated their lives in service to our nation. I was proud to introduce the George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush Coin Act w/ Sen. @JohnCornyn honoring my dear friends.
My bipartisan E-Verify Act will require employers to use the vital program to ensure they are hiring legal workers. The current program is optional allows too many people to use fraudulent identity documents and circumvent the law.
It was my honor to host a reception last weekend to honor congratulate my Class of 2019 Military Service Academies nominees. I’m proud of the remarkable records accomplishments of these young men women
The bipartisan funding agreement is the most funding #Congress has ever provided for new barrier construction along our southern border. This is an important step forward combined with other initiatives will strengthen our border security
I fought hard to secure full funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative so I’m pleased to report we were successful. This program is critically important to our efforts to protect preserve #LakeErie and the #GreatLakes.
.@WrightPattAFB Springfield Air National Guard Base #DaytonVA all play a critical role in our national security caring for our vets in #Ohio. A new study by #Dayton Development Commission highlights how important they are to the Miami Valley economy
When there’s a genuine national security threat the Section 232 trade remedy is a vital tool. However, when misused can hurt #Ohio workers economy. My bipartisan Trade Security Act ensures this tool is only used for legitimate national security threats
100s of bird species migrate through #Ohio each year, making it one of the top destinations for birding. This week, the Senate passed my Migratory Birds of the Americas Conservation Act to protect preserve these bird populations.

For centuries our #NatlParks have generated awe wonder for the millions who visit. My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help fund long-delayed maintenance projects so people can enjoy parks like #Ohio's Cuyahoga Valley National Park (@CVNPNPS) for generations to come
Honored to have received the #Ohio AMVETS legislator of the year award. @ohioamvets does great work for our veterans in Ohio.
Grateful for your support! Urging the #Senate to pass this bipartisan common-sense legislation to preserve protect our #NationalParks for generations to come.
Thank you for your support!

My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help address the nearly $100M backlog of long-delayed maintenance projects at #Ohio’s 8 parks including Cuyahoga Valley National Park (@CVNPNPS) the Perry Victory International Memorial on #LakeErie.
Last night on the @SenateFloor I addressed the @NatlParkService $12B backlog of long-delayed maintenance projects. It’s vital we preserve these national treasures for generations to come my bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act will help achieve this goal.
The #KashmirTerrorAttack yesterday was a horrific and devastating act of terrorism. These cowardly terrorist acts have no place in our world. The United State stands in solidarity with #India in condemning this attack.
While the specific funding for new barriers ($1.375B) is less than @POTUS’ requested, it is more than Congress has ever provided for new barrier construction in past years. 55 miles in new barriers combined w/ other initiatives is a positive step forward for border security.
The bipartisan funding agreement, w/ $22.5B in total border security funding (only about $300M or 1.3% less than @POTUS requested), makes southern border more secure through more barrier construction, more technology cameras, better screening at ports of entry.
Happy Valentine’s Day to my Valentine, my wife, Jane. The best mom ever, my best friend and the perfect partner to have in all of life’s ups and downs. #HappyValentinesDay

My bipartisan Restore Our Parks Act has received praise from @PEWtrusts, the National Parks Conservation Association(@NPCA), @USTravel Association, the National Trust for Historic Preservation(@SavingPlaces) Trust for the National Mall (@NationalMallNPS)
Thanks to @SenatorWarner @SenAlexander and @SenAngusKing for their leadership support in introducing the Restore Our Parks Act. We must address the backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects in our #NationalParks to protect them for future generations.

Our #NationalParks have inspired Americans to explore the natural beauty of our nation. Unfortunately due to a nearly $12B backlog in long-delayed maintenance projects, many parks are in desperate need of repair. My bipartisan bill will address this backlog to preserve our parks.
I enjoyed meeting with Dr. Janet Kavandi, Center Director of #Cleveland’s @NASAglenn this morning. It was exciting to hear about NASA Glenn’s pivotal role in developing and testing projects like #Orion, a spacecraft that will take humans beyond earth’s orbit to deep space.

Today the #Senate Homeland Security Governmental Affairs cmte passed 2 of my bipartisan bills to increase federal gov’t #transparency online. Citizens deserve access to taxpayer-funded reports studies. I urge the #Senate to pass these bills soon.

I enjoyed meeting with the #Ohio Association of Community Colleges (@OACC) yesterday. I’ve worked closed with them to develop my bipartisan #JOBSAct legislation to ensure more #Ohioans have the skills training they need to match the in-demand #jobs available today.
