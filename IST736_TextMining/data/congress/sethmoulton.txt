What she said.
#IWD2019 reminds us of a value that we must keep every day: everyone is created equal.
For International Women's Day, I want to tell you about my Aunt Sheila.
Our politics would be better if we had more people like @McCreadyForNC stepping up to serve.
We took back the House so we could drive legislation that will improve our democracy. #HR1 is a stark contrast to what Republicans have spent the last two years debating.
Thinking about the hardworking people looking for a job in Lordstown today. You deserve a government that has your back.
Like so many towns and cities across the US, #MA06 is home to Dreamers who counted on #DACA protection and #TPS recipients who fled disaster unrest.They're our friends, neighbors, and colleagues. I'm proud to stand with them and #ProtectTheDream here in Congress.
I showed Emmy the first woman to serve in U.S. Congress, Rep. Jeannette Rankin--a champion of women's rights and a self-proclaimed pacifist. At the time of her death (at age 92), she was considering another run for Congress to protest the Vietnam war. #WomensHistoryMonth
Last week the president said he trusted Kim. Clearly we can’t.
We have to reinvest in science and research in America. That’s how we’ll get safe replacements for opioids, carbon capture for our planet, and amazing breakthroughs like this:
Elections matter. None of this would be possible without a Democratic majority.Trump will probably veto the resolution, but fortunately there’s an election coming up for him too.
My friends on the House Oversight Committee are going to be busy.

We should be strengthening our allies, not cozying up to our enemies. Trump’s failed summit with Kim Jong-un is just another example of why we need to get moral leadership back into the White House.
After 54 years, @repjohnlewis is still walking across Edmund Pettus Bridge in the name of freedom and equality. Today I was proud to walk with him.
This just makes sense. Veterans are already using marijuana--let's make it safe.
I worked on border security between Iraq and Iran as a Marine, so I know what a border emergency looks like. This isn’t an emergency. It’s the time to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
Trump's wall wouldn't have stopped these pineapples.
This is the kind of headline I came to Congress for.
Good leadership often means telling hard truths to your friends. Donald Trump can't even tell hard truths to our enemies.
Unsurprising.
For years, Congress has responded to mass shootings with thoughts and prayers and moments of silence. That changes today. We passed HR8 to make sure all gun sales require a background check. Time for the Senate to step up. #EndGunViolence
It’s hard not to think that we probably shouldn’t have Individual One meeting with Kim Jong Un about nuclear weapons.
The situation in #NC09 is a reminder that we need to change the way elections are done in America. We need Automatic Voter Registration, paid time off for voting days, and an end to gerrymandering voter suppressionEveryone should be able to vote, and every vote should matter.
Future generations will thank us for taking on climate change.
A good deal in Hanoi would consist of:- Comprehensive nuclear agreement that includes plans for sequenced disarmament- Rigorous inspection and verification- An end to ballistic missile developmentBad deal:- Any further compromises without a serious plan
"Under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a nat. emergency today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border." -58 bipartisan former senior national security officials.
Nicolas Maduro needs to go.
Climate "nightmare" is putting it lightly, but we need to ensure we’re listening to science ourselves as we put together the smartest plan we can to meet this historic challenge.
This is awesome.
This reminds me of how proud I am to have an ‘F’ NRA rating.

Trump again assaults American women and families.
We're doing what we can in the House. Time for the Senate to step up. Call your senators: 202-224-3121
The first mammal and certainly not the last.
Let's do this @McCreadyForNC.
This rhetoric is dangerous and he knows it.
White supremacy is terrorism.
Thank you for your service, Cpl. Don Graves.
We can't only talk about the gun violence epidemic after mass shootings.This epidemic is taking the lives of young people every day and it's time we do something about it.
This has become normal.
Election fraud plain and simple. Time for the North Carolina Election Board to do the right thing here and hold a special election.
For the record...fast trains are good. If we invested in infrastructure, we might actually have them like the rest of the world.
Thanks, Obama. Happy #PresidentsDay.
Not that we needed a smoking gun, but... @McCreadyForNC deserves a fair election and the people of North Carolina deserve to have their voices heard. This is 2019, not 1959.
.@MikieSherrill is tough, creative, and courageous. She is what a new generation of service-driven leadership looks like.
When our military families are not safe in their own homes, on American soil, leadership has failed.
We don't need a wall.Mexico isn't going to pay for it. Diverting funds from the military to pay for it is bad.Trump is the national emergency.Happy Friday.

Donald Trump is the national emergency.
Hey @liznmoulton, will you be my Valentine?
Together with the students of Lynn Classical High School, we created a tribute to the 17 lives lost in the Parkland shooting one year ago today. I'm in awe of the strength of all the students who are at the forefront of the fight to end gun violence in America. #MSDStrong

Calling out Saudi Arabia for the torture, dismemberment, and murder of Khashoggi is not a mistake. The only mistake here is electing a president who surrounds himself with people like Tom Barrack who are the antithesis of what we stand for as a

Climate change shouldn't be a partisan issue. This is about the future of our planet. I know what kind of world I want my daughter, Emmy, to grow up in. And sitting back and waiting for change isn't going to cut it. #GreenNewDeal
“Of 1,435 human trafficking indictments since 2009: only 26 instances of kidnapping and only one mention of a victim being bound with duct tape.” If we're talking about human trafficking, let's talk about what's real.
I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of the Green New Deal. Climate change won’t wait, so neither can we.
Moral courage isn't often rewarded in Congress but Assistant Secretary of Defense Owen West clearly has it. Thank you for continuing to serve our country.
#Factcheck Hate crimes are up because of hateful rhetoric. We need moral leaders who set an example for the country through their words and deeds.
#Factcheck Childhood cancers are pre-existing conditions. The president and his party have voted over and over again to take us back to a time where cancer survivors could be denied affordable health insurance. I’ll continue to fight that every time.
.@realdonaldtrump If you support ICE, you should pay them.
#FactCheck: President Trump hasn’t put forward a single jobs bill.
Sarai Childs chose to serve in the @USCG because she wanted to do more for our country. Her work saves lives. This is who the shutdown impacted--Americans with families, bills to pay, children to care for, who were forced to work without pay while defending our nation.
Trayvon Martin would have been 24 today. He should have been 24 today.
42,000 members of the Coast Guard had to work without pay during the shutdown. Sarai Childs, from my district, is one of them.I'm proud to have her as my guest as a reminder that shutdowns need to stop. People like Sarai should never be used for political leverage again.

Today is the first day of #BlackHistoryMonth, which should be every month.
I thought this was a parody account.
We should be working with our NATO allies - not abruptly pulling out of treaties with no strategy. Yet another reckless move for our national security.
There should be one more Democrat in the House. Dan McCready’s election was stolen through suppression of black voters’ rights. It’s wrong, and we should be a lot more angry about it.
Grateful to our AG @maura_healey for exposing the recklessness and deceit behind one of the major generators of the opioid addiction crisis.
And they did it without a wall.
As the father of a 3-month-old it makes me sick to watch this. The impact of the President’s manufactured human rights crisis will be felt long after we forget about his cries for a wall.
Missing the days when the President saying “I’ve got you covered” meant health insurance.
Our service men and women deserve a concrete plan that will end the longest war in American history for good—no going back. I will continue pressing the Administration to present a plan to win lasting peace in Afghanistan.
We shouldn’t kid ourselves - veterans use marijuana. We have an obligation to make it safe, regulate it, and protect the benefits of vets who would like to discuss it with their doctors. @mattgaetz and I intro’d legislation that would do all of the above.
“The intelligence people”... put their lives on the line to collect the intel that keeps us safe and strong.
If we want to get smart, let’s have the debate about drones, cameras, and motion sensors. 59% of Americans oppose a wall at our southern border because they want security that works.
It’s time to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment once and for all. Period.
Hate crimes have increased 17% in the last year. Jussie Smollett was called racist slurs AND homophobic slurs. This hideous attack reminds us of our nation's dark history, which unfortunately for many Americans, is still a real threat today.
Amazing choice!
No issue is more important for our children and our grandchildren than addressing Climate Change. That’s why I support the Green New Deal.
Good.
With $11 billion we could have paid for healthcare for over a million Americans for 1 year. It took the president 3 weeks to waste this much money.
Today is #DataPrivacyDay. In the last few years:- Russia hacked our election- The data of 143M Americans was exposed in the Equifax hack- We found out that Facebook was using (and selling) more of our data than previously disclosedWe need a cyber wall, not a border wall.

Great news, but let's not pretend for a second that Trump's shutdown won't have a lasting impact. This wasn't worth it. Let's make sure it doesn't happen again.
I live in Salem, MA. Can confirm that this is still false.
BREAKING: *FAA Halts flights into N.Y.'s Laguardia on Air Traffic Control staff shortage.
An important thread from a courageous leader.
U.S. attorneys’ offices rely on our federal agents to collect information on our country’s most dangerous criminals. Currently, federal agents are not getting paid, and assets are being compromised. We are less safe. He owns this.
Transgender troops deserve medical care.
To my wife, Liz: Your strength and warmth as a new mother gives me so much hope for our daughter's future. #NationalComplimentDay
If a deal isn’t reached today, federal workers will miss a second paycheck. Rent, medical needs, child care, gas, groceries, all hang in the balance for too many Americans. Unacceptable.
...witness tampering...obstruction of justice...
Good news from North Carolina.
All across America community members are pitching in to take care of our own until the government reopens. This is the America I believe in.
Federal workers making the choice between paying the mortgage or buying food for their families. Is America great again yet?
Thank you for having me, and thank you for inspiring our community to serve one another.
Are we done with this cruelty yet, @GOP?
If you want to serve you should be able to. I never had concerns about the gender identity of a comrade in the Marines. I do have concerns about an erratic Commander-in-Chief.
Shutdown day 32. Thinking of the USCG family I met this weekend -- 3 year old was just accepted to a great preschool but they can’t enroll him because mom’s next paycheck isn’t guaranteed. Americans want us to do our jobs open their government.
Today, let's remember all Dr. King did for us. And do our best to follow in his footsteps.
RT @votevets: Please listen to this man, who also served the US in Vietnam, who was harassed by #MAGA cap wearing kids, yesterday.Please…
Thinking today about the four Americans killed in Syria and their families back home. They gave their lives for our country. May they rest in peace.
Can’t imagine an MLK weekend without the historic sites that pay homage to his legacy. Great move by Delta. Now Republicans should reopen the government rest of the parks too.
In today’s America, Trump isn’t just content to cripple our economy with a needless trade war, his policies force even those who have jobs to wait in bread lines for their next meal.
Important thread by @WeAreALPA President Capt. Joe Depete. 28 day shutdown = 28 days of putting American lives at risk. It’s time to reopen the government.
#BREAKING: The U.S. Government.
If you can’t make a compelling argument in 28 days, you’re generally not going to come up with something on the 29th.
Old enough to remember when Commanders in Chief took responsibility for their decisions.
Happy Birthday to @MichelleObama! Your investment in America’s children will mean a brighter future for us all. Thank you.
Four Americans were killed and our commander in chief is clueless. What is our strategy? Why are we pulling troops out? We need answers.
Important info if you receive SNAP benefits: due to the shutdown, Feb’s SNAP benefits will be paid out between Jan 17th and 20th. For more info, see the MA DTA’s furlough guide:
The President has abandoned his duty to our Armed Forces as Commander in Chief.
We might never know how much money was lost to the #TrumpShutdown because the government agencies that monitor economic data are closed.
This is just a reminder of the work we still need to do to protect the LGBTQ community (especially students) in this country, and that the leaders of our nation aren’t doing that work.
I think most Americans remember this day and the gratitude we shared for the bravery of Captain Sully and his crew. The White House is devoid of leadership, but this is a good reminder of the leaders who walk among us everyday.
For those still asking “But why would Russia want to interfere in our elections?” This is why.
United States Coast Guard: Front line of border defenseFront line of stopping the flow of drugs into the countryCurrently unfunded by the President of the United States because Of “border security”
It took Trump 2 days to answer this basic question. I wonder why.
Federal workers want to serve their country but instead they're missing paychecks.
If you are impacted by the shutdown and live in #MA06, we want to hear from you. You can share your story here:
The President should try a wall built of thoughts and prayers. Isn’t that how we address safety concerns in this country?
Looks like establishment feathers are ruffled because she's trying to get things done... that's generally a sign someone’s doing something right around here.
So Mexico isn’t paying for the wall… disaster victims are.
Coast Guard families are being told to become dog walkers or host a garage sale. A real morale booster.
Food-borne illnesses kill 3,000 people each year. FDA inspectors are furloughed. This was never about your safety.
Felipe Gomez Alonzo was 8. Jakelin Caal Maquin was 7. They died in the custody of the President’s administration and he can’t even bring himself to say their names.
Since the President is at the border today as our Commander in Chief, will he visit our deported veterans (a term that shouldn’t exist)? He could learn a lot from their sacrifice and bravery.
I worked on border security between Iraq and Iran when I was in the Marines. Iran is a way bigger threat than Mexico, so this was a national security priority…Spoiler: We didn’t build a wall.
Parents warning daycares that they can’t pay next week’s bill. Families coming to terms with the loss of Friday’s paycheck. SNAP benefits and Section 8 set to run dry in February. This is pure negligence by the President of the United States.
Emmy Moulton is here to brighten up your Wednesday. (How is it possible to be so cute?)
Until the government is fully reopen, I will decline my pay. Many people do not have the luxury of choosing, so it is out of respect to them that I've made this choice. If you live in #MA06 and are in need of assistance due to the shutdown, my office is here to help.
Donald Trump doesn’t know what it’s like to rely on a tax refund and now he's holding yours hostage.
We can’t let Trump’s abuse of power and constant lying dictate our path forward. Mr President, the American people want their paychecks this Friday... they don’t want to be saddled with the bill for a wall that only protects your fragile ego.
If Trump wants to build a wall that will actually work and is actually needed, let's build a cyber wall to protect our democracy from Russia.
This is political theatre. These games are putting our national security at risk.
Tonight I was proud to end my boycott of moments of silence in Congress for gun violence because we’re ACTUALLY doing something about it. A strong Dem majority put forward crucial bipartisan gun safety legislation. I'm proud of our party and the ever inspiring @GabbyGiffords.
Doesn't seem like a "fair and honest" candidate to me... #NC09
History repeats itself.
Eight years to the day after Rep. Gabby Giffords was injured in a senseless act of gun violence, far too many families in America know the sting of a similar pain. Today, the House will take a huge step forward toward safety for American families.
If the government shutdown continues through Friday Jan. 11th, many federal workers will miss their expected paychecks. Even though the government is shutdown, there are still resources available to you, and my staff and I are standing by, ready to help.
Call your Senators. Demand that the Senate pass the House’s legislation to reopen the government -- the same legislation they already passed last year. (202) 224-3121
- Inspections, oversight and communications systems threatened- air traffic controllers, system maintenance personnel, and air marshals working unpaid.- hundreds of (unpaid) TSA screeners are calling in sick.This shutdown was never about safety.
Donald Trump has four days to reopen the government before people start missing paychecks. Mr. President, I don’t think “pride” is the word you’re looking for.
A 14 year old girl’s death could have been prevented if the President did his job and kept our government running. Instead, our National Parks have remained open and unstaffed and three people are dead.
Common sense gun reforms like universal background checks are supported by 90% of Americans. It’s been time for our country to take this crucial step toward safety for a long time.
If he could be the #1 expert on keeping the government open that would be great.
Trump: Says he wants to keep America "safe" by building a wall.Also Trump: Shuts down the Government leaving many Americans without crucial services for their safety.
Boston used to be the envy of the nation when it came to transportation, but thanks to decades of neglecting our ailing subway and commuter rail systems, that's no longer the case.
.@IlhanMN, you are proof that the American Dream still exists. I look forward to working together in Congress to ensure the next generation of Ilhans are encouraged to pursue a future as bright as yours.

�9 Federal Departments lacking funding�¼ of the government shutdown�800,000 employees will go without pay next week�1 Freshman Democratic class ready to make history and reopen the government
Just to clarify -- you pass a $10 billion tax break for the wealthy then furlough the IRS employees who would be able to explain it to the public during tax season?
2018 was a tumultuous year, but I’ll always remember it first as the year that gave us Emmy. In 2019 I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work just like every other year, but this time I’ve got another strong woman by my side. Happy New Year everyone!
Is the incentive that this Administration and your party will start to care that children are dying at the border, @LindseyGrahamSC?
Let's hope 2019 picks up where 2018 left off and makes this country-wide already.
Meeting Richard was an honor. Though he has left us, the memory of his service and dedication to our country will live on.
Facts are facts: Trump’s obsession with an expensive and useless "wall" is what's keeping our Government shutdown.
Trump's shutdown means that payments under the Violence Against Women Act helping victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and stalking will be delayed. Shameful.
Happy holidays!
RT @yfreemark: Just reminded myself that the distance between NYC and Chicago is almost exactly that between Beijing and Shanghai, and that…
Classic GOP move - order suspension votes on over four dozen minor bills but block ANY debate or consideration of bills stopping the inhumane Saudi war in Yemen.
Bottom line: The President of the United States just shut down our government in a political stunt to get American taxpayers to foot the bill for his ineffective border wall that he promised Mexico would pay for. And he can’t even get enough votes in his own party to support him.
Dictators advising military operations while our own Secretary of Defense is kept in the dark. Utterly shameful. The United States has become a puppet of authoritarian regimes under this president. Becomes less surprising Mattis is resigning by the day.
If Mar-a-Lago was run by civil servants maybe Trump would care about a shutdown at Christmas.
I've had the privilege of working closely with Jay to drive economic development in Lynn. He is a thoughtful public servant and I'm grateful for his service to our Commonwealth.
Mattis:- Tells Trump not to pull out of Iran Deal. He does.- Tells Trump to counter Russia. He doesn’t.- Tells Trump North Korea is still a threat. Trump claims victory.- Tells Trump to value our allies and partners. Trump does the opposite.- Syria is the last straw.
I can't think of a more appropriate way to end a Republican-led Congress than with a Republican-led shutdown.
I am proud to announce my National Service bill with @SenDuckworth. Our country benefits when more of our young people feel like they have a stake in its future.
