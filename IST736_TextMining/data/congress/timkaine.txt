President Trump wants to pull 6 billion dollars from the Pentagon budget to build his wall, even as our military housing is rife with serious safety hazards and desperately needs those construction funds. Come on.
It’s been 17 years since Congress authorized the Iraq War, and 28 since the Gulf War. Today, I introduced a bill to repeal those AUMFs—we need not be a nation at permanent war, and we cannot risk future abuse of these authorizations by the
What Virginia resident Aziza Al-Youssef has endured in a Riyadh prison over the past nearly 300 days is deeply disturbing. She must be released—as must all unjustly detained women’s right activists in Saudi Arabia. @GerryConnolly and I demand answers.
RT @VaNationalGuard: Congratulations to the Virginia National Guard's first female infantry officer on her promotion to captain!
Trump says Kim Jong Un didn’t know about brutalization of VA student Otto Warmbier. MBS had no knowledge of VA resident Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. Oh, and Putin had nothing to do with 2016 election interference... Why does he keep sticking up for dictators over his own people??
President Trump continues to praise Kim Jong Un despite zero evidence of denuclearization from North Korea in the entire year since the last summit. Before he heaps on more, we ought to see something in return.
How many more pipe-bombers, terrorists with kill lists, pizza parlor conspirators and Synagogue shooters will there be before this President tones down his rhetoric of hate, violence and lies?
This language from the President is a) a lie (Congress overwhelmingly passed a ban on infanticide 17 years ago that is still on the books) and b) essentially an incitement to violence against Democrats.
@vademocrats Thanks team. But you know, I just call them “jokes.”
With the painful controversies in Virginia, we find ourselves confronting again what it mean that our Commonwealth was the capital of a Confederacy dedicated to white supremacy. To move forward, we must look honestly at our history and today’s injustices.
It’s not that complicated. A judge has confirmed what we’ve known for some time—that federal prosecutors under then-Attorney Alex Acosta violated survivors’ rights when giving a serial sexual abuser “the deal of a lifetime.” He never should have been confirmed as Labor Secretary.
This week Virginia has the chance to be the 38th and final state needed to ratify the ERA. It’s far past time for us to show women around the world that we stand for their rights—and how fitting that it could be this VA legislature with a record number of women that gets it done!
Rainy Sunday so made soup for Anne and me. Check this vintage crock pot—at least 35 years old. American technology rocks!
Thank goodness Europe is committed to diplomacy and peace. US abandonment of Iran deal was idiotic and driven by Trump’s envy of Obama.   The professionals—Secretary Mattis, General Dunford—urged Trump to stay in.
-Removing lead from military housing-Making overseas bases safer -Upgrading hospitals that treat wounded troopsThese are the types of projects military construction funding is supposed to pay for when it isn’t stolen to build a wall that won’t make us safer.
A year ago this week, 17 families in Parkland experienced the worst day of their lives. We are holding them in our prayers and we also must honor them by taking action—commonsense gun reform can prevent more worst days from becoming reality if we stand up to say enough is enough.
Lieutenant Governor Fairfax should resign. The allegations against him detail atrocious crimes, and he can no longer effectively serve the Commonwealth. We cannot ever ignore or tolerate sexual assault.
One of the many reasons why we need to stop all US support for Saudi Arabia’s intervention in Yemen.
RT @BobbyScott: My statement with Senators @timkaine and @MarkWarner urging Governor Northam to resign.
I no longer believe Governor Northam can effectively serve as Governor of Virginia. The events of the past 24 hours have inflicted immense pain and irrevocably broken the trust Virginians must have in their leaders. He should step down and allow the Commonwealth to begin healing.

My End Shutdowns Act does exactly what it says: ends shutdowns. We cannot keep putting our federal workers and the American public through this!
This should be obvious: Women deserve equal pay! Yet they still only make 80 cents to every dollar paid to men, and the disparity is even worse for women of color.Today @PattyMurray, @MarkWarner and I are re-introducing the Paycheck Fairness Act to try to close that gap.
On #HolocaustMemorialDay, we remember the millions killed, including 6 million Jews. Not just to honor them, but also to ensure that atrocities in our history are never repeated. These crimes against humanity are unspeakable—but speak of them we must, in order to learn from them.
Make no mistake, federal employees standing strong—especially our air safety professionals—was key to ending the shutdown. We owe an apology and thanks to all who suffered through the #TrumpShutdown. And to think he said he was “proud” to do it!   You can’t close the USA.
@13DavidAlan Hey David - Congress passed our bill to pay federal employees back and I’ve introduced one to do the same for federal contractors.
Millions of Americans can breathe again. Like them, I'm relieved. But both parties must now work to reach a long-term compromise—and ensure no one can ever again hold public servants hostage by using a government shutdown as a negotiating tactic. Never. Again.
Why is our country treating people like this? Oh, right — because the president can’t get his way.
Today is the second missed paycheck for hundreds of thousands of federal employees. There’s no quippy tweet that can address this. We’re facing a mind-boggling humanitarian disaster, and it’s entirely man-made.
I just voted to end the shutdown and provide relief to millions of Americans. Deeply disappointed more of my Republican colleagues didn’t support reopening government as we negotiate a compromise. We *must* stay in session this weekend so both parties can work on a path forward.
Mr. President: A novel idea for you... End the shutdown today and give the speech as scheduled!
Just to be clear: I will keep trying to reopen the government until I'm blue in the face. (And then some.)
Shutting down the government is not a negotiating tool. People's lives are not leverage. If we give in to that kind of tactic, using Americans' lives and livelihoods as leverage, we can be sure the president will turn to it again and again—every time he doesn't get his way.

Spoken 55 years ago, but still as meaningful as the day Dr. King said those words. While he is no longer with us, his legacy, his example, and his wisdom continue to this very day.
So right now let's look back at some words of his that are particularly resonant today. In September of 1964, he spoke near the Berlin Wall—a wall built smack in the center of Berlin, separating west from east to keep people divided from one another. This is what he said:
If you turn on the TV right now, you're more likely to hear the words “wall” or “shutdown” than “justice” or “dream.” On a day when we ought to be reflecting about the dreams Dr. King had, we’re instead talking about the 31st day of shutdown and the hatred that compels it.
There is no progress on North Korea denuclearization unless and until the country discloses its sites. Without that, they are not serious and we should not pretend they are.
I took a highlighter to Bill Barr's memo to the DOJ from June 2018. Pretty interesting stuff.
Day 27: I just directly requested passage of a bill to reopen the government. Senator McConnell refused. Impossible to overstate exactly how ridiculous and offensive — not to mention unnecessary — this continuing shutdown is.
I gotta say, trying to take a long weekend off while our people all around the country are suffering... it's intolerable. You want to go home? Vote! We can reopen the government *right now* and fix this mess.
Virginia would be the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment - the deciding number to finally add this to the Constitution. Today, we're one step closer! On to the House - let's declare once and for all that women deserve full equality in our country!
I said it last week and I’ll say it again: The Senate must not recess without reopening the government. Period.
By keeping the government shut down, with law enforcement and others unpaid, Trump is making us less safe.
It should be payday for hundreds of thousands of federal workers. But thanks to Trump, many are actually getting pay stubs like this.He's treating them like the countless contractors he stiffed throughout his business career.
Why would the Senate leave town this weekend before voting to reopen the government?! Countless federal workers aren't being paid. People are worrying about how to pay bills. Congress could act now to fix it if Mitch McConnell would just take up a bill. Let's stay here and do it!

The Senate should vote on nothing else until we vote to reopen the government. Period. This shutdown is squeezing the finances of so many Americans, including thousands of federal workers who live in Virginia. As leaders, we can’t just whistle past the graveyard of this crisis.
This nation – the greatest nation on earth – looks like a laughingstock because the President’s fragile ego is leading him to shut everything down to get his way. It’s a temper tantrum more befitting a playpen than the Oval Office.
We’ve gone from Mexico paying for the wall to threatening thousands of federal workers that they may be furloughed or work without pay for YEARS if taxpayers don’t pay for the wall.
My New Year’s resolution is this phrase from the Senate oath of office I will take on January 3: “support and defend the Constitution of the United States.” My gut tells me that those words will have unique significance in 2019.
Even Trump’s team now admits a wall isn’t the smart way to do border
Merry Christmas to all! Anne and I are celebrating with her parents—90+ and going strong!
Today we think about the enduring message of a young couple turned away because there was no room, only to give birth to a child in a humble stable. The world is filled with millions seeking refuge, and we are all like innkeepers—let us choose wisely in how we treat them.
President Trump is gleefully punishing 800,000 of his own citizens by shutting down the government over the holidays. Virginia’s federal employees are so sick of this.
17 days ago, the military confirmed to me that there were no plans to change our strategy in Afghanistan.By ignoring the advice of his military advisors, Trump’s incoherent decision-making threatens our troops as they conduct a hasty withdrawal in an uncertain environment.
.@realDonaldTrump has no concept of the hard work our federal employees do every day to keep the country running. Forcing 800,000 of them to spend the holidays unsure about their next paycheck is cruel.
Secretary Mattis protects this nation against the worst instincts of a President who puts our national security at risk. His announced departure should alarm every American.
Court rules that the Trump administration cannot deny “room at the inn” to women seeking refuge from domestic violence.Christmas
I’m so proud to call @MarkWarner my *senior* Senator and a close friend of 38 years. There’s no one I’d rather serve Virginia with. Happy Birthday, Mark!
Tens of millions of Americans could lose their health insurance because of this ruling, including people with a history of cancer, diabetes or other pre-existing conditions.An appeals court needs to overturn this decision and Rs must stop these cruel attacks on our health care.
This is a silly sideshow from President Shutdown. Get your facts straight. And take a bipartisan deal. Don't inflict senseless pain on federal workers, our government, and America's reputation. You've done enough.
Now he demands $5B from taxpayers for the wall or we get a #TrumpShutdown. But:&gt; He said Mexico would pay for it&gt; Congress gave him $1.3B for border (not "boarder") security in '17 and he didn't spend it&gt; His own border patrol says we need sensors/fence/etc but the wall's dumb
President Trump blew the whole Iran deal up—over his own military leaders' objections, by the way—because of his insecurity over President Obama. An insecurity which, I might add, Saudi Arabia has played like a cheap fiddle.
The Iran deal did not "give" Iran one penny; it released Iran's own money frozen in bank accounts. It imposed restrictions and inspections on Iran for decades and prohibited the country from ever purchasing, acquiring or developing any nuclear weapons.
President Trump is delusional and clearly has never read the Iran deal.
The days of Congress enabling President Trump’s lies and misdirection are coming to an end. In divided government, Democrats aren’t gonna just go along with whatever the tweet du jour is. We’re going to demand he act like an adult.

As we begin Hanukkah, it’s important to consider how many Jewish families still don’t live free from hate because of the alarming rise in anti-Semitic acts in recent years. This holiday teaches us to seek the light - so let’s pray for more for the world, especially in dark times.
President Bush stands as a model of dignity in public service. From flying combat missions in WWII, to signing the Americans with Disabilities Act and bringing the Cold War to a peaceful end, he carried his accomplishments with such humility. My condolences to the Bush family.
Sorry, Mr. President. Three’s a crowd.
From excusing Jamal Khashoggi’s murder to aiding this disastrous war in Yemen, the Trump administration is essentially playing the part of Saudi Arabia’s defense lawyer.That’s not what America’s role in the world should be — and it’s time we all stand up against it.
For too long, the US has been involved in a Yemeni civil war that’s killed thousands and forced millions to the brink of famine. And as Trump kowtows to the Saudis, it’s up to Congress to demonstrate America’s moral leadership. We need to end US support for this war now.
More delays and misdirection from this President. He’s said the same thing before, but rejected a bipartisan offer to protect Dreamers and fund billions in border security this spring.He would rather use these young people as pawns in his game. Some “heart.”

Way to put the “I” back in Thanksgiving!
I mean, it’s literally second.
This is a slap in the face to the American intelligence officers who work daily to protect our country. And it’s yet another fawning prostration to a foreign authoritarian. It’s only a matter of time until actions like this by the President directly threaten our security.
That’s right, this goes beyond President Trump vs. Admiral McRaven. Or Trump vs. McCain. Or Trump vs. the Khans.It’s evidence of Trump’s open hostility to those who’ve served, and to those who’ve sacrificed more than he can even begin to comprehend.
We have just over 1 week to help @espyforsenate win an important race in Mississippi on Nov. 27. Last year, we turned Alabama blue, and we can do the same here. We can win — and add one more vote to protect and expand health care.Join us in this fight:
These sanctions are insufficient. After repeated Saudi lies about what happened to Khashoggi, the Trump administration appears to just be following the Saudi playbook: blame mid-level folks, exonerate those at the top.This was a state-sponsored murder. We need accountability.
Amazon chose Virginia because we have America’s most talented workforce. That didn’t happen by accident. When you focus on investing in job training and education, instead of cutting key priorities and excluding people, your economy gets more dynamic. Just look to VA for proof.
California is on fire and the President is attacking it and threatening to withhold aid. Firefighters there call it “ill-informed, ill-timed and demeaning.”“Ill” is a good word for it. There’s a leadership illness in the WH. Our country will come together stand up against it.
Virginia is home to more veterans than most states, and serving them in my work is one of my greatest honors — from job training to expanding access to health care. We thank all vets for their service this #VeteransDay. We are grateful for you and your sacrifices!
This is a start. Congress needs to stop all US support for war in Yemen and hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

President Trump isn’t interested in solving immigration problems. Earlier this year, we offered every penny of border security $ he asked for - and he turned it down. He would rather use lies and fear to try to stir people up right before an election than protect the country.

The Saudi “explanation” for murdering journalist and Virginia resident Jamal Khashoggi in a consulate—a fistfight gone wrong—is insulting.Since the Trump Administration won’t stand up against atrocity, Congress must.
Today’s news reminds us that foreign adversaries are still working hard to sow division in our country by seizing on the controversies du jour.It’s more important than ever that our leaders do not fan these flames—and instead rise above to unify and focus on our commonalities.
Medicaid expansion is a reality! Virginians can apply beginning November 1.And then vote on November 6 to safeguard this progress. Mitch McConnell said this week that a GOP majority could vote *again* to repeal health care for millions. We can’t let that happen.
When Mitch McConnell says "completely start over" here, what he means is take us back to when you could be discriminated against if you have a pre-existing condition. And that tens of millions would lose their insurance.We have to prevent the country from going back to that.
RT @attn: President @BarackObama doesn't have time for these 7 excuses not to vote.
President Trump’s response to Jamal Khashoggi’s disappearance reveals a man more willing to trust authoritarian leaders than reliable intelligence. It’s insulting to Jamal’s family and colleagues that this is what’s coming out of the world’s most powerful office.

Jamal Khashoggi is a Virginia resident, so his disappearance is personal to me. President Trump needs to raise this case immediately with Saudi Arabia and Turkey and demand answers. We should be extending support from our federal agencies for a real investigation.

We have to mourn the lack of seriousness the Senate showed toward credible allegations of sexual assault — but also be energized in demanding change and voting to elect a new Senate majority.
This is the Fairfax Jewish Community Center this morning.An insidious rise in hateful actions and anti-Semitism is happening in Virginia and across the country. We must meet it with fierce condemnation and an over-abundance of love and unity. We cannot allow hate to fester.
This gives new meaning to “Justice is Blind.”
Why not do a real investigation? Why limit Senate access to the report? Why limit public access to it?There can only be one of two answers: the Republican majority doesn’t care about allegations of sexual assault, or they’re worried of what a true investigation would uncover.
Senators can’t even discuss the report’s contents with the public. And they’re not releasing it to the public. This is an insult to Americans concerned about the future of the Supreme Court.
The “report” is available for Senators to review in a secure office but get this—there’s only ONE copy! That means Senators have to sign up for hourlong slots between now and the expected vote. There may not even be time for all 100 of us to read it before our first vote!
