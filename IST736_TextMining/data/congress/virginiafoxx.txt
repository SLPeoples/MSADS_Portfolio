It is appalling and indefensible that in the name of “choice” leaders in our country now support infanticide, but Republicans are prepared to continue leading the charge to support mothers with life-affirming options and uphold human dignity at every stage of life. (3/3)
At the same time, woefully misguided opponents are saying that “no one truly wants to abort a baby late in pregnancy.” If that is the case, then why are Dems lock-step in their denial of medical care to the children who, against all odds, have a fighting chance of survival? (2/3)
Watching the Senate vote against the motion to proceed on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivor Protection Act today was absolutely heart-breaking. This bill is about protecting newborn life—life that is viable outside the womb. It does nothing to change Roe v. Wade. (1/3)

that considers only 1 of 2 people involved in an abortion. I’ll continue to fight for the rights of the unborn, and I pray for our culture to realize their rights are not a threat to women’s rights. All life is valuable and deserves to be protected by law, not legally devalued.
And these policies lay bare the extreme agenda of the pro-abortion movement. Nothing warrants such evil and rendering the life of the unborn indefensible or permitting infanticide are no ways to ensure women’s health. These extremisms follow from a radical and callous belief...
These policies systematically remove the rights of the unborn from existing law, and the NY law goes so far as to revoke healthcare for babies born after a botched abortion. They fly in the face of the limits on abortion that most Americans support.
The Reproductive Health Act law being celebrated by pro-abortion activists in NY and VA’s Repeal Act bill supported by abortion advocates, pro-abortion legislators and @GovernorVA are horrifying indicators of the spreading of a culture of death in our society.

Congress shouldn’t be divided on keeping the gov’t open while fulfilling our duty to protect our nation. We shouldn’t let politics disrupt the services owed to taxpayers. I’ll keep working w/ all parties interested in solutions to end this #shutdown and make progress on the wall.
This shutdown was preventable, and it’s a shame that a strong border securing our nation is no longer the bipartisan priority it once was. Under Pres. Bush, the Secure Fence Act passed handily in the House and Senate, 283-138 and 80-19 respectively.
Gen. Mattis has been an outstanding leader of our military, now at its strongest in nearly a decade. He has served our country for 40+ years, and I thank him for his entire career protecting America’s national security as well as his strong leadership as Secretary of Defense.
especially when our libraries, universities and grant professionals are asking for federal grant reporting reform. The bipartisan #GREATAct will not die. However it’s a shame that good will for bipartisan, bicameral government modernization has. #grantdata #opendata
