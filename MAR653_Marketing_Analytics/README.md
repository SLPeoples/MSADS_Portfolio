## Description

Given a customer base of roughly 45,000 households, customers were segmented and profiled using K-Means Clustering based on factors such as income, shopping behavior, and demographics; this data was then used to identify frequently paired items using Association Rule Mining to develop a direct mail coupon campaign. Given a $10,000 liability margin, our goal was to determine the optimal coupon value that would encourage the targeted consumer base to increase item sales frequency and overall revenue.
